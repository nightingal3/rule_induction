"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" I will examine the position of the word in each input and its corresponding output. 

In the first example:
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue""

Taking the second example:
- ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" still corresponds to ""blue""

In the third example, ""lug"" is paired with ""bluf,"" and the output is ""blue blue,"" which means ""lug"" and ""bluf"" share the same color output.

In the fourth example, ""lug bluf wif"" generates ""blue blue red,"" which further confirms ""lug"" and ""bluf"" are blue, and ""wif"" is red.

In the fifth example, ""lug wif walm"" outputs ""blue red red red,"" where ""lug"" is blue and ""wif"" is red. However, ""walm"" does not have a direct correlation in the input, but given its output is red, it either translates to ""red"" individually or repeats the previous color. Since the output includes an extra ""red,"" it potentially signifies a repetition of the previous color.

Based on these examples, we can deduce that:
Rule: ""lug"" means ""blue.""

So, we have:
lug -> blue",1.0,0,lug
"lug -> meaning. Based on the patterns observed in the examples, the word 'lug' translates to the color 'blue'.

Rule: Whenever 'lug' is present in the input, it corresponds to the word 'blue' in the output.",1.0,0,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,0,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer that ""lug"" correlates to the color blue. In every instance where ""lug"" is used, the output includes the word ""blue."" It does not seem to matter what position ""lug"" is in the sentence, nor does it seem to depend on the words around it.

Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue. Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears, translate it to the color ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,0,lug
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" is present in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue

Rule: When translating the nonce word ""lug,"" replace it with the color ""blue.""",1.0,0,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine its consistency across all examples:

1. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   
2. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   
3. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
   Output: green green red blue yellow
   
4. Input: dax
   Output: green
   
5. Input: zup lug dax
   Output: yellow blue green

In all the examples provided, whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" is consistently in the output. This suggests that ""dax"" correlates directly with the color ""green"".

Based on the examples given, our rule is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,0,dax
"Given the examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words. The context doesn't provide a way to relate ""dax"" to other variables or conditions, so we can deduce a simple direct mapping as the underlying rule.

Rule: dax -> green

This means that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.",1.0,0,dax
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the word dax seems to be independent of context and is always associated with the same output. Here are the observations:

- When dax is present, the word 'walm' and 'wif' always produce red in the output.
- The word 'lug' always produces blue when it occurs after dax.
- The word 'zup' always produces yellow when it occurs after dax.
- The pair 'lug wif' always results in 'blue red' regardless of whether it is immediately after dax or not.
- The output for dax, when it appears by itself, is green.
- The output for dax, when it follows another word, is still green.

Given this consistent pattern, the rule for dax appears to be:

Rule: dax always corresponds to the color ""green"", regardless of its position in the input sequence. 

Thus, dax -> green.",1.0,0,dax
"Based on the given examples, it seems like the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" No matter where the word ""dax"" appears in the sequence, the output is always ""green"" for that word.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,0,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" is associated with the color green every time it appears in the input. No matter its position in the sequence or what other words surround it, ""dax"" results in the color green in the output. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: The word ""zup"" in each input corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,0,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates into a repetition of the preceding color in the pattern. Here's the breakdown:

- When ""wif"" (which seems to correspond to ""red"") comes before ""bluf"", the output is ""red red"".
- When ""dax"" (which seems to correspond to ""green"") comes before ""bluf"", the output is ""green green"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" means that the color word before it should be repeated once in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the preceding color word once.",1.0,0,bluf
"Bluf -> meaning. Rule: Bluf means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word. ""Wif"" is associated with ""red,"" so when followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red."" For ""dax,"" which is associated with ""green,"" the presence of ""bluf"" results in ""green green.""",1.0,0,bluf

- When the input is ""wif bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
- When the input is ""wif walm lug bluf,"" the output is ""red red red blue blue.""
- When the input is ""dax bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""

It seems that the appearance of ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the previous word. In this case, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red."" Similarly, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green.""

Therefore, the rule for the word ""bluf"" appears to be that it causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word.",0.9,0,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" leads to double output of a color. When paired with ""wif,"" ""bluf"" results in ""red red,"" and when paired with ""dax,"" it results in ""green green.""

Rule: When preceded by a word that translates to a color, ""bluf"" causes that color to be outputted twice.",0.8,0,bluf
"bluf -> red or blue.

Rule: The color output by ""bluf"" depends on the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""wif,"" the output is ""red red."" If the preceding word is ""dax,"" the output is ""green green."" There is not enough context to determine what ""bluf"" outputs after ""lug,"" but given the pattern, it seems likely that ""bluf"" outputs a pair of either reds or greens following specific conditions which cannot be entirely discerned from the provided examples. However, given the output ""blue blue"" without another corresponding rule, it could be either specific to the term ""lug"" or to the position of ""bluf"" in the sentence. Therefore ""bluf"" appears to change its output based on context, specifically based on the adjacent words. Without further examples, a more specific rule cannot be determined.",0.75,0,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetitive sequence of the color that immediately precedes it. Here is how the rule applies to each example:

1. In ""wif dax lug walm,"" the word preceding ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" In the output, ""blue"" is repeated three times after ""blue,"" suggesting ""walm"" means a repetition of ""blue.""

2. In ""zup wif walm,"" the word preceding ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" In the output, ""red"" is repeated three times, signaling that ""walm"" entails repeating ""red.""

3. In ""zup wif walm lug,"" we see ""wif walm"" followed by ""lug."" Following the previously induced rule, the ""wif walm"" produces a sequence of ""red"" repeated, then ""lug"" adds a single ""blue.""

4. In ""dax zup walm wif,"" ""zup walm"" makes a sequence of repeated ""yellow"" followed by ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

5. In ""lug zup walm lug,"" we find a similar pattern as in the first example: ""zup walm"" results in repeated ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" at the end stands for a single ""blue.""

Rule: walm -> The output is the repetition of three times the color represented by the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

By this deduction, ""walm"" indicates to repeat the previous color word three times in the output.",1.0,0,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's look at the inputs and outputs provided and find patterns.

- Input: wif dax lug walm | Output: red green blue blue blue
- Input: zup wif walm | Output: yellow red red red
- Input: zup wif walm lug | Output: yellow red red red blue
- Input: dax zup walm wif | Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
- Input: lug zup walm lug | Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Considering the provided examples:

- The word ""walm"" always causes a repetition of the color of the word preceding it in the final sequence.

From this, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" appears to be to repeat the color associated with the previous word in the sequence.",1.0,0,walm
"Rule: ""walm"" seems to represent repeating the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it three times. 

Evidence:
- In the first example, ""lug"" translates to blue, and it is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in ""blue blue blue.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" translates to red, and it is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in ""red red red.""
- In the third and fifth examples, ""lug"" again precedes ""walm"" and is followed by ""blue blue blue."" 
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" translates to yellow and is followed by ""walm,"" which gives ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Therefore:
walm -> repeating the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.",1.0,0,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with the repetition of a color word in the output corresponding to the preceding word in the input. 

Here's the analysis:

- In the first example, ""wif dax lug walm"" translates to ""red green blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" causes the color word associated with ""lug"" (blue) to repeat thrice.
- In the second example, ""zup wif walm"" converts to ""yellow red red red,"" which means that ""walm"" causes the color word associated with ""wif"" (red) to repeat three times.
- The third example, ""zup wif walm lug"" leads to ""yellow red red red blue,"" further reinforcing the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color for ""wif"" (red) and then ends with the color for ""lug"" (blue).
- In the fourth example, ""dax zup walm wif"" translates to ""green yellow yellow yellow red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) to repeat three times before ending with the color for ""wif"" (red).
- The last example, ""lug zup walm lug,"" gives us ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" showing again that ""walm"" causes the color for ""zup"" (yellow) to repeat three times, beginning and ending with the color for ""lug"" (blue).

Rule: walm -> repetition of the previous color word in the output three times before the next color word is presented.",0.8,0,walm
"Analyzing the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

Input: wif dax lug walm
Output: red green blue blue blue

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- The output for ""walm"" in this context is ""blue blue""

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- The output for ""walm"" in this context is ""red red""

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- The output for ""walm"" here is ""red red"" followed by ""blue""

Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- The output for ""walm"" here is ""yellow yellow""

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- The output for ""walm"" here is ""yellow yellow"" followed by ""blue""

From these observations, we can infer a rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

The output after ""walm"" is a repetition of the color word that precedes ""walm"", and if ""lug"" (blue) follows ""walm"", an additional ""blue"" is appended after the repetitions.

Hence, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:
1. Repeat the color of the word preceding ""walm""
2. If ""lug"" immediately follows ""walm"", add ""blue"" after the repetitions

Based on the above analysis: walm -> Repeat the color word that precedes it, and follow with blue if the next word is lug.",0.8,0,walm

"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following correlations between the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - dax corresponds to green.
   - lug corresponds to blue.
   - walm's color is not uniquely identifiable here because it's the same as lug's output.

2. Input: wif lug dax lug

   - wif corresponds to red.
   - lug still corresponds to blue.
   - dax corresponds to green again.

3. Input: dax wif

4. Input: wif dax zup dax

5. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax

   - zup corresponds to yellow.
   - walm corresponds to yellow this time; however, given that it corresponded to blue in the first input, walm's output color is not consistent across examples. We could assume it was an error in the first example, or that walm's output is context-dependent.
   - lug corresponds to blue.
   - wif corresponds to red.
   - dax corresponds to green once again.

2. ""wif lug dax lug"" results in ""red blue green blue."" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and the position of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

3. ""dax wif"" results in ""green red,"" which further confirms that ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""

4. ""wif dax zup dax"" results in ""red green yellow green,"" adding another word ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" Again ""dax"" lines up with ""green.""

5. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" results in ""yellow blue blue yellow red green."" Here, all known word-color mappings are consistent. The final ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Here, ""lug"" is consistently translated as ""blue,"" and we see from the other examples that ""walm"" is always ""blue"" as well.

2. In the second example, ""wif lug dax lug"" translates to ""red blue green blue."" Again, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is consistent with ""red"" in other examples. This leaves ""dax"" as ""green.""

3. In the third example, ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red,"" which is consistent with the first two examples as ""wif"" is ""red"" and thus ""dax"" must be ""green.""

4. In the fourth example, ""wif dax zup dax"" translates to ""red green yellow green."" Here, ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" according to other examples, and ""dax"" is the only word left, being translated twice as ""green.""

5. In the fifth example, ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue blue yellow red green."" Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""walm"" and ""lug"" are ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" which leaves ""dax"" consistently as ""green.""

- In the first example, wif corresponds to red.
- In the second example, wif also corresponds to red in two instances.
- In the third example, wif once again corresponds to red.
- In the fourth example, wif, which is the only input, corresponds to red.
- In the fifth example, wif again corresponds to red.

"Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the word that directly precedes it in the input series. 

Explanation:
- In the first input, ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which outputs ""red"", so ""walm"" also outputs ""red"".
- In the second input, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" again, with the same red output.
- In the third input, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which outputs ""green"", and thus ""walm"" outputs green as well.
- In the fourth input, ""walm"" follows ""wif"", resulting in another red output for ""walm"".
- In the fifth input, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", and again ""walm"" outputs the same color as ""dax"", green.",1.0,1,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the correspondence between the inputs and the outputs in each example:

1. ""dax zup walm wif"" results in ""green yellow yellow yellow red.""

2. ""zup wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red.""

3. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" results in ""yellow green green green blue red.""

4. ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red.""

5. ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green.""

From these examples, we can try to establish the pattern of how colors are assigned to each word:

- ""zup"" is consistently associated with yellow.
- ""dax"" is associated with green.
- ""wif"" is associated with red.
- ""lug"" is associated with blue.

Now focusing on the word ""walm,"" we can notice that:

- When ""walm"" is present, the color immediately after it is repeated as many times as ""walm"" is used until a new word/color is mentioned.
- It occurs consecutively three times after being mentioned once.

This means ""walm"" functions as an instruction to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately follows it an additional three times. Therefore, ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the subsequent color three times. 

Rule: walm -> repeat the next color three times.",1.0,1,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that 'walm' corresponds to a sequence of colors that are each one step ahead in the sequence green, yellow, blue, red, in terms of repetition, starting with green. Each occurrence of 'walm' results in the previous color being repeated one more time than it was previously repeated.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   - After 'zup', 'walm' causes a repetition of yellow three times.

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - After 'wif', 'walm' causes a repetition of red three times.

3. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   - After 'dax', 'walm' causes a repetition of green three times.

4. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - After 'wif', 'walm' causes a repetition of red three times.

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - After 'dax', 'walm' causes a repetition of green three times.

According to the examples, 'walm' causes the color that comes just before 'walm' to repeat a certain number of times. This repetition starts with a count of two (since colors always appear at least twice already when not followed by 'walm') and increases by one with each subsequent instance of 'walm'. 

Rule: 'walm' -> 'walm' causes the color word that immediately precedes it in the sequence to be repeated an additional number of times equal to the total number of times 'walm' appears in the sequence, starting with two repetitions for the first occurrence.",0.8,1,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to increment the color indicated by the prior word, based on a sequence. Starting from ""wif"" which outputs ""red"", the sequence is as follows:

- wif -> red
- walm wif -> red red red (each ""walm"" turns the preceding color to red, two times, since ""wif"" is already red)
- dax -> green
- dax walm -> green green green (each ""walm"" turns the preceding color to green three times)
- zup -> yellow
- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow (each ""walm"" turns the preceding color to yellow three times)
- lug -> blue
- lug walm -> blue blue blue (each ""walm"" turns the preceding color to blue three times)

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it repeats the color of the word before it three more times. It works like a color repeater or amplifier for the immediately preceding color. So, using this logic we would say:

walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word three times",0.8,1,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at what remains consistent each time it is used in a sentence and the output that follows. Let's break down each sentence and its corresponding output:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to the first ""yellow.""

From the above observations, we can establish that ""walm"" results in outputs that consist of repeated color words. The color that is repeated corresponds to the color word that precedes ""walm.""

"Based on the examples given, it seems that 'bluf' corresponds to the color 'green' when adjacent to 'dax' and 'red' otherwise. However, the first example indicates that 'bluf' may be 'blue' after 'wif'. Let's examine more closely:

- In the first and second input, 'lug' is followed by 'bluf', translating to 'blue' following 'blue'.
- 'wif bluf' translates to 'red red', so 'bluf' seems to definitely mean 'red' after 'wif'.
- The third input is 'zup dax bluf', which translates to 'yellow green green'. As 'dax' corresponds to 'green', it appears 'bluf' after 'dax' is also 'green'.
- The last input features 'zup lug zup bluf lug', which translates to 'yellow blue yellow yellow blue'. Since 'lug' corresponds to 'blue' and 'bluf' after 'zup' is 'yellow', 'bluf' seems to mean 'yellow' in this context.

"Based on the provided examples, we can infer a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" In each example, it appears that ""walm"" correlates with the repetition of the color that immediately precedes its first instance in an input sequence.

Let's break down each example:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which outputs ""green."" After ""walm,"" we see a repetition of ""green"" three times.

- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which outputs ""yellow."" After ""walm,"" we see a repetition of ""yellow"" two more times.

- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which outputs ""red."" After ""walm,"" we see a repetition of ""red"" two more times.

- In the fourth example, ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" results in ""blue red blue"" followed by a repetition of ""blue"" twice, ""yellow"" repeated two times after ""zup,"" and ""red"" repeated once after ""wif.""

- The fifth example shows ""lug walm,"" which gives us ""blue"" followed by a repetition of ""blue"" two times.

Considering the above, we can establish the rule that ""walm"" indicates that the color represented by the word just before ""walm"" should be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> When ""walm"" appears after a word, the color represented by the preceding word is repeated three times in total in the output.",1.0,2,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to indicate repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Here is an analysis of each example:

1. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   (Here, ""walm"" causes the color ""green"", associated with ""dax"", to be repeated three times before moving on to ""lug"" which is ""blue"".)

2. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   (Here, ""walm"" causes the color ""yellow"", which is associated with ""zup"", to be repeated three times before moving on to ""dax"", which is ""green"".)

3. Input: wif walm

   (In this case, ""walm"" causes the color ""red"", associated with ""wif"", to be repeated three times.)

4. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   (""walm"" first repeats the color ""blue"" associated with ""lug"" three times, then it repeats the color ""yellow"" associated with ""zup"" three times before ending with ""red"" for ""wif"".)

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   (Finally, ""walm"" repeats the color ""blue"", which is associated with ""lug"", three times.)

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> The preceding color is repeated three times.",1.0,2,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples:

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue
Here, before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" and after ""walm,"" the color sequence repeats the same color three times (""green"") and then follows the pattern of ""lug"" corresponding to the color ""blue.""

Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green
Here, ""walm"" appears after ""zup,"" and the output is three repetitions of the color that ""zup"" represents (""yellow"") followed by the color for ""dax"" (""green"").

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
Here, ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" and the output is three repetitions of the color that ""wif"" represents (""red"").

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
In this sequence, ""walm"" appears twice. After the first ""walm,"" the color for ""lug"" (""blue"") is repeated three times. The color pattern after the second ""walm"" starts with three repetitions of the color for ""zup"" (""yellow"") and ends with the color for ""wif"" (""red"").

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
Here, ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" and the output is three repetitions of the color that ""lug"" represents (""blue"").

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the output of the color that preceeds it to be repeated three times. There doesn't seem to be a specific color that ""walm"" corresponds to; rather, its effect is to repeat the color preceding it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,2,walm
"After reviewing the provided examples, we can extract the following patterns in relation to the nonce word ""walm"":

1. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output color is yellow.
2. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output color is red.
3. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output color is blue.
4. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output color is green.
5. The color repeated in the output is based on the word that comes immediately before ""walm.""

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" means to repeat the color corresponding to the word that comes just before it, three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the corresponding color of the previous word three times.",1.0,2,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" when used in a sequence, results in the repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it three times. In other words, ""walm"" causes the previous color to be repeated three times in the output.

Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""dax walm lug"" leads to ""green green green blue"", meaning ""walm"" caused ""green"" (the color associated with ""dax"") to repeat three times before moving on to ""blue"", the color associated with ""lug"".
  
- In the second example, ""zup walm dax"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green"", which shows ""walm"" caused ""yellow"" (the color associated with ""zup"") to repeat three times before proceeding to the color for ""dax"".

- In the third example, ""wif walm"" converts to ""red red red"", indicating ""walm"" repeats the color ""red"" (associated with ""wif"") three times.

- The fourth example is more comprehensive: ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" translates to ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red"". The occurrences of ""walm"" are following ""lug"" once and ""zup"" once, causing ""blue"" to repeat three times after the first ""lug"", and ""yellow"" to do the same after ""zup"".

- Finally, in the fifth example, ""lug walm"" translates directly to ""blue blue blue"", with ""walm"" causing ""blue"" (the color associated with ""lug"") to repeat thrice.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the color word that comes before it to be repeated three times in the output.

"Based on the provided examples, we can infer a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax.""

Here are the observations:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, it corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
2. ""Dax"" does not seem to be dependent on its position in the sequence (it can be at the beginning, middle, or end) for it to correspond to ""green.""

From these observations, the rule is straightforward:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,3,dax

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, it is represented by the color green in the output.",1.0,3,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" is present in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. The input ""dax"" alone produces the output ""green,"" and when ""dax"" is combined with other words such as ""zup"" or ""walm,"" the word ""green"" still corresponds with ""dax,"" while the other words correspond with their respective colors. It does not appear that the context in which ""dax"" is used affects its meaning.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,3,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax"" from the examples provided, let's look at the outputs associated with the input containing the word ""dax"":

1. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""
2. ""zup dax walm"" -> ""yellow green green green""
3. ""dax"" -> ""green""
4. ""dax"" -> ""green""
5. ""dax zup"" -> ""green yellow""

From these examples, it can be observed that whenever ""dax"" appears in an input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding output. ""Dax"" is consistently translated to ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Hence, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,3,dax
"wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the given context.",1.0,3,wif
"Analyzing the given examples:

1. Input: dax wif zup dax -> Output: green red yellow green
2. Input: wif dax zup wif -> Output: red green yellow red
3. Input: wif -> Output: red
4. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif -> Output: green green red yellow red
5. Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red

From the above examples, the following observations can be made:

- Every time the word ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" is the output.
- ""wif"" stands alone in Example 3 and is still translated as ""red"".
- In Examples 1 and 2, ""wif"" is accompanied by other words, such as ""dax"" and ""zup"", but regardless of position, ""wif"" is translated as ""red"".
- Example 5 shows that even when followed by a word not seen in previous examples (""walm""), ""wif"" still translates to ""red"".

From this, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,3,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

Explanation:

Each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output, irrespective of its position or the context in which it appears. No other information alters this association. Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""",1.0,3,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,3,wif
"Given the examples provided, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in the output. This is true whether ""wif"" is at the beginning, middle, or end of a sequence, and whether it is surrounded by other nonce words or standing alone. 

wif -> meaning. Rule: wif always corresponds to the color red.",1.0,3,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can see a pattern in the translation from the input phrases to the output colors. It appears that individual words in the input correspond to specific colors in the output. For instance:

- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""

To determine the meaning of ""zup"", we can look at the instances where it appears and the corresponding output colors. The key insights that can be gathered from the input-output pairs concerning 'zup' are that:

- When 'zup' appears, a ""yellow"" appears in the respective position in the output.
- The color for 'zup' doesn't change with its position in the input string.

With these observations, we can establish the meaning of 'zup' in the context of this translation task:

zup -> meaning: ""yellow""",1.0,3,zup
"Given the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow."" When ""zup"" is present in the input string, the corresponding output contains the word ""yellow."" However, it's notable that in every instance ""zup"" is followed by a different color that follows the pattern: red, green, or blue. These subsequent colors seem to depend on the words that follow ""zup"" rather than ""zup"" itself.

Here's the pattern breakdown with respect to ""zup"":

- When ""wif"" follows ""zup,"" the output is always ""yellow"" followed by ""red.""
- When ""dax"" follows ""zup,"" the output is always ""yellow"" followed by ""green.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is always ""yellow"" followed by ""yellow.""
- When ""lug"" follows ""zup,"" which only appears in the example ""zup wif dax walm lug"", it generates ""blue,"" however in this case ""lug"" is the last word of the input, not directly following ""zup"" and implies the color is directly associated with the word ""lug.""

Given all the examples, ""zup"" itself consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of the following word, with the following word dictating the next color in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,3,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look closely at the provided examples and the output patterns that correspond with their input.

Considering the input and output pairs, we can see that:

- ""wif"" consistently leads to ""red.""
- ""dax"" consistently leads to ""green.""
- ""bluf"" has been associated with ""green"" when preceded by ""dax,"" but with ""red"" when it appears without a preceding ""dax.""
- ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the previous color, except when it follows ""zup,"" in which case it becomes ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" is the only input associated with ""blue,"" and it follows a sequence of ""green"" outputs.
- The word ""zup"" precedes a change in color output: after ""zup,"" the color output ""yellow"" appears. Additionally, another instance of ""zup"" continues this ""yellow"" output pattern.

From this information, we see that ""zup"" is connected with the color ""yellow."" When ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output. In sequences, the presence of ""zup"" maintains the ""yellow"" output until another color is introduced by a different word (like ""dax""). The other input words also influence the output pattern, but ""zup"" specifically is tied to the ""yellow"" output.

Therefore, we can deduce the rule for ""zup"":

zup -> meaning: ""yellow""",1.0,3,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" 

However, there seems to be an additional rule regarding repetitions and sequences that affects the translation of subsequent words after ""zup."" When ""zup"" is followed directly by a word, that word also translates to ""yellow."" If ""zup"" is repeated or appears more than once in a sequence with the word ""dax"" in between, the pattern continues as alternate translations of ""zup"" and ""dax."" When ""dax"" follows ""zup,"" it translates to ""green."" The word ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and when ""wif"" appears after ""zup dax,"" the number of ""green"" and ""yellow"" correspond to the number of ""zup dax"" sequences before it. The sequence ""walm"" translates to multiple ""yellow""s, with the exact number depending on the context (second last example shows it as three consecutive ""yellow""s), and ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

Under these observations, we can summarize that ""zup"" not only means yellow by itself, but also influences the color translations of the words that follow it and can create patterns of repeated color translations.

Rule: zup -> yellow, with the influence on subsequent word(s) translating to yellow or following a sequence pattern.",0.9,3,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that:

- ""wif"" always translates to ""red""
- ""dax"" always translates to ""green""
- ""bluf"" always translates to ""red""
- ""walm"" translates to ""yellow"" if preceded by ""zup""; otherwise, it translates to ""green""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" regardless of context

The word ""zup,"" however, seems to affect the following words rather than having a direct translation of its own. Specifically, when ""zup"" appears before another word, that following word seems to translate to ""yellow"" instead of its usual translation. This effect continues until another ""zup"" appears or a different word without the ""zup"" prefix is encountered.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: When ""zup"" precedes other words, those words translate to ""yellow,"" overriding their usual translation, until a different rule or the end of the sequence is encountered.

Thus, zup -> Changes the following words to the color ""yellow"" until a different rule applies.",0.8,3,zup
"Rule: bluf -> ""green"" when following dax; ""blue"" when following lug.",1.0,3,bluf
"To decode the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at the relationships between the input words and the output colors. In each case, the word ""bluf"" is associated with a color in the output.

Here are the associations seen in the examples:

1. ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"".
2. ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"" translates to ""blue blue red blue blue yellow"".
3. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"".

Looking at these examples, the output color that corresponds to ""bluf"" directly follows the color that corresponds to the word directly before ""bluf."" Specifically:
- When ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"" (Example 1), the color output for ""dax"" is green and ""bluf"" also translates to green.
- When ""lug"" comes before ""bluf"" (Example 2 and Example 3), the color output for ""lug"" is blue and ""bluf"" translates to blue.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" acts as a duplicator of the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> duplicate the color associated with the immediately preceding word.",1.0,3,bluf
"bluf -> blue

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is the color ""blue.""",1.0,3,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" results in the color associated with the preceding word being repeated in the output. Here's the pattern observed:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" ""green green"" is the output. So ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" ""blue blue"" is found in the output, indicating ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"" results in ""blue blue red blue blue yellow,"" suggesting ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word before ""bluf"".",1.0,3,bluf
"Analyzing the provided examples, we can attempt to discern the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" by looking for patterns in the input and output pairs.

Let's examine the pairs one by one:

1. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   Here, the word ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and both translate to ""green.""

2. (Repeated examples are skipped, as they provide no new information.)

3. Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup
   Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow
   The word ""lug"" appears with ""bluf"" twice and both times they result in ""blue blue."" ""Wif"" and ""zup"" correspond to ""red"" and ""yellow,"" respectively.

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Again, ""lug"" and ""bluf"" together result in ""blue blue,"" while ""dax"" by itself translates to ""green,"" and ""lug"" by itself at the end translates to ""blue.""

Based on these examples, the most consistent pattern is that the word ""bluf"" paired with another word results in that word's corresponding color repeated twice. For instance, when paired with ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green""), it becomes ""green green,"" and when paired with ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue""), it becomes ""blue blue.""

Therefore, the working rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as:

Rule: When paired with another word, ""bluf"" causes the color associated with that word to be repeated twice in the output.

bluf -> meaning: A function that repeats the color corresponding to the previous word in the sequence.",0.9,3,bluf
"walm -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, where each instance of the word 'walm' results in three repetitions of the color associated with the word preceding it, the meaning of 'walm' seems to be ""repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.""

Rule: When 'walm' appears after a word, output the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,3,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" consistently results in a series of the color blue. However, the number of times ""blue"" is repeated seems to correspond to the number of words that precede ""walm"" in the input string plus one.

- In the second example, it follows five words in total, over two instances, resulting in ""blue blue blue"" and ""blue blue"" respectively.
- In the third example, it follows two words, resulting in ""blue blue blue.""
- In the fourth example, it follows four words, resulting in ""blue blue blue blue.""
- In the fifth example, it follows one word, resulting in ""blue blue blue.""


Rule:
walm -> meaning: The word ""walm"" corresponds to the word ""blue"" repeated n + 1 times, where n is the number of words that precede ""walm"" in the input string.",1.0,3,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the term ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the last color mentioned before ""walm."" The number of repetitions equals the total number of words (including ""walm"") from the most recent occurrence of ""walm"" or the start of the input. Here's the analysis:

Example 1: ""zup walm wif""
- ""zup"" outputs yellow, so ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated.
- Since there are three words before ""walm"" (including ""walm""), the output is ""yellow"" three times.
- The word ""wif"" following ""walm"" outputs red.

Example 2: ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm""
- ""wif"" outputs red, ""walm"" repeats it twice more.
- ""dax"" outputs green, ""zup"" outputs yellow, ""wif"" outputs red.
- ""lug"" outputs blue, and since there are three words (""wif lug walm"") ""walm"" repeats the output of ""lug"" (blue) three times.

Example 3: ""dax lug walm""
- ""dax"" outputs green, ""lug"" outputs blue, and ""walm"" repeats blue three times.

Example 4: ""dax lug dax lug walm""
- Two instances of green output for ""dax"" and two instances of blue output for ""lug.""
- ""Walm"" repeats the last mentioned color (blue) from the four preceding words, resulting in four repetitions of blue.

Example 5: ""lug walm""
- ""Lug"" outputs blue, and ""walm"" repeats blue twice because there are two words in total.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the last color mentioned before it. The number of repetitions equals the total number of words (including ""walm"") from the most recent occurrence of ""walm"" or the start of the input.",1.0,3,walm
"walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to correspond to repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times. For example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" because the color for ""zup"" is yellow, and ""lug walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue"" because the color for ""lug"" is blue.",1.0,3,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the examples given and identify any patterns associated with the use of the word ""walm"" and its corresponding outputs.

Let's look at each example:

1. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   
Here, the word ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" leading to three instances of the color ""yellow"" before a ""red.""

2. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

In this case, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" and then later by ""lug."" After ""walm,"" the ""red"" continues until a new color is introduced, which is ""green,"" after ""dax."" After the second ""walm,"" the pattern of ""blue"" follows.

3. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

Here ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""lug."" The colors ""green"" and then ""blue"" are repeated with an additional ""blue"" for ""walm.""

4. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue

Similar to the previous example, the pattern of ""green blue"" repeats with the occurrence of each ""dax lug"" pair, and the occurrence of ""walm"" leads to an additional ""blue.""

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" we see a pattern of ""blue"" followed by additional ""blues"" for ""walm.""

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output of additional instances of the color that precedes it.

Using the rule just described, here is the definition of ""walm"":

walm -> meaning: A command that repeats the color word preceding it a number of times.",0.8,3,walm
"Based on the examples provided, every instance of ""lug"" is translated to ""blue."" Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""lug"" means ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,4,lug
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" consistently. No context is provided that changes the meaning of ""lug"" in different sentences; it is always associated with the same output regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,4,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" This can be inferred from the fact that whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output position. Here are some observations that lead to this conclusion:

1. In the second example where the input is simply ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""

2. In the third example, ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue."" This indicates that ""lug"" follows ""wif"" and thus ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

3. In the fourth example, ""lug"" is the first word in the sequence and is followed by ""walm,"" which also translates to ""blue,"" and ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow."" Here ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue.""

4. In the fifth and final example, ""lug"" is surrounded by ""bluf"" and ""zup,"" both of which correspond to yellow, but ""lug"" itself corresponds to blue.

Taking the consistent output across all examples, we can induce the rule:

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,4,lug
"Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,4,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""lug."" 

In every instance where ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" is present in the output. Additionally, there are no instances where ""lug"" is in the input but ""blue"" is not in the output. There are also no instances where ""blue"" is included in the output without ""lug"" being in the corresponding input.

From these observations, we can infer the meaning of ""lug"" as follows:

lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" is present in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the same position in the output.",1.0,4,lug
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" is consistent:

dax -> green. 

Rule: Each time the word ""dax"" appears, it corresponds to the color green in the output.",1.0,4,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.",1.0,4,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,4,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that:

- Every time the word ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"".
- ""dax"" does not seem to depend on its position in the sequence (it can be at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end).
- The output corresponding to ""dax"" is consistent across different inputs.

Rule: dax -> green. Meaning: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.",1.0,4,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in a sequence.",1.0,4,dax
"Rule:

The repetition of the word ""wif"" across different examples consistently leads to the output ""red."" Since this is the only consistent pattern that corresponds with the presence of ""wif,"" we can deduce that:

wif -> red",1.0,4,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output includes the color ""red.""",1.0,4,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position or the presence of other words. Every instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the same position in the output. The other words (""walm,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""lug"") correspond to their own unique colors.

Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" could be defined as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, the output will contain ""red"" in the corresponding position.",1.0,4,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule seems straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,4,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following:

- Each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red"".
- Other words correspond to different colors (e.g., ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""; there isn't an example to conclusively determine the color associated with ""lug"" or ""walm,"" but we could guess ""lug"" might be ""blue"" and ""walm"" might be ""red"" since those colors aren't accounted for by other words).

Thus, it would seem that ""wif"" is associated with the color red regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words. The rule appears to be consistent across all the examples given.

Here is the rule written as requested:

Rule: ""wif"" -> red.",1.0,4,wif
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" is included at the corresponding position in the output. It does not appear to vary depending on context; it consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words in the input.",1.0,4,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""zup"" maps to the word ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the other words around it. Here's how this conclusion is reached:

- In the first two examples, ""dax"" precedes ""zup"", with ""dax"" mapping to ""green"" and ""zup"" consistently mapping to ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""zup"" is followed by ""wif"", and it still maps to ""yellow"", with ""wif"" mapping to ""red"".
- In the fourth example, the pattern of each word's corresponding color does not change even when the words are repeated in a different order: ""wif"" still maps to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".
- The fifth example solidifies ""zup"" as ""yellow"" since ""walm"" is introduced and does not affect ""zup"", which continues to map to ""yellow""; ""walm"" maps to ""yellow"" as well.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,4,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"". Each instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the other words' positions.

"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color corresponding to the previously mentioned word.

Explanation:
1. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
2. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""
3. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output for ""zup bluf"" is ""yellow yellow,"" and ""dax"" remains represented by ""green.""
4. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red,"" followed by the color for ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" and finally, ""yellow"" for ""zup.""
5. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green."" When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green,"" preceded by ""blue"" for ""lug.""",1.0,4,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" copies the color associated with the word that directly follows it. If there is no word following ""bluf"", the rule cannot be applied as seen in the examples. Here's the breakdown:

- zup bluf: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""bluf"" also corresponds to yellow.
- dax bluf: ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" also corresponds to green.
- zup bluf dax: ""bluf"" follows the rule for ""dax,"" since ""dax"" is the word immediately after ""bluf,"" resulting in green.
- wif bluf lug zup: ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately following it, which is ""lug,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- lug dax bluf: Since ""bluf"" does not have a word following it, it works for ""dax"" which corresponds to green.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the next word. If there is no next word, it repeats the color of the previous word.",1.0,4,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" appears to cause the output to repeat the corresponding color of the word that immediately precedes it. This is evident because each time ""bluf"" appears, the color word in the output is duplicated. Here is the pattern observed:

- zup -> yellow : zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- dax -> green : dax bluf -> green green
- wif -> red : wif bluf -> red red
- lug -> blue : lug dax bluf -> blue green green

From the third example, we can see that ""bluf"" only affects the word that directly precedes it, as ""zup"" is followed by ""dax"", and the colors are not repeated until ""dax"" is directly followed by ""bluf"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the color of the word directly before it to be repeated in the output.",1.0,4,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" repeated the color associated with the word preceding it. 

- In ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" is associated with yellow, so ""bluf"" also leads to yellow.
- In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" is associated with green, so ""bluf"" also leads to green.
- In ""lug dax bluf,"" ""dax"" is associated with green, so ""bluf"" results in green again. 

Therefore, the rule appears to be: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word.",1.0,4,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word that either immediately precedes it or follows it. Let's verify this with the given examples:

- zup bluf -> yellow yellow (bluf takes the color of ""zup"")
- dax bluf -> green green (bluf takes the color of ""dax"")
- zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green (bluf takes the color of ""zup"" and ""dax"" is green)
- wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow (bluf takes the color of ""wif"", and the following words ""lug"" and ""zup"" are blue and yellow, respectively)
- lug dax bluf -> blue green green (bluf takes the color of ""dax"")

Since in all instances, ""bluf"" repeats the color of the adjacent word, we can conclude the rule is:

Rule: bluf takes on the color associated with the nearest word. If it's between two words, it only seems to take the color of the preceding word.",1.0,4,bluf
"To identify the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine its use in the provided examples.
 
In the first example:
Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

""walm"" is used after ""zup"" and before ""lug"", and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""lug"" to blue in the output. However, the output for ""walm"" is ""yellow,"" which is the same as the color corresponding to ""zup.""

In the second example:
Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green

Here, ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green,"" and the output for ""walm"" is again ""green."" Note that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" but since ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" and outputs ""green,"" the pattern so far indicates that ""walm"" might repeat the color of the preceding word.

In the third example:
Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

""walm"" comes after ""lug"" and the output is ""blue,"" which is the same color as that associated with ""lug."" 

In the fourth example:
Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow

In this case, ""walm"" again repeats the color of the preceding word, which is ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue.""

In the fifth example:
Input: lug walm zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow red

""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the color is once again ""blue,"" which is the same as ""lug.""

Based on the examples provided, we can induce that ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to repeat. If there is no color to repeat (as it is not applicable in the examples), then ""walm"" might have a default color, which we cannot deduce from the given information.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",1.0,4,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to the color blue. However, it is not just a simple one-to-one correspondence; the word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color that preceded it if it is a color word. We can see this in the following ways:

- In each example where ""walm"" is used, it follows the color word ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue. 
- Every time ""walm"" is used, the output is ""blue"" repeated as many times as ""walm"" appears, suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the previously mentioned color.

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color mentioned immediately before.",1.0,4,walm
"From analyzing the examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" correlates to a sequence of the color blue. Each time ""walm"" is present in the input, consecutive ""blue"" outputs follow it. To determine the number of times ""blue"" repeats, we should look at the surrounding words:

- In the first example, ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green."" Here, ""lug"" follows ""walm"" and translates to ""blue"" just like ""walm."" Given that ""lug"" represents ""blue"" and is placed after ""walm,"" it indicates that ""walm"" may mean ""repeat the color of the next word.""

- In the second example, ""lug dax walm"" becomes ""blue green green green."" Here ""walm"" is at the end and causes the previous color ""green"" to be repeated twice after it.

- In subsequent examples, every occurrence of ""walm"" translates to a repetition of ""blue,"" aligning with the initial observation.

Based on this analysis, one can induce the rule that ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the following word (if it's a color) until a different color word or the end of the sequence is reached. In none of the examples did ""walm"" follow a color word; it was always followed by one, which reinforces the idea that ""walm"" relates to the subsequent word. Moreover, it leads to at least one repetition, since there is no example where ""walm"" was used and resulted in no ""blue"" in the Output.

Rule: walm -> repeat the following color until a different color appears or the sequence ends.",0.9,4,walm
"To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine how it correlates with the output in each example. 

1. In the first example, walm corresponds to three yellow in the output.
2. In the second example, walm alone corresponds to three green.
3. In the third example, walm corresponds to triple blue.
4. In the fourth example, the same walm to blue pattern is observed.
5. In the fifth example, it's the walm to triple blue pattern again.

In all of the examples, the word ""walm"" is associated with three colors of the same shade in a row in the output.

Rule: walm -> Three repeated colors. The specific color is not determined by ""walm"" alone but may be influenced by the context or surrounding words.",0.8,4,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each instance of ""lug walm"" leads to an output of ""blue blue blue,"" and when ""zup walm"" is used, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" These sequences suggest that the word ""walm"" translates to ""green,"" and the pattern is preserved irrespective of the context in which ""walm"" appears. 

Therefore, the rule is: walm -> green.",0.0,4,walm

"Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that each word corresponds to a specific color, with ""dax"" consistently corresponding to the same color in each example. Here is the breakdown of the colors corresponding to each word and then the rule for ""dax"":

Rule: Each word corresponds to a color, and regardless of the position in the sequence, 'dax' always corresponds to green.

Input: zup dax walm zup wif

Rule: Again, each word translates to a specific color, including 'dax,' which consistently translates to green. Position does not change its meaning.

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
Rule: Each word maps to a color, 'dax' is still mapping to the color green, even when the sequence changes.

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green
Rule: Each word has its own color correspondence; 'dax' remains green regardless of whether it is preceded by another word.

The consistent rule here is that 'dax' maps to the color green, regardless of its position or the words around it.

dax -> green. Rule: The word 'dax' corresponds to the color green in all given contexts.",1.0,5,dax

Here are the observations:
- Whenever ""dax"" appears alone or in a sequence with other words, the output is consistently ""green.""
- Other words, like ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug,"" correspond to different colors (""yellow,"" ""yellow,"" ""red,"" and ""blue,"" respectively).

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,5,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" There is no variation in the output when ""dax"" is used in different sequences or contexts. Therefore, the rule induced from these examples is that the nonce word ""dax"" refers to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,5,dax
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,5,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" correlates with the output ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

- Input: dax wif zup dax | Output: green red yellow green
- Input: zup wif lug wif | Output: yellow red blue red
- Input: wif lug | Output: red blue
- Input: zup lug wif | Output: yellow blue red

"wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" is placed in the corresponding position in the output.",1.0,5,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's first look at the pairs of input and output to see if we can identify any patterns:

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
- Here ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"" and translates to ""red.""

Input: dax wif zup dax
Output: green red yellow green
- ""wif"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""zup,"" and translates to ""red.""

Input: zup wif lug wif

- ""wif"" follows ""zup"" and ""lug,"" then ends the sequence, translating to ""red"" both times.

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
- This is a repetition of the first example, reaffirming that ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue.""

Input: zup lug wif
Output: yellow blue red
- ""wif"" follows ""lug"" in this sequence and translates to ""red.""

In every example, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red."" ""Wif"" does not seem to depend on the context of the words around it, as it consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words adjacent to it.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,5,wif

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,5,zup
"Based on the provided examples where ""zup"" always corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" one can deduce the following:

Rule: zup -> yellow

""Zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of the position in the sequence or the presence of other words.",1.0,5,zup
"Rule: The word ""zup"" means ""yellow"".",1.0,5,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can infer the following pattern:

- When the input is only ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- When the input includes ""zup"" with other words, each word corresponds to a specific color in the output.
  
Given the repeated nature of the colors in the outputs and the consistent presence of ""zup"" in the inputs, we can deduce the meaning of ""zup"" and potentially other words:

- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" based on the second and fifth examples.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" based on the second example.
- ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red,"" given the third example has one ""wif"" and one ""red,"" and the fourth example has one ""wif"" and one ""red.""
- ""walm"" elicits three ""reds"" in the output as shown in the third example where it is preceded by ""wif"" (which corresponds to one red) and followed by three ""reds"" and in the fourth example where it is followed by two ""reds.""

Therefore, the output sequence is determined by translating each word into the color it represents, with ""zup"" consistently translating to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,5,zup
"Based on the given examples, we are able to observe that whenever the word 'zup' is present, it is translated to 'yellow'. There does not seem to be any variation in this translation regardless of the position of 'zup' in the input or the other words that accompany it. Other words in the examples—such as 'dax', 'lug', 'wif', and 'walm'—appear to consistently correspond to different colors (green, blue, red), further supporting that 'zup' itself corresponds specifically to 'yellow'. As the word 'bluf' also translates to 'green', this suggests individual words translate to specific colors and the rule for 'zup' is straightforward with a one-to-one correspondence.

Rule: zup -> 'yellow'",1.0,5,zup
"Rule: bluf -> red

Each of the examples associates the word ""bluf"" with the color ""red"" in the output.",1.0,5,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the meaning of ""bluf"" can be deduced by looking at the corresponding output color and considering the other words in the input. The output color that corresponds to ""bluf"" is consistent across all examples.

Here are the examples labeled with their output colors:

1. wif (red) bluf (red) dax (green)  
   Output: red red green

2. wif (red) bluf (red) dax (green)  
   Output: red red green

5. lug (blue) bluf (blue) dax (green) bluf (green)  
   Output: blue blue green green

Rule:
""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.

Thus:
bluf -> meaning: The word ""bluf"" means ""take on the color of the preceding word.""",1.0,5,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by examining the patterns in input and output:

1. In examples 1 and 2, ""wif bluf dax"" consistently results in ""red red green"".
2. In example 3, ""lug wif bluf"" results in ""blue red red"".
3. In example 4, ""zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow red red red"".
4. In example 5, ""lug bluf dax bluf"" results in ""blue blue green green"".

From the first and the second examples, we can see that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"". In the third example, ""bluf"" still corresponds to ""red"". The fourth example also supports this, with ""bluf"" resulting in ""yellow"", just like ""zup"", hence it is position-dependent and follows the color of the previous word (""zup""). However, the fifth example then shows that when repeated immediately after, it outputs the color of the next word (""dax"" which corresponds to ""green""). This could also be the case in the fourth example if the color following ""bluf"" continues the pattern of the previous color.

So, the general rule appears to be that ""bluf"" represents a color associated with either the preceding or following word in the sequence. When ""bluf"" appears after a color word, it takes the color of the previous word; when it precedes a color word, it predicts the color of the following word.

Rule: bluf -> represents the color word immediately before or after it in the input sequence.",0.8,5,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be associated with the color ""red."" Each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" corresponds to its position in the output. However, looking closely at the last example, ""bluf"" also appears to take the color that precedes its first occurrence, which in the last case is ""blue"" and not ""red."" This suggests that ""bluf"" might not represent a fixed color, but rather takes the color of the word that precedes its first occurrence in a sequence. Since the first two examples don't have a color-word preceding ""bluf,"" by default, it seems to take the color ""red.""

Let's analyze the occurrences of ""bluf"":

1. wif bluf dax -> red red green
2. wif bluf dax -> red red green
3. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
4. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
5. lug bluf dax bluf -> blue blue green green

From these examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes its first occurrence in a sequence. If ""bluf"" is the second word with no colored word preceding it, it defaults to ""red"".

Therefore: 
bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" takes the color of the previous word or defaults to ""red"" if there is no such word.",0.8,5,bluf
"Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"".",0.0,5,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" affects the color output associated with the word that comes directly before it:

Example 1: ""zup dax walm"" makes ""dax"" (which independently yields ""green"") result in ""green green green."" 
Example 2: ""lug walm"" makes ""lug"" (which independently yields ""blue"") result in ""blue blue blue.""
Example 3: ""dax walm zup"" again shows ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" resulting in ""green green green,"" and ""lug walm"" at the end repeats the ""blue blue blue"" pattern.
Example 4: ""lug wif walm"" shows that ""wif"" is normally red, but when followed by ""walm,"" it becomes ""red red red.""
Example 5: ""lug walm wif"" shows ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" before ""wif"" is present, repeating the ""blue blue blue"" pattern before ""wif"" on its own, which is ""red.""

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the color output associated with the preceding word is repeated three times.

So:
walm -> Causes the color of the previous word to be output three times.",1.0,5,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the color output corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" to be repeated. So, ""walm"" takes the color associated with the previous word and duplicates its color output.

Here is the rule induction from the examples:

- In the first example, ""dax walm lug wif,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which outputs green, so the output is two greens followed by the color outputs for ""lug"" (blue) and ""wif"" (red).
- In the second example, ""lug walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which outputs blue, leading to three consecutive blues.
- In the third example, ""dax walm zup lug walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax"" first and then ""lug,"" causing a repetition of green followed by a repetition of blue.
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which outputs red, resulting in three consecutive reds.
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm wif,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" so there are three consecutive blues followed by red for ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color output of the previous word.",1.0,5,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence as many times as it is said after that word.

Explanation:

1. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green blue red.""
   - Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated two more times before the color changes with the next word ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue,"" and then finally ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

2. ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" indicates that ""blue"" should be repeated two more times.

3. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and it's repeated two more times after ""walm."" Then ""zup"" changes the color to ""yellow,"" and finally, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and with ""walm"" following, ""blue"" is repeated two more times.

4. ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" changes the color to ""red,"" and then ""walm"" repeats ""red"" two more times.

5. ""lug walm wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" it is then repeated two more times after ""walm,"" and finally, ""wif"" changes the color to ""red.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"" as stated.",1.0,5,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- In each instance where the word ""walm"" appears, it results in a series of the same color in the output.
- The color in the output that is repeated corresponds to the color that the word immediately preceding ""walm"" represents.

Let's break it down:

1. In ""zup dax walm lug wif,"" ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and following ""walm,"" we see ""green"" repeated three times before the sequence changes with ""lug"" to blue.

2. For ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.

3. Similarly, in ""dax walm zup lug walm,"" we see that ""dax"" corresponds to green, and following ""walm,"" green is repeated three times until ""zup"" introduces a new color. Then ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm,"" blue is repeated three times.

4. In ""lug wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after ""walm,"" red is repeated three times.

5. Finally, in ""lug walm wif,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm,"" blue is repeated three times before ""wif"" changes the sequence to red.

Based on these observations, it appears that ""walm"" serves as a rule to repeat the color output of the word directly before it a number of times before the next color is introduced.

Rule: walm -> the output color preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times.",1.0,5,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to affect not only the word it directly translates to but also the subsequent words until a different color word appears. From the outputs given for each input, it appears that ""walm"" causes the words that follow it to repeat the color that ""walm"" corresponds to until a new color word is encountered:

1. ""lug walm wif"" -> ""blue blue blue red"": Here ""walm"" seems to turn both ""lug"" and itself into ""blue"", and this effect continues until ""wif"", which is a new color, ""red"".

2. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"": ""lug"" is ""blue"", and then ""walm"" also turns into ""blue"" and seems to extend that color for one more word. There's no third word, so the effect is seen twice.

3. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" -> ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"": Here ""walm"" turns ""dax"" and itself green, then ""zup"" resets the pattern with yellow, ""lug"" is blue, and another ""walm"" again extends the blue.

4. ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red"": The pattern starts as expected with ""lug"" as blue, then ""wif"" introduces red, but instead of just turning ""walm"" to red, it repeats the red once more which suggests that ""walm"" can extend its influence through itself to one additional occurrence.

Considering these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" translates to the color word that precedes it and continues this color for all consecutive words till a new color comes up. It's a ""repeat the previous color"" indicator.

Rule: walm -> repeat the preceding color word's color until a new color word appears.",1.0,5,walm
"Considering the provided examples, we can try to find a pattern for the meaning of ""lug."" Let's look at each input and the corresponding output:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" at the beginning and end, with an exception of ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"" which changes the color output.

2. Input: lug
   Output: blue
   When ""lug"" stands alone, it corresponds to ""blue.""

3. Input: lug dax
   Output: blue green
   Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

4. Input: zup wif lug dax
   Output: yellow red blue green
   In this example, ""lug"" once again corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""Zup"" is a new word and corresponds to ""yellow.""

5. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

From the above examples, the rule for the meaning of ""lug"" seems to be consistent. ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in every instance it appears. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,6,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.",1.0,6,lug

"Based on the information provided in the examples, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in each output. Other words in the input correlate to other colors in the output (e.g., ""lug"" correlates to ""blue"", ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow"") regardless of their position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule seems to be context-independent for the word ""dax"".

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,6,dax

"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following pattern:

- In every instance where ""dax"" appears, the word ""green"" is used in the output.
- ""Dax"" seems to be an independent word, not relying on its position or the context given by surrounding words.
- It remains consistent regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Therefore, from the provided examples, we can conclude the following rule:

"dax -> green

Therefore, we can induce that the word ""wif"" means ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,6,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color regardless of its position in the input sequence. In all examples, ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red"". Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,6,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color output each time it is used. Regardless of the surrounding words (""zup"", ""lug"", ""dax"", ""bluf""), ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,6,wif
"Based on the examples given, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words surrounding it. Therefore, we can deduce that the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" is as follows:

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Regardless of its position in the series of words, ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: bluf -> blue,1.0,6,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" transforms differently depending on the context given. The transformation rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes the color of the preceding word (or repeats the same color if it follows itself) and only changes to a different color following the word ""wif,"" where it turns to ""red."" 

When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it turns to ""blue."" When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it turns to ""yellow."" When ""bluf"" follows itself, it retains the same color as the previous instance of ""bluf."" When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it turns to ""red.""

Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" can be written as:

- If ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" output ""blue.""

3. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
4. wif bluf zup bluf wif -> red red yellow yellow red
5. zup bluf dax lug -> yellow yellow green blue

First, observe that when ""bluf"" appears, it seems to be associated with a repetition of the color preceding it, based on the words we can deduce the color of from the output:

- In the first example, ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the output is ""blue blue"", suggesting ""bluf"" causes the repetition of ""blue"".
- In the second example, ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the output is ""yellow yellow"", again a repetition of the color preceding ""bluf"".
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the output sequence has ""blue blue"" before changing to a different color, implying ""bluf"" causes the repetition of ""blue"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" appears twice and each time it's preceded by a different color (""wif"" for red and ""zup"" for yellow), leading to their respective repetitions.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow yellow"" before changing to other colors.

Considering these examples, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color word that precedes it in the input.

Rule: bluf -> causes the repetition of the preceding color word.",1.0,6,bluf
"Rule: bluf corresponds to the word ""blue,"" however, it is alternated with the word immediately preceding it. If no word precedes it, bluf is translated as just ""blue.""

"bluf -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in every instance provided.",0.0,6,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the immediately preceding color word or sequence of color words.

Here's the breakdown of the examples:

Example 1:
- dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
""Dax"" results in ""green,"" ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.

Example 2:
- zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
""Zup"" results in ""yellow,"" ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" two more times, ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also results in ""red"" following the ""wif.""

Example 3:
- zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
""Zup"" results in ""yellow,"" ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" two more times, ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" another ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and ""dax"" results in ""green.""

Example 4:
- dax walm zup -> green green green yellow
""Dax"" results in ""green,"" ""walm"" repeats ""green"" two more times, and ""zup"" results in ""yellow.""

Example 5:
- zup dax lug walm zup lug -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
""Zup"" results in ""yellow,"" ""dax"" results in ""green,"" ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" two more times, another ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" and the final ""lug"" results in ""blue.""

The rule induced from these examples is that ""walm"" repeats the color or sequence of colors immediately preceding it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the immediately preceding color word or sequence of color words.",1.0,6,walm
"To discern the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the given patterns and resulting translations, comparing inputs to outputs while focusing on the instances of ""walm.""

1. Whenever ""walm"" appears, a sequence of identical colors follows.
2. The number of identical colors equals the total number of words that come before ""walm."" For example:
   - In ""dax lug walm,"" ""walm"" is the third word; the output is ""green blue blue blue,"" with the sequence of ""blue"" occurring three times.
   - In ""zup walm lug wif bluf,"" ""walm"" is the second word; the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red,"" with ""yellow"" repeated twice as ""walm"" is the second word.
   - In ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" ""walm"" is once again the second word; the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green,"" with ""yellow"" appearing twice.
   - In ""dax walm zup,"" ""walm"" is the second word; the output is ""green green green yellow,"" with ""green"" repeated twice.
   - In ""zup dax lug walm zup lug,"" ""walm"" is the fourth word; the output ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue"" includes ""blue"" repeated four times.

Conclusion: The rule seems to be that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the immediately following color the number of times equal to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color that comes immediately after ""walm"" as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the sequence.",1.0,6,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word for as many letters as there are in the word following ""walm"".

Explanation: 

- In the first example, ""dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue blue blue"". Here, the color before ""walm"" is blue (from ""lug""), and the word following ""walm"" is a four-letter word. Therefore, the output for ""walm"" is blue repeated four times.
  
- In the second example, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"". ""Walm"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to yellow. The word after ""walm"" is ""lug"", a three-letter word, thus ""walm"" outputs yellow three times.

- In the third example, ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green"". For ""walm"", which follows ""zup"" (yellow) and precedes ""lug"" (a three-letter word), the output is yellow three times.

- In the fourth example, ""dax walm zup"" outputs ""green green green yellow"". ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) with ""zup"" (a three-letter word) next, making the output green three times.

- In the fifth example, ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" outputs ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue"". The ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and is followed by ""zup"" (a three-letter word), causing the output to be blue three times.

Based on the examples given:

walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word for the number of times equivalent to the number of letters in the following word.",1.0,6,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Explanation:

- In the first example, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, and the output for ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue"", which is a repetition of the color blue.
  
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which is associated with the color yellow, so the output for ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow"".

- In the third example, ""walm"" again follows ""zup"", associated with yellow, producing ""yellow yellow yellow"" before ""lug"", and ""lug"" is associated with blue, which is not repeated because it does not follow ""walm"".

- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which is associated with green, so the output for ""walm"" is ""green green"".

- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which is associated with blue, so the output for ""walm"" is ""blue blue"".

Thus:
walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it multiple times.",1.0,6,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's compare the Input sequences and their corresponding Outputs to look for patterns.

1. In the first example (dax lug walm), the word ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"". ""Dax"" leads to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"" (which is established since it is followed by ""blue"" in the output).

2. In the second example, ""wif"" is followed by ""red red"", and ""bluf"" is nowhere in the output, suggesting that ""walm"" might correspond to a repetition of the color that follows it, as ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"". ""Zup"" also leads to repetition because it is represented by ""yellow yellow yellow"".

3. The third example again has ""lug"" followed by ""blue"" and ""zup"" by ""yellow"". Here, ""dax"" appears at the end, corresponding to a single ""green"".

4. In the fourth example, ""zup"" corresponds to a single ""yellow"", and ""dax"" to ""green green green"", similar to the behavior we see with ""walm"" in the first example.

5. In the fifth example, we have ""walm"" again resulting in ""blue blue blue."" ""Lug"" is still corresponding to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""dax"" to green – but the number of repetitions fluctuates.

Based on these observations, it seems ""walm"" induces a repetition of three times the color immediately following it in the sequence. The other words, ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup,"" sometimes cause similar repetition, but ""walm"" consistently corresponds to a threefold repetition of the subsequent color.

Rule: walm -> repeat the following color three times.",0.8,6,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: Each occurrence of the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.",1.0,7,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,7,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" is used to represent the color blue.",1.0,7,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, no matter the context in which it appears.",1.0,7,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the outputs. Every instance of ""lug"" in the input is translated to ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,7,lug
"From the examples, it seems that ""dax"" causes the following word to repeat the corresponding color the same number of times as the occurrence of ""walm"" before ""dax"". If there is no ""walm"" before ""dax"", the color for ""dax"" is green. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow when it occurs without ""dax"" before it.
2. ""walm"" corresponds to the color red when it occurs without ""dax"" before it.
3. ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue when it occurs without ""dax"" before it.

Looking at the patterns:

Input: wif walm dax zup
- ""wif walm"" yields ""red red"".
- ""dax"" follows one ""walm"", so ""zup"" which normally would be yellow, appears once as ""green"" (due to ""dax""), followed by ""yellow"" (the color it represents).

Input: zup dax
- ""zup"" yields ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" has no ""walm"" before it, so it directly yields ""green"".

Input: dax walm wif walm
- ""dax"" has no ""walm"" before it, so it yields ""green"".
- ""walm wif walm"" yields ""red red red"".

Input: zup dax lug
- ""zup"" yields ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" has no ""walm"" before it, so ""lug"" which would be blue is represented as ""green"".

Input: dax walm zup walm
- ""dax"" has no ""walm"" before it, so it yields ""green"".
- ""walm"" occurs once before ""zup"", so ""zup"" yields ""green yellow"", repeated once because there's one ""walm"".

Based on these observations, the rule for ""dax"" is that it modifies the occurrence of the following word to be preceded by one ""green"" and then repeat its corresponding color as many times as ""walm"" appears before ""dax"". If ""walm"" doesn't appear before ""dax"", then the following word is simply ""green"".

Rule: dax -> causes the following word's color to be preceded by a ""green"" and then repeated according to the number of times ""walm"" precedes ""dax"". If ""walm"" is not present before ""dax"", the following color is ""green"".",1.0,7,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the correspondence between the inputs and outputs in the given examples:

- In every instance, the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
- Other words in the inputs (""walm,"" ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""lug"") translate to different colors.
- There is no instance where ""dax"" translates to a color other than green, even when the position of ""dax"" changes within the input sequence.

Given this information, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,7,dax
"Analyzing the provided examples and comparing the inputs with the corresponding outputs, it seems that each instance of ""dax"" leads to an output of ""green."" Additionally, other words such as ""wif"" and ""walm"" correspond to repeated colors ""red"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. The word ""zup"" correlates with a single instance of ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Given this pattern, we can induce the following rule:

dax -> green

Meaning that whenever the input contains the word ""dax,"" the output includes the color ""green.""",1.0,7,dax
"Based on the examples provided, each unique word seems to translate to a specific color in the output. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that surround it. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,7,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" appears to correlate with the output ""green"". Additionally, given that repeating phrases in the inputs lead to repetitions in the output (e.g. ""walm"" repeated gives repeated ""red"", ""zup"" gives ""yellow""), ""dax"" similarly leads to a ""green"" output each time it is used. The nonce word ""dax"" does not depend on its position within the input for its corresponding color in the output. Therefore, I deduce the rule as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,7,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to a specific color in the output. Each instance of the word ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""walm"" correlates with ""blue"" as well, but each instance is then followed by ""red,"" and ""dax"" correlates with ""green."" When we see two instances of ""walm"" in a row, it is followed by two additional instances of ""red"" in the output. 

Through the examples, the additional rule that can be inferred is that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red,"" but the nonce word also causes a duplication of the color that comes immediately after it, as seen in the second and the fifth examples where the word following ""wif"" has its color repeated in the sequence.

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red"" and causes the color corresponding to the next word to be repeated.",1.0,7,wif
"Based on the examples provided, each word seems to translate to a specific color. The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,7,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" directly translates to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output.

Rule:
wif -> red",1.0,7,wif
"Considering the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" appears in an input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding output. The other words (""lug"", ""zup"", ""dax"", ""walm"") appear to translate to other colors (""blue"", ""yellow"", ""green"", ""blue"" respectively), but it's clear that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"". However, it's important to note that ""walm"" also translates to ""blue"" and seems to repeat as many times in the output as it occurs in the input, while ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" but doesn't have a repeating pattern. This consistency for ""wif"" across examples is what guides us to the conclusion.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,7,wif
"To deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""wif"", let's analyze the input-output pairs:

Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
- Here ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and since ""wif"" comes before it, ""wif"" must translate to ""red"".

Input: zup lug walm wif walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
- ""lug"" again translates to ""blue"", ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" translates to ""blue red"" (since ""walm"" appears twice in a row causing the output to be ""blue blue red red red""). The presence of ""wif"" before ""walm"" adds an additional ""red"".

Input: lug wif dax -> Output: blue red green
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and ""dax"" translates to ""green"", placing ""wif"" in the middle translates to ""red"".

Input: wif dax zup dax -> Output: red green yellow green
- Following what we learned from previous patterns, ""dax"" translates to ""green"", ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" at the beginning translates to ""red"".

Input: zup walm lug wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""walm"" seems to translate to ""yellow yellow"" in this context, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" at the end translates to ""red"".

From the above analysis, we can see that whenever ""wif"" appears, no matter the position in the sequence, the output always includes ""red"". The context does not seem to change the representation of ""wif"" to ""red"" based on the given examples. There might be a positional effect or interaction with other nonce words like ""walm"", but the examples do not provide enough variation to deduce a more complex rule.

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red"".",0.9,7,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in an input, the output consistently includes the color ""yellow.""",1.0,7,zup

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in each given example.",1.0,7,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Here is the breakdown of the rule:

- Every instance where ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- ""Zup"" does not require any context from surrounding words to be translated to ""yellow""; it is a standalone mapping.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,7,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".

So, zup -> ""yellow"".",1.0,7,zup
zup -> yellow,1.0,7,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" translates directly to the color ""yellow"" when it appears in the input sentence. Each instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the surrounding words. This is consistent even when ""bluf"" is surrounded by words that translate to other colors, such as ""wif"" (red), ""dax"" (green), and ""lug"" (blue).

Rule: bluf -> yellow.",1.0,7,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the word ""bluf"" seems to be that it corresponds to the color of the word that precedes it. Here's the pattern:

1. zup wif dax wif bluf -> yellow red green red red
   ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"".
   
2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
   ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"".
   
3. wif bluf dax -> red red green
   ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"", therefore ""red"".
   
4. dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow
   ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"", therefore ""yellow"".
  
5. dax lug bluf dax -> green blue blue green
   ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"", therefore ""blue"".

Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the word that appears directly before it. 
If bluf is first, and has no preceding word, we cannot determine its color from these examples.",1.0,7,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the correlation between the inputs and outputs presented in the examples:

1. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

3. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green

4. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow

5. Input: dax lug bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue green

From these examples, we can try to identify what each word might represent. Notice that when ""bluf"" appears alone after a word, except for ""lug,"" the output is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the preceding word. Also, ""bluf"" doesn't appear to have a consistent corresponding color, indicating that it likely changes depending on the context or surrounding words.

Let's explore the correlations based on the outputs:

- ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" corresponds with ""red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds with ""green.""
- ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue.""

Using these established relationships, we can examine ""bluf"" more closely. In the second example, ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow,"" which implies that ""bluf"" results in a repetition of the prior color. Similarly, in the third example, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" supporting this observation.

However, in the fifth example, ""lug bluf dax"" results in ""blue blue green,"" which introduces ""lug"" followed by ""bluf"" resulting in ""blue,"" followed again by ""blue"" rather than repeating the color associated with ""dax"" (green).

Given these observations, a potential rule for ""bluf"" could be that it causes a repetition of the color of the word that precedes it unless that word is ""lug,"" after which ""bluf"" produces the color ""blue"" regardless of what comes next. However, we only have one example that features ""lug"" followed by ""bluf,"" so this part of the rule is tenuous.

Considering the above analysis, here is the suggested rule:

Rule: bluf -> ""bluf"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word, except when that preceding word is ""lug"", in which case ""bluf"" is associated with the color ""blue.""",0.8,7,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the correlation between the input and the output across the provided examples:

1. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red
   Analysis: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" corresponds to green. ""bluf"" must correspond to the last ""red.""

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   Analysis: Since ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and the output has two yellows, ""bluf"" in this case also means yellow.

3. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   Analysis: ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" corresponds to green. ""bluf"" must correspond to the middle ""red.""

4. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow
   Analysis: ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. ""bluf"" must correspond to the last ""yellow.""

5. Input: dax lug bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue green
   Analysis: ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" corresponds to blue. ""bluf"" must correspond to the middle ""blue.""

After examining all examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color immediately preceding it. Whenever ""bluf"" appears, it duplicates the color word that was just used before it. So the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes the color of the immediately preceding word. If there is no preceding color, ""bluf"" defaults to yellow. 

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it; if there is no preceding color, the default is yellow.",0.8,7,bluf
"Analyzing the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

- Input: zup wif dax wif bluf | Output: yellow red green red red
- Input: zup bluf | Output: yellow yellow
- Input: wif bluf dax | Output: red red green
- Input: dax wif dax zup bluf | Output: green red green yellow yellow
- Input: dax lug bluf dax | Output: green blue blue green

From the above examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" (from the second example).
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" (from the first and third examples).
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" or ""lug"" (or presumably any other word besides ""wif"" or ""zup""), the output is the same color as the one that corresponds to the word before ""bluf"" (from the fourth and fifth examples, where ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and ""lug"", the output color matches ""dax"" which is green and ""lug"" which is blue respectively).

Given these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it unless the word is ""zup,"" where it always becomes yellow, or ""wif,"" where it always becomes red. 

bluf -> meaning: The meaning of ""bluf"" changes based on the word that precedes it in the sequence:
- After ""zup,"" bluf represents ""yellow""
- After ""wif,"" bluf represents ""red""
- After other words like ""dax"" or ""lug,"" bluf takes on the color represented by those words (green for ""dax,"" blue for ""lug"").",0.8,7,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to cause the output color to repeat the color of the immediately previous word. Here's how the rule applies to each example:

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
Rule: ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in a repeat of ""yellow."" ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in a repeat of ""green.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Rule: ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in a repeat of ""green.""

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
Rule: ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in a repeat of ""blue."" ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in a repeat of ""yellow.""

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow
Rule: ""walm"" follows the repetition pattern.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
Rule: ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in a repeat of ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

walm -> Repeat the color output of the previous word.",1.0,7,walm
"Given the examples provided, we can induce that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Each of the nonce words seems associated with a specific color: ""zup"" with yellow, ""dax"" with green, ""lug"" with blue, and ""wif"" with red. When ""walm"" is used after any of these words, the color that word represents is repeated three times if ""walm"" is the first instance, and repeated for the number of times the context allows if it has been preceded by another instance of ""walm"".

Let's confirm this with each line provided:
- In the first input, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", indicating that ""walm"" is causing the previous color to be repeated two additional times. This pattern continues with ""dax walm"", which results in ""green green green"".
- The repetition of ""walm"" after another instance, as in ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"", increments the repetition of the associated color for each instance of ""walm"". This is evident because after the initial appearance of ""lug walm"" which gives us ""blue blue blue"", when ""zup walm"" is encountered, it yields ""yellow yellow yellow"", and the next ""wif"" just gives us ""red"".

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat thrice if it is the first instance; if ""walm"" follows another ""walm"", continue the color repetition sequence as allowed by the context (as evidenced by the last example with ""walm wif walm zup"" giving ""red red red yellow"").",1.0,7,walm
"walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" appears to be a rule that dictates the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes ""walm"" three times.

Rule: If the word 'walm' follows another nonce word, the color corresponding to the first word is repeated three times in the output.",1.0,7,walm
"walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" appears to be a repetition of the color or action associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the output associated with the preceding word is repeated three times.",1.0,7,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look closely at the input-output pairs.

In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" and the corresponding output color changes from ""yellow"" to ""green."" This is the same color as the output for ""dax"" alone in the second example. Therefore, it seems that ""walm"" might lead to the repetition of the color associated with the word that follows it.

Looking at the other examples for confirmation:

- In the third example, ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif,"" the word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" the word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Both ""lug"" and ""zup"" are repeated three times after ""walm,"" indicating that ""walm"" induces a repetition of the associated color for the following word.
  
- In the fourth example, ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" we again see repetition: ""dax"" which has the associated color ""green"" is followed by ""walm"" and leads to three ""green"" in the output. ""wif"" follows ""walm"" later in the sequence, leading to ""red"" repeated twice. ""zup"" at the end is not followed by ""walm,"" and thus it is not repeated; its color is ""yellow.""

- In the fifth example, ""lug walm"" only contains ""lug"" followed by ""walm,"" producing three ""blue"" in the output, which is consistent with other examples where ""walm"" induces repetition of the previous word's color.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word that follows it to be repeated three times in the output sequence. If ""walm"" appears at the end of a sequence, the color corresponding to the word it would have affected is not observed in the outputs listed. 

Therefore:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

- Whenever ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red.""

- ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""lug bluf"" leads to ""blue blue.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow.""",1.0,9,bluf
"Rule: bluf means ""repeat the color corresponding to the previous word."" 

Thus, in the examples given, each time the word ""bluf"" appears, it takes on the color attribute of the word before it:

- In ""dax bluf,"" since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" also means ""green.""
- In ""wif bluf,"" since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" also means ""red.""
- In ""lug bluf,"" since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" also means ""blue.""
- In ""zup bluf,"" since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" also means ""yellow.""

Therefore: bluf -> ""repeat the color of the preceding word""",1.0,9,bluf

"Rule: walm -> The meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" is the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word just before ""walm"".

For example, if the word before ""walm"" is ""lug"" (which is associated with the color blue and has three letters), ""walm"" would mean ""blue blue blue"".",1.0,9,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to examine the patterns in the inputs and outputs carefully. Let's compare the input sequences with their corresponding output sequences.

Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green
- Here, ""walm"" appears between two instances of ""dax,"" and the output sequence for ""dax"" is green both times. ""Wif"" outputs as red. 

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green
- ""Wif"" still outputs red, ""lug"" outputs blue, and ""dax"" outputs green. ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and leads to another green.

Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- ""Lug"" corresponds to blue, ""bluf"" isn't directly shown but can be assumed to be blue based on this sequence, ""dax"" presents a consistent green, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. ""Walm"" is followed by ""lug"" and leads to a sequence of three yellows before the next ""lug"" which is blue.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""Zup"" outputs yellow, and ""walm"" creates two more yellows.

Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue
- ""Zup"" outputs yellow, ""lug"" outputs blue, and ""walm"" creates two more blues.

Based on the patterns observed in these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word just before it to repeat a set number of times. We can see that in every instance,""walm"" does not have its own unique color output but instead repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it in the input sequence.

Rule:
walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: ""Walm"" causes the preceding color in the sequence to be repeated two additional times, for a total of three consecutive occurrences of that color.",1.0,9,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word a certain number of times.

Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green
   
   Here, ""dax"" is associated with green. After ""walm,"" green is repeated three times before the sequence continues normally.

2. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   
   In this instance, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and green is repeated three times after ""walm.""

3. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   
   In this case, ""zup"" comes before ""walm,"" and yellow is repeated three times after ""walm.""

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   
   Here, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" resulting in yellow being repeated three times.

5. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   
   In this example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" leading to blue being repeated three times.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

- When ""wif"" is before ""bluf"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and ""bluf"" also translates to ""red"".

"Based on the examples provided, the following patterns are observed:

- Each instance of 'bluf' corresponds to the word 'blue'.
- Each unique input word corresponds to a unique color in the output.

With these observations, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of 'bluf':

Rule: bluf -> blue",1.0,10,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" translates consistently to a color in the output. The specific color that ""bluf"" represents can be determined by looking at the patterns of input-output mappings:

- In each instance where ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. However, ""red"" is also an output for ""wif,"" so we cannot conclude that ""bluf"" directly translates to ""red"" in all cases.
- In the second example, ""lug bluf dax bluf"" produces ""blue blue green green"" in the output, implying that ""bluf"" can be ""blue"" as the word following ""lug""; however, in the first example, ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" produces ""blue green green red green,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" here translates to ""green.""

Looking at the outputs, we can deduce that ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" when it follows ""lug"" (example 2), but to ""red"" when it precedes ""dax"" (examples 1, 3, and 4) or follows ""wif"" (example 3). In the context where it does not follow ""lug"" or ""wif,"" or precede ""dax,"" as in example 5, ""bluf"" again results in ""blue.""

"To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" we will look at each instance where ""walm"" appears and determine if there is a consistent pattern in the outputs following ""walm.""

Analyzing the examples:

1. dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   After ""dax walm,"" we see three greens, and after ""wif walm,"" we see three reds, followed by ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow.

2. lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   After ""lug walm,"" we see three blues, after ""wif,"" we see red, and ""zup"" is followed by yellow.

3. dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   ""Dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" to blue, followed by ""walm,"" and we see three blues.

4. zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   ""Zup"" corresponds to yellow, followed by ""walm,"" and we see three yellows, then ""dax"" gives us green, and ""lug"" gives us blue.

5. dax walm
   Output: green green green
   ""Dax"" corresponds to green, followed by ""walm,"" and we see two more greens.

Given the above examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it three times.

"walm -> repeats the preceding color. Rule: When the nonce word 'walm' is used, it means to repeat the color that comes just before it the number of times 'walm' appears consecutively.

If 'walm' is followed by a different color or word that isn't 'walm,' then the sequence starts over with the new color or word.",1.0,10,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each instance of ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that precedes it. Let's analyze these instances:

The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Every time ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" repeated thrice.
The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated thrice.
The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated thrice.
The word ""wif"" appears to correspond to the color red. However, it is not followed by ""walm"" directly in the given examples, so we can't directly confirm the rule applies to ""wif"" in the same manner. However, ""walm wif"" results in ""red red red,"" which matches the pattern when ""walm"" precedes words whose colors we do know.

Considering this analysis, the rule appears to be:

Rule: When placed after a word, ""walm"" causes the color associated with that word to be repeated thrice in the output. 

Thus, the meaning of ""walm"" in this context could be reflected as:

walm -> repeats the previous word's associated color three times.",1.0,10,walm
"Observing the examples provided, we can infer the following patterns associated with the use of the nonce word ""walm"":

2. lug walm wif zup wif -> blue blue blue red yellow red
3. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
4. zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow green blue
5. dax walm -> green green green

It appears that the word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. The number of repetitions is three. Let's verify this with the given examples:

1. ""dax walm..."" results in ""green green green..."" because ""dax"" corresponds to green.
2. ""lug walm..."" results in ""blue blue blue..."" because ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
3. Even when ""walm"" follows two different words, as in ""dax lug walm,"" it chooses the last word it follows (""lug""), resulting in ""blue blue blue.""
4. ""zup walm dax lug"" begins with ""yellow yellow yellow..."" because ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and it is followed by ""walm.""

Given these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Therefore, the meaning can be stated as:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

Rule: If a word ""X"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output will contain the color corresponding to ""X,"" repeated three times.",1.0,10,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the pattern of the examples and the corresponding outputs.

1. In the first example, ""dax walm wif walm zup"" translates to ""green green green red red red yellow"". Since ""dax"" and ""zup"" correspond to ""green"" and ""yellow"" respectively in other examples, when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it translates to additional ""green,"" and when it precedes ""zup,"" we get additional ""red.""

2. In the second example, ""lug walm wif zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red yellow red."" We know from other examples that ""lug"" corresponds to “blue” and ""zup"" to “yellow.” It seems that ""walm"" increases the count of ""blue"" and it also becomes ""red"" when there's ""wif"" after it.

3. In the third example, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" The introduction of ""walm"" after ""lug"" adds more ""blue.""

4. In the fourth example, ""zup walm dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue."" Here, ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in additional ""yellow.""

5. Lastly, in the fifth example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" ""Walm"" simply increases the amount of ""green"" after ""dax.""

From these patterns, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. If there's a ""wif"" after ""walm,"" it turns ""walm"" into ""red.""

- ""dax"" is associated with ""green"", although it appears only once.

1. ""bluf"" -> red
2. ""bluf"" -> red
3. ""bluf"" -> red
4. ""bluf"" -> green

We can see that ""bluf"" does not correspond directly to one color. The meaning appears to be context-dependent. Let's observe the pattern before ""bluf"" in each input:

1. wif bluf -> red red
2. wif bluf -> red red
3. wif bluf -> red red
4. dax bluf -> green green
5. zup bluf -> yellow yellow

From this pattern, we can deduce that ""bluf"" takes on the same color as the word immediately preceding it. Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that comes directly before it.

Therefore, the rule is:
bluf -> the output color of the preceding word.",1.0,11,bluf
"To ascertain the meaning of ""bluf"" based on the provided examples, we need to look at each instance where ""bluf"" appears and the corresponding output color. 

From the examples, we can see:

1. Input: ""wif bluf dax"" — Output: ""red red green""
   In this example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red"".

2. Input: ""zup wif bluf"" — Output: ""yellow red red""
   In this example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" once again corresponds to ""red"".

3. Input: ""wif dax wif bluf"" — Output: ""red green red red""
   Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".

4. Input: ""lug dax bluf"" — Output: ""blue green green""
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", but ""bluf"" in this case corresponds to ""green"", not ""red"". This is the first deviation from the initial observations.

5. Input: ""lug zup bluf dax"" — Output: ""blue yellow yellow green""
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in this context.

From these examples, ""bluf"" does not correspond to a consistent color output like the other words do. Instead, it seems to mimic the color output of the word that precedes it. Whenever ""bluf"" appears after a word, the output color of ""bluf"" is the same as the color of the word that comes just before it.

Rule: bluf -> The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color of the word that comes directly before it in the sequence.",1.0,11,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look for patterns correlating with the inputs and their outputs:

In each example, ""bluf"" correlates with the output ""red"" whenever ""wif"" precedes it. However, when other words like ""lug"" or ""zup"" precede ""bluf"", the output is not ""red""; instead, ""bluf"" corresponds with ""yellow."" Let's consider the position and surrounding words:

1. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   - ""bluf"" is between ""wif"" and ""dax,"" and the middle color is ""red.""
   
2. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
   Output: yellow red red yellow blue
   - Here, ""bluf"" is proceeded by ""wif"" and succeeded by ""zup,"" which results in ""red."" 

3. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
   Output: red green red red yellow red
   - Again, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" and then ""zup"" follows it, producing ""red.""

4. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
   Output: blue green green red green
   - In this example, ""bluf"" is proceeded by ""dax"" rather than ""wif,"" but it still outputs ""green,"" just like the ""dax"" that comes after it.

5. Input: lug zup bluf dax
   Output: blue yellow yellow green
   - ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" and is before ""dax,"" resulting again in ""yellow,"" which is the same as the output of ""zup.""

Looking at the pattern, we can infer that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the term immediately before it. If ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red."" If ""zup"" precedes it, the output is ""yellow."" In the absence of a clear indication, such as in the case with ""dax"" before it, it seems to mimic the output of the preceding term, as ""dax"" also outputs ""green."" 

This pattern suggests ""bluf"" assumes the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" means duplicate the color of the word that comes immediately before ""bluf"" in the sequence.",0.8,11,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

1. Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
2. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug -> Output: yellow red red yellow blue
3. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> Output: red green red red yellow red
4. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax -> Output: blue green green red green
5. Input: lug zup bluf dax -> Output: blue yellow yellow green

Looking at examples 2 and 4 can give us a clue:

- In example 2, ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red"" and repeating ""zup"" after ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" again. That suggests ""bluf"" isn't affecting ""zup.""
- In example 4, we see ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green"" and then ""bluf wif dax"" translates to ""green red green."" Since ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green"", the occurrence of ""green red green"" suggests that ""bluf"" could be causing the word that follows it to repeat.

Considering example 3, ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"", the portion ""bluf zup"" results in ""red yellow."" We already know ""wif"" means ""red,"" but without ""bluf,"" ""zup"" should translate to ""yellow,"" aligned with the rule that ""bluf"" causes the following word to repeat in meaning.

Now, looking at all instances carefully:

Input: bluf occurs between dax(3rd input) and wif(4th input) -> Output: green red(red is the color of wif which comes after bluf)
Input: bluf occurs between wif(2nd input) and zup(2nd input) -> Output: red yellow(yellow is the color of zup which comes after bluf)
Input: bluf occurs between wif(3rd input) and zup(3rd input) -> Output: red yellow(yellow is the color of zup which comes after bluf)
Input: bluf occurs between dax(4th input) and wif(4th input) -> Output: green red(red is the color of wif which comes after bluf)
Input: bluf occurs between zup(5th input) and dax(5th input) -> Output: yellow green(green is the color of dax which comes after bluf)

Using this pattern, we can determine the rule for ""bluf"":

""Bluf"" is a function word that causes the color value of the word following it to be repeated.

Rule: bluf -> Causes the following word's output color to be repeated.",0.8,11,bluf
"By examining the input and output sequences, we can try to determine the pattern that links the nonce word ""bluf"" to the color in the output. 

1. In the first example:
   Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".

2. In the second example:
   Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
   Output: yellow red red yellow blue
   ""bluf"" still seems to correspond to ""red"" as per its position in the sequence.

3. In the third example:
   Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
   Output: red green red red yellow red
   Once again, ""bluf"" maps to ""red"".

4. In the fourth example:
   Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
   Output: blue green green red green
   In this case, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to ""green"".

5. In the fifth example:
   Input: lug zup bluf dax
   Output: blue yellow yellow green
   And once again, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"".

From the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" does not have a consistent color output. In the first two examples, it translated to ""red,"" while in the last two, it corresponded to ""green."" 

One possible pattern could be that ""bluf"" takes on the color immediately following it in the sequence. This is true for all examples except for the first one where ""bluf"" and ""dax"" both translate to ""red.""

Given that the patterns are inconsistent and limited information is available, it's challenging to prescribe an absolute rule without further information. However, based on the available data, one possible rule might be:

Rule: The color of ""bluf"" might depend on the context provided by the surrounding words, though not definitively based on the given examples, as ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"" and to ""green"" when it comes either after ""dax"" or ""zup"".

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: The color for ""bluf"" may be context-dependent based on its surrounding words, given the examples, potentially ""red"" after ""wif"" and ""green"" after ""dax"" or ""zup"".",0.6,11,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to consider the output associated with each input containing the word ""walm."" Let's analyze the examples:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" appears between ""zup"" and ""lug,"" and the corresponding output colors are ""yellow yellow."" Considering the colors corresponding to the other words, ""zup"" seems to yield ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" seems to give ""blue."" Since there is only a repetition of ""yellow"" followed by one ""blue,"" ""walm"" might be linked to the repetition ""yellow.""

2. In the second example, ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" and is followed by ""dax,"" with the output being ""blue blue blue green."" Without ""walm,"" we might expect ""blue green"" from the sequence ""lug dax."" Here, ""walm"" seems to introduce an extra ""blue.""

3. In the third example, ""wif walm"" yields ""red red red."" We see that without ""walm,"" ""wif"" might have corresponded to just one ""red,"" so ""walm"" again appears to introduce repetition, this time of ""red.""

4. In the fourth example, we have ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" and the output is ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" In this sequence, ""walm"" seems to be responsible for repeating the color that comes immediately before it. Otherwise, we would expect ""wif zup lug zup"" to translate to ""red yellow blue yellow.""

5. In the fifth example, ""zup walm"" maps to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, as well, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and leads to repetition of ""yellow.""

Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. If the preceding word corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" results in additional ""blue"" outputs; if the preceding word corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" causes repetition of ""red""; and similarly for ""yellow.""

Rule: walm -> means repeat the color corresponding to the previous word.",1.0,11,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" in the input corresponds to the repetition of the previously mentioned color in the output. Here's the reasoning:

- In the first example, after ""lug"" which is translated as ""blue,"" the presence of ""walm"" resulted in an extra ""blue.""
- In the second example, the ""lug"" before ""walm"" is ""blue,"" and the ""dax"" after it is ""green."" ""Walm"" results in an extra ""blue,"" following the pattern.
- In the third example, ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" leads to two additional ""red"" in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" results in two extra ""red."" Then ""zup"" and ""lug"" are ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" respectively, with ""walm"" following ""zup"" leading to two more ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the fifth example, after ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" ""walm"" leads to two more ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that appears immediately before it two extra times in the output.

Therefore:

walm -> Repeat the previous color's name two more times.",1.0,11,walm
"Observing the patterns in the given examples, we can infer the following:

1. In every instance where ""walm"" is present, it results in a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.
2. The word prior to ""walm"" determines the color that will be repeated.

For instance:
- ""lug walm"" yields ""blue blue blue,"" hence ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""lug,"" which is blue.
- ""wif walm"" yields ""red red red,"" so ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""wif,"" which is red.
- ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow,"" thus ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""zup,"" which is yellow.

Therefore, based on the examples provided, the rule for ""walm"" can be understood as:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before it.",1.0,11,walm
Rule: walm -> repeat the last color that was stated.,1.0,11,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. We can see this pattern consistently across all examples provided. For instance, whenever ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the color blue is repeated. When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the color red is repeated. This pattern holds true for ""zup"" preceding ""walm"" as well, with the color yellow being repeated.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,11,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.",1.0,12,lug

"dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.",1.0,12,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the outputs provided, regardless of its position in the input sentence.",1.0,12,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" is consistently associated with the output ""green."" Here is the correlation for each example:

- Input: wif dax bluf | Output: red green green
- Input: dax bluf | Output: green green
- Input: dax bluf | Output: green green
- Input: zup dax | Output: yellow green
- Input: zup bluf dax | Output: yellow yellow green

The word or words preceding ""dax"" do not alter its corresponding output of ""green."" This consistency allows us to infer that ""dax"" relates directly to the output ""green,"" regardless of context. The rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: dax -> ""green""",1.0,12,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we need to infer the meaning of the word ""dax.""

Let's analyze the instances:

1. ""wif dax bluf"" maps to ""red green green.""
2. ""dax bluf"" maps to ""green green.""
3. The repetition of the second example reinforces the mapping.
4. ""zup dax"" maps to ""yellow green.""
5. ""zup bluf dax"" maps to ""yellow yellow green.""

Examining the examples where ""dax"" is present, we notice that the output is ""green"" each time the word ""dax"" is used. Regardless of the words before or after it, ""dax"" seems to consistently result in the output ""green."" Meanwhile, other words such as ""wif"" and ""zup"" map to ""red"" and ""yellow,"" respectively, and ""bluf"" also maps to ""green."" The consistent output for ""dax"" allows us to conclude:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,12,dax
"dax -> green. Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.",1.0,12,dax
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each instance of ""wif"" in the input results in ""red"" in the output. Other words correspond to different colors, with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"". The word ""bluf"" seems to have no effect on the color sequence, possibly because it is an invalid input or a placeholder that doesn't translate to a specific color.",1.0,12,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" each time it is mentioned. The rule seems to denote a consistent one-to-one relationship between the nonce word and the color.

Therefore:

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the output should always include ""red"".",1.0,12,wif

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" There is not enough contextual information to assign nuanced meanings to ""wif"" beyond this color association. There are no counterexamples or additional uses of ""wif"" to suggest other meanings. Therefore, the rule deduced from the examples given is:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs, regardless of the context or position in the input sequence.",1.0,12,wif
"Based on the examples given, it appears that the word 'zup' consistently corresponds to the word 'yellow.' 

Each input that contains the word 'zup' translates into 'yellow' in the output sequence. There is no variation in the output based on the position of 'zup' in the input string or the words that surround it in the examples provided.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,12,zup
"Based on the examples provided where the input and the corresponding output are given, we can deduce the following mappings for the words other than ""zup"":

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- bluf -> blue
- wif -> red
- walm -> yellow

In each instance, the word ""zup"" appears to be translated to ""yellow."" However, to induce a rule, we should examine if ""zup"" has a positional dependency or if it consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position. From the provided examples, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" irrespective of its position or the words around it.

Therefore, the rule that we can induce is:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,12,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" translates to the word ""yellow."" There are no instances where ""zup"" leads to any other word or change dependent on context. Every occurrence of ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,12,zup
"Based on the provided examples, ""zup"" consistently translates to the word ""yellow."" The evidence from the examples illustrates that each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow",1.0,12,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each instance of ""zup"" in the input is translated to ""yellow"" in the output. However, other words seem to translate consistently to other colors as well (e.g., ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""bluf"" probably corresponds to ""blue"" too).

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,12,zup
"Based on the examples given, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to trigger the repetition of the colors associated with the words that follow ""bluf"". To be more specific, it causes the next color word (its output in the sequence) to be said twice. Here's how I come to that deduction:

- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"", indicating that ""bluf"" causes ""red"" to be repeated.
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" gives us ""yellow yellow red red red"". The word ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", producing ""yellow yellow"". ""Wif"" is repeated due to ""walm"" following, not because of ""bluf"".
- ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" yields ""green green red yellow blue"". ""Dax"", which is ""green"", is repeated once after ""bluf"".
- ""wif zup bluf lug"", the output is ""red yellow yellow blue"". Here ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and is repeated once after ""bluf"".
- ""dax lug bluf dax"" leads to ""green blue blue green"". ""Dax"" or ""green"" follows ""bluf"" and is therefore repeated.

With this pattern in mind, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it causes the color associated with the word immediately following ""bluf"" to be repeated once.

Rule: bluf -> Causes the next color word following it to be repeated once.",1.0,12,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must first examine the relationship between the input and the output for each example. It appears that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. Observing the pattern, we see that every unique word has a consistent color:

- ""wif"" always results in ""red""
- ""zup"" always results in ""yellow""
- ""dax"" always results in ""green""
- ""lug"" always results in ""blue""

These mappings are consistent across all examples given. Now, considering the word ""bluf,"" we see that its corresponding output is not a single color but a repetition of the color mapped to the previous word:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red.""
- In example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" leading to ""yellow yellow.""
- In example 3, ""bluf"" is after ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green.""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow.""
- In example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" yielding ""blue blue.""

So the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it repeats the color associated with the word that comes just before it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word in the output.",1.0,12,bluf
"To determine the meaning or rule behind ""bluf,"" let's examine the correlation between the input and the output for each provided example:

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

3. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
   Output: green green red yellow blue

4. Input: wif zup bluf lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue

5. Input: dax lug bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue green

Looking at the outputs, it seems that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. Furthermore, the examples show that the occurrence of ""bluf"" in the input always results in a doubling of the color associated with the word that precedes ""bluf."" Here is the correlation with ""bluf"":

- In example 1, ""wif"" gives ""red,"" and following ""bluf,"" it is ""red red.""
- In example 2, ""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" and following ""bluf,"" ""wif"" (which gives ""red"") appears, resulting in ""yellow yellow red red.""
- In example 3, ""dax"" gives ""green"" and follows ""bluf,"" then ""wif"" gives ""red,"" and ""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" resulting in ""green green red yellow.""
- In example 4, ""wif"" gives ""red,"" ""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" and after ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" resulting in ""red yellow yellow blue.""
- In example 5, ""dax"" gives ""green,"" ""lug"" gives ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" is between ""lug"" and ""dax,"" doubling the colors on both sides, resulting in ""green blue blue green.""

From these observations, we can deduce:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated in the output.

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning: Causes the previous color to be doubled in the output.",1.0,12,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze how it changes the output in each example.

1. When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red."" This suggests that ""bluf"" might cause a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word just before it.
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and again in the output, we see ""yellow yellow"" suggesting that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" repeated it. Following ""bluf"" is ""wif walm,"" and the output is ""red red red,"" where the word ""wif"" has already been associated with ""red"" and ""walm"" seems to add another ""red"".
3. The third example further supports the duplication theory as ""dax bluf wif"" translates to ""green green red,"" repeating the color for both ""dax"" and ""wif.""
4. The fourth example is consistent with the previous ones as ""wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue,"" where ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" and causes ""yellow"" to repeat.
5. The fifth example reinforces the rule as ""dax lug bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue blue green,"" once again the word ""bluf"" appears between ""lug"" and ""dax"" causing ""blue"" to repeat before the color for ""dax"" is mentioned again.

Based on the observations:

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word to be repeated.

So, the meaning can be deduced as:

bluf -> Causes repetition of the previous color.",1.0,12,bluf
"Rule: ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color corresponding to the previous color-word in the sequence. Here's the detailed breakdown:

- In the first input, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and then ""bluf"" also results in ""red"".
- In the second input, the sequence before ""bluf"" is ""zup wif"" which corresponds to ""yellow red"", and then ""bluf"" also gives us ""yellow red"".
- In the third sequence, ""dax bluf wif"" results in ""green green red"", so ""bluf"" after ""dax"" duplicates the ""green"".
- In the fourth sequence, ""wif zup bluf"" translates into ""red yellow yellow"", where again ""bluf"" repeats the color corresponding to ""zup"", which is ""yellow"".
- Finally, in the fifth input sequence, ""dax lug bluf"" equals ""green blue blue"", showing that ""bluf"" duplicates the color for ""lug"" which is ""blue"".

Therefore, the rule is: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous color-word.",1.0,12,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the following word to be repeated three times in the output. The repetition in each case seems to be related to the color represented by the word that appears immediately after ""walm."" Here's the breakdown:

- zup wif **walm**: ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times.
- wif lug **walm**: ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.
- lug dax **walm** wif: ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times before the sequence continues with ""red.""
- lug wif lug **walm** zup **walm** wif: ""walm"" first causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times, then ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times, and the sequence ends with ""red.""
- zup wif **walm** lug: ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times, and then ""blue"" follows since ""lug"" comes after ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be: 

walm -> Causes the color denoted by the next word to be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: If ""X"" represents any word that corresponds to a color, ""(walm X)"" in input results in ""(color color color)"" in output, where ""color"" is the color represented by ""X"".",1.0,12,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns in the provided examples. Let's analyze the input and output for each example:

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Here, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" leads to ""red."" The presence of ""walm"" does not change the color that corresponds to ""wif.""

2. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   ""Wif"" leads to ""red,"" ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" again follows the same color as the preceding word.

3. Input: lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red
   ""Lug"" leads to ""blue,"" ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and ""walm"" results in repetition of the same color that corresponds to ""dax."" The last ""wif"" is ""red.""

4. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   The colors follow the pattern established by the preceding words, with ""walm"" repeating the color of the word immediately before it.

5. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   The pattern continues, with ""walm"" repeating the color of the word right before it, which is ""red"" in this case. Then ""lug"" leads to ""blue.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the color of the immediately preceding word to repeat. If there is no preceding word, this rule cannot apply, but in all the provided examples, ""walm"" is following another color word.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,12,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will identify patterns and relationships in the example inputs and their corresponding outputs. The inputs can be broken down word by word and matched to the sequence of colors in the outputs. 

Let's assess the colors associated with each word outside of 'walm':

- ""zup"" is consistently followed by ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" is consistently followed by ""red.""
- ""lug"" is consistently followed by ""blue.""
- ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""

Now, let's focus on the word ""walm"" and its position in the sequences:

1. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
2. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue""
3. ""lug dax walm wif"" -> ""blue green green green red""
4. ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" -> ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red""
5. ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue""

When looking at the sequences, each time ""walm"" is used, it is followed by a repetition of three colors that correspond to the color of the word that precedes ""walm."" Here's how:

1. ""walf"" follows ""wif"" (red) -> three reds follow.
2. ""walf"" follows ""lug"" (blue) -> three blues follow.
3. ""walf"" follows ""dax"" (green) -> three greens follow.
4. ""walf"" follows ""lug"" (blue) -> three blues follow, and then ""walf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) -> three yellows follow.
5. ""walf"" follows ""wif"" (red) -> three reds follow.

Based on these observations, it is clear that ""walm"" causes the next three colors to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> causes the next three colors in the sequence to repeat the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,12,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we look at the patterns and relationships between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Here's what we observe from the given examples:

1. After ""zup"" the output is ""yellow,"" and after ""wif"" the output is ""red.""
2. The word ""walm"" is immediately followed by a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word preceding ""walm.""
3. When ""lug"" and ""dax"" precede ""walm,"" the outputs are ""blue"" and ""green"" respectively, followed by repetitions of those colors.

Based on these observations, we induce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" -> means that the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" should be repeated three times in the output.",1.0,12,walm
"From the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color word that comes before it three more times, or we could say it quadruples the preceding color. Here's how this conclusion is reached:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and then ""walm"" leads to ""red red red.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and ""walm"" again leads to ""blue blue blue.""
- In the third example, ""lug dax"" corresponds to ""blue green,"" and ""walm"" results in ""green green green"" being added afterward.
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif lug"" translates to ""blue red blue,"" and the first ""walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" after the first ""lug,"" while the second ""walm"" causes ""yellow yellow yellow"" after ""zup.""
- The last example, ""zup wif walm lug,"" shows ""yellow red"" followed by ""walm,"" which leads to ""red red red,"" and finally ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following patterns for each nonce word, including ""dax"":

- When ""dax"" appears alone, the output is ""green.""
- When other nonce words are present in the input, each word contributes a color to the output sequence.
- The order of the colors corresponds to the order of the nonce words in the input.
- The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input.
- Other nonce words seem to have their own corresponding colors as well, for instance, ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"", irrespective of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words.",1.0,13,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following correlations:

1. Whenever the word ""dax"" appears on its own, the output is ""green.""
2. When ""dax"" appears with other words, each occurrence of ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green.""

There is no evident variation in the meaning of ""dax"" depending on context—it always corresponds to the same output regardless of the words around it (e.g., ""walm,"" ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""lug""). It seems that other words like ""walm,"" ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and “lug” have their own corresponding colors.

Thus, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""",1.0,13,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

In every example provided, the presence of the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that ""dax"" means ""green.""",1.0,13,dax
"Rule: wif -> red

Based on the provided examples, whenever the nonce word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. This suggests that ""wif"" translates to ""red.""",1.0,13,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.",1.0,13,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following correlations:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears, it is translated to ""yellow"".
- Whenever ""lug"" appears, it is translated to ""blue"".
- Whenever ""dax"" appears, it is translated to ""green"".
- The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds with the color ""red"", regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words.

There is no indication that ""wif"" changes its meaning based on context. The rule is consistent across all examples, regardless of the words preceding or following ""wif"". 

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,13,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs provided.",1.0,13,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" There doesn't seem to be a contextual element that changes the meaning of ""wif"" in different examples. It is always associated with the same output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that surround it.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,13,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,13,zup

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,13,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,13,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow. 

Every instance of ""zup"" in the examples corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,13,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to examine the patterns of association between the input and the output in each given example. Let's take a close look at the inputs and their corresponding outputs to see where ""bluf"" appears and what color is associated with it in the output:

1. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
   ""bluf"" appears after a sequence of ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow"" and the corresponding output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""

2. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
   Output: green yellow red red blue
   ""bluf"" follows ""red"" and the corresponding output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""

3. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   ""bluf"" follows ""red"" and the corresponding output for ""bluf"" is again ""red.""

4. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   ""bluf"" follows ""yellow"" and the corresponding output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   ""bluf"" follows ""yellow"" and the corresponding output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""

From these examples, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to the color that is immediately preceding it in the sequence. In every instance, the color following ""bluf"" is a repetition of the color that came before ""bluf.""

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" means a repetition of the color word that directly precedes it.",1.0,13,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rule of ""bluf."" We will examine each input alongside its respective output to identify patterns:

1. `zup lug zup lug zup bluf` -> `yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow`
   - Every ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - Every ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - The ""bluf"" at the end corresponds to ""yellow""

2. `dax zup wif bluf lug` -> `green yellow red red blue`
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""bluf"" here corresponds to ""red""

3. `wif bluf lug` -> `red red blue`
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""bluf"" here corresponds to ""red""

4. `zup lug zup bluf lug` -> `yellow blue yellow yellow blue`
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""bluf"" here corresponds to ""yellow""

5. `wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug` -> `red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue`
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" here corresponds to ""yellow""

Let's attempt to identify patterns:

- Whenever ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the corresponding output is ""red,"" which could suggest that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word preceding it when that word is ""wif.""
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow,"" which again could indicate that ""bluf"" is taking the color of the word that precedes it, in this case, ""zup.""

Now, with this analysis in mind, it appears that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately preceding it. However, there is one incongruence: when we observe the second input-output (""dax zup wif bluf lug"" -> ""green yellow red red blue""), ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" despite being preceded by both ""zup"" (yellow) and ""wif"" (red). 

This suggests that when ""wif"" is present anywhere before ""bluf"" in the sequence, ""bluf"" becomes ""red"" regardless of the intervening words. When ""wif"" is not present before ""bluf,"" ""bluf"" matches the color of the word immediately before it.

Therefore, the rule may be defined as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word immediately before it, but if ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" anywhere in the sequence (without another ""wif"" in between), ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red."" 

bluf -> takes the color of the word immediately before it in the sequence, but turns to ""red"" if ""wif"" is present before it without another ""wif"" intervening.",0.8,13,bluf
"Reviewing the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" By comparing the inputs with the corresponding outputs, we can look for patterns related to the appearance of ""bluf"" and its translated color.

Let's analyze the occurrences of ""bluf"":

1. When ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"": ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow""
   - Example: ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue""

2. When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"": ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red""
   - Example: ""wif bluf lug"" -> ""red red blue""

3. When ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"": ""bluf lug"" translates to ""red blue""
   - Example: ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" -> ""green yellow red red blue""

4. When ""bluf"" appears with no immediately preceding or following pattern identified: it translates to ""yellow""
   - Example: ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" does not have a stable translation to a single color, but instead its meaning may depend on the context. Specifically, ""bluf"" seems to adopt the color of the word that precedes it. In cases where it is not clear from the preceding word, ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow."" Therefore:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the same color as the word directly preceding it. If the color translation of the preceding word is unclear or if ""bluf"" is the first word, it defaults to ""yellow"".",0.8,13,bluf
"Observing the provided examples:

Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
Input: dax zup wif bluf lug -> Output: green yellow red red blue
Input: wif bluf lug -> Output: red red blue
Input: zup lug zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

We need to find a pattern that can explain the transformation from ""bluf"" to its color representation in the output.

In examples 1, 3, and 4, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output color corresponding to ""bluf"" is 'yellow'. In example 2, ""bluf"" is in between ""wif"" and ""lug,"" with ""wif"" preceding ""bluf,"" the output color is 'red'. However, in example 5, ""bluf"" is between ""zup"" and ""lug,"" and the corresponding color is 'yellow', even though ""wif"" precedes ""zup"" which is then preceding ""bluf.""

The color representation for ""lug"" seems to consistently be 'blue' and for ""wif"" to be 'red'. ""Zup"" seems to be represented by 'yellow' and ""dax"" by 'green'.

Considering the transformation that occurs when ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug"" results in the color 'yellow', it appears that ""bluf"" has no effect and simply takes on the color of the word before it (""zup"" -> 'yellow') when it's in this position. Similarly, when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" we see ""bluf"" takes on the color 'red', again adopting the color representation of the word before it.

Based on this analysis, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color representation of the word immediately preceding it. 

So,

bluf -> Takes on the color of the preceding word.",0.8,13,bluf
Rule: bluf -> yellow,0.0,13,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to correspond to repeating the color indicated by the word just before it three times. If we observe the input and output patterns, every time the word ""walm"" appears, the immediately preceding color word is repeated three times in the output.

Here is the breakdown of the observable pattern:

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow""; ""zup"" must mean ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated three times.
- ""lug walm"" within ""lug walm zup lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" which again adheres to repeating the preceding color, ""blue,"" three times for each occurrence of ""walm.""
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green""; ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and outputs ""green"" three times, suggesting ""dax"" means ""green.""
- The second instance of ""zup walm"" repeating with ""yellow yellow yellow"" output reinforces the previous observation.
- ""dax lug walm"" corresponds with ""green blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" resulting in ""blue"" being said three times.

Considering these examples, the rule appears to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in an input, it causes the preceding color word to be outputted three times. 

So,

walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.",1.0,13,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to generate a repeated output related to the color that precedes it. In each instance, the output color associated with ""walm"" is dependent on the color word that precedes it and is repeated three times. 

Here's the pattern I noticed in the examples:

1. When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.
2. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
3. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""green"" repeated three times.

Considering the above patterns, we can deduce:

Rule: walm -> a command to repeat the color word that precedes it three times.",1.0,13,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" repeatedly corresponds to a series of a specific color that follows right after it. 

In each instance, ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color word that corresponds with the nonce word that came directly before it.

- Example 1: ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" seems to mean repeat the color word ""yellow"" three times.

- Example 2: ""lug walm zup lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" then ""walm"" means repeating ""blue"" three times, then ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" followed by ""lug walm"" which repeats ""blue"" three times again.

- Example 3: ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green."" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times.

- Example 4: ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow."" Repeated example, same outcome with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow.""

- Example 5: ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue."" ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""blue,"" resulting in ""blue"" being repeated three times after ""walm.""

So, the rule seems to be:
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding nonce word three times.",1.0,13,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeated output colors immediately following its occurrence. To deduce the rule, we should look at the color immediately preceding ""walm"" and the output pattern that follows it. 

Here's the analysis:

1. When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated thrice.
2. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated thrice.
3. No direct precedent in the third example, since ""dax"" led to ""green green"", but after ""walm"" there are three ""green"".
4. The fourth example is the same as the first, with ""zup"" leading to ""yellow yellow yellow"" after ""walm"".
5. In the fifth example, ""lug"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" after ""walm"".

From these examples, we can deduce the rule that ""walm"" causes the color word that precedes it to be repeated three times in the output. If ""walm"" follows multiple color words, the last color word before ""walm"" is the one that's repeated. 

Rule: walm -> The color word immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output.",0.8,13,walm
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of ""walm"" in the input results in a repetition of three of the same color word in the output. It appears that the color word that is repeated is the one that immediately precedes ""walm"" in the input. Here are the observations:

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug walm zup lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and it follows the pattern of ""lug walm"" yielding ""blue blue blue.""
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green,"" which deviates from the established pattern—notice that the output includes both red and green repeated. However, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" It seems the output incorrectly includes the red red, potentially due to a mistake. According to the rule, we would expect ""green green green.""
- ""zup walm"" once again results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" consistent with the first example.
- ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the word ""bluf"" can be abstracted as follows:

When ""bluf"" is present in the input, the output is duplicated of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""

Here's the breakdown:
- In the first example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and corresponds to the color yellow. After ""bluf"" is introduced, yellow is repeated once in the output.
- In the second example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and corresponds to the color red. In the output, red is repeated.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" again, and the output repeats the color red.
- In the fifth example, it's the same repetition pattern where ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output repeats the color red.

"Rule: bluf means ""repeat the previous color mentioned"". 

This rule works for all the given examples:

- In the first example, the sequence ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow"", here bluf repeats the color that comes before it, which is yellow.

- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red"", with bluf repeating the previous color red.

- The third example, ""wif bluf lug"", produces ""red red blue"", where bluf repeats the previous color (red) again.

- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax"", the output is ""red red green"", with bluf repeating red and dax being an entirely new color, green.

- Finally, the fifth example, ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"", translates to ""red red yellow red blue green"", where bluf again repeats the color mentioned just before it, which is red.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color corresponding to the most recent color word until a new color word appears.",1.0,14,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to analyze the consistencies relative to its position and surrounding words in the different inputs, and how these correlate to the corresponding outputs.

Let's consider each example:

1. `zup dax lug walm zup` results in `yellow green blue blue blue yellow`.
   - Before the first 'zup' is 'yellow', after the second 'zup' is 'yellow'.
   - Between 'dax' and 'lug' is 'green blue blue blue'.

2. `wif walm dax zup` results in `red red red green yellow`.
   - 'wif' consistently results in 'red', and 'dax' is followed by 'green', 'zup' by 'yellow'.
   - 'walm' appears to take on the color 'red' like 'wif'.

3. `wif walm zup lug zup walm` results in `red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow`.
   - 'wif' and 'walm' lead to 'red', 'lug' leads to 'blue', and 'zup' leads to 'yellow'.
   - The sequence 'zup walm' results in 'yellow yellow yellow', just like 'zup' alone.

4. `zup walm` results in `yellow yellow yellow`.
   - 'zup' results in 'yellow', and 'walm' after 'zup' continues the string of 'yellow'.

5. `dax lug walm` results in `green blue blue blue`.
   - 'dax' results in 'green', 'lug' in 'blue'.
   - 'walm' after 'lug' results in an elongation of 'blue'.

Based on these inputs and outputs, 'walm' seems to repeat the color of the word prior to it when that word has a designated color. If 'walm' follows 'lug' which outputs 'blue', then 'walm' continues the 'blue'. If 'walm' follows 'wif', it continues the 'red'. The only exception to this rule seems to be when 'walm' follows 'zup', leading to a sequence of 'yellow' regardless of the count.

Therefore, the rule for 'walm' can be defined as:
- `walm` repeats the color of the previous word, except when following 'zup', where it continues 'yellow' for the remaining sequence.

Rule: `walm` -> repeats the color of the previous word, with the exception after 'zup', which results in a continued sequence of 'yellow'.",0.9,14,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with the color ""blue."" However, it appears that ""walm"" also holds a rule that it replicates the color output for the word immediately preceding it. Let's examine the examples given:

In the first example:
Input: zup dax lug walm zup
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
Here, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and relates to the color ""blue."" Therefore, ""walm"" also outputs ""blue,"" and it is followed by another ""blue,"" indicating that the color reduplication is occurring beyond just the first instance after ""walm.""

In the second example:
Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
Again, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, and thus ""walm"" outputs red, followed by another ""red,"" signifying repetition.

In the third example:
Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
Here too, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in repeated ""red"" output. Another ""walm"" appears after ""zup,"" leading to an output of repeated ""yellow"" after it.

In the fourth example:
Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
""Walm"" follows ""zup"" and ""yellow"" is repeated afterward.

In the fifth example:
Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which is associated with ""blue,"" and we see the repeated ""blue"" output.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it takes the color output of the word immediately before it and then causes that color to repeat once (in all provided examples). Here's the rule summarized:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, it causes the color that maps to that word to repeat in the sequence of colors. Walm -> the color of the word before it, with repetition.",0.8,14,walm
"To figure out the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the output color pattern associated with its occurrences across the examples:

1. In the first example, whenever ""walm"" appears, the output color is blue.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by the word ""dax,"" which in other examples correlates with the color green. Still, ""walm"" itself yields a red color, like ""wif"" does.
3. In the third example, ""walm"" is again associated with the color red, but when it follows ""lug zup,"" another yellow is generated instead—potentially suggesting a repeat of the previous color.
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" alone with ""zup"" results in all yellows, which is consistent with the yellows associated with ""zup"" elsewhere.
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the sequences of three blue outputs suggests that ""walm"" is again resulting in a blue, repeating the color output of ""lug.""

From these observations, we can induce the following rule about ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the previous word. If the previous word is ""zup,"" the color is yellow, which leads to another yellow. If the previous word is ""lug,"" which correlates to blue, ""walm"" also results in blue. If placed after ""wif,"" which outputs red, ""walm"" repeats red.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word.",0.8,14,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns in the examples provided. When the word ""walm"" appears, the color that is outputted appears to replicate the previous color mentioned. 

Let's review the examples:

1. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   Here, ""walm"" directly follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" Therefore, after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated.

2. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   ""Walm"" directly follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" Therefore, after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated once before the sequence moves on to the next color.

3. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Again, ""walm"" directly follows ""wif,"" resulting in an additional ""red."" Later, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" leading to an additional ""yellow.""

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   ""Walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), leading to a repetition of ""yellow.""

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), leading to a repetition of ""blue.""

From these examples, we can deduce the rule surrounding the use of ""walm"":

Rule: ""Walm"" causes the color that is associated with the previous word to be repeated in the output.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color that precedes this word.",0.8,14,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: When the example contains ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""",1.0,15,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: Each instance of the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.",1.0,15,lug
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" appears to correspond to the color ""blue"" consistently. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,15,lug
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,15,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,15,lug
"Rule: dax -> green

Rule: dax -> green,1.0,15,dax
"From the examples given, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" All instances of ""dax"" in the input result in ""green"" in the output. There does not appear to be any additional context that changes the meaning of ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,15,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,15,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the provided examples.",1.0,15,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" has a consistent meaning regardless of its position in the input sequence. Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red."" The context around ""wif"" does not seem to change its meaning, as seen in the singular examples and when it is surrounded by other nonces. 

However, there may also be rules for the other nonce words like ""dax"" and ""bluf,"" since their presence in a string seems to correspond to specific colors as well; ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow."" To maintain focus on the word ""wif,"" we will not explore these potential rules further as the task only asks for the meaning of ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule I can induce from the examples given is:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" 

Thus:

wif -> meaning. Meaning is the color ""red.""",1.0,15,wif
"Based on the examples provided, wif consistently translates to red. There is no change in this translation across examples and there is no context provided that alters the meaning of wif. Therefore, the rule can be established as follows:

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the given context.",1.0,15,wif
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of the nonce word ""zup"" in the examples corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""",1.0,15,zup
"Based on the provided examples, each occurrence of ""zup"" consistently results in the word ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, we can deduce:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,15,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,15,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the output color corresponding to the nonce word ""zup"" is consistently yellow. There is no variation in its output regardless of its position or the other words around it. Therefore, the meaning of ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,15,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following pattern: each time the word ""zup"" appears, the corresponding output color is ""yellow."" This consistency across all examples suggests that ""zup"" translates directly to ""yellow,"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words. 

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,15,zup
"bluf -> green

Rule: Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green,"" regardless of the context or position of ""bluf"" in the input sequence.",1.0,15,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the word ""green"" when it translates to the output. However, it is important to note that ""bluf"" sometimes corresponds to ""blue"" as well. The rule seems context-dependent, specifically related to the words that precede it.

From the examples:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" or ""dax,"" it corresponds to ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" follows any word other than ""lug"" or ""dax,"" it corresponds to ""green.""

Rule: If ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" or ""dax"", then bluf -> blue. In any other context, bluf -> green.",1.0,15,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that follows the word ""dax"" in the previous instance within the same sequence. In the absence of a preceding ""dax,"" ""bluf"" defaults to the color that follows ""wif."" Here’s how it works based on the examples:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" appears twice after ""lug"" and ""zup,"" neither of which has an assigned color. Yet, because the word ""dax"" precedes the first ""bluf"" occurrence (and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""), the first ""bluf"" translates to ""blue,"" as does the second ""bluf,"" following the suit.

2. In the second example, ""bluf"" follows immediately after ""dax"" and thus takes on the color ""green.""

3. Similarly, in the third example, the presence of ""dax"" before ""bluf"" means that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" but since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" does not take its color from ""zup,"" and there's no ""dax"" before it, it's assumed that ""bluf"" here is defaulting to the color that follows ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

5. The fifth example again illustrates that ""bluf"" takes on the color ""green,"" which is the color associated with ""dax"" preceding it.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> the color associated with ""dax"" prior to ""bluf"" appearing in the sequence; if there is no preceding ""dax,"" it defaults to the color following ""wif.""",0.8,15,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe the following:

- In the first input, ""bluf"" appears twice, and in the output, ""blue"" corresponds to it each time.
- In the second and third inputs, ""bluf"" appears at the end, and in the output, ""green"" appears at the same position.
- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" appears after a repeating sequence of ""wif dax zup"", and the corresponding output for ""bluf"" is ""green"".

From these observations, we can induce that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"" when following the word ""dax"". However, when it does not follow ""dax"", such as in the first and fourth examples, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be: ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" by default, but to ""green"" if it immediately follows the word ""dax"".

Rule: bluf -> blue by default, green if following ""dax"".",0.8,15,bluf
"bluf -> green

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green in the outputs given.",0.6,15,bluf
Rule: walm -> repeat the last color mentioned three times.,1.0,15,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it. In each instance, ""walm"" generates a repeated series of the color corresponding to the word prior to it.

Here's the breakdown:

1. In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it produces ""yellow yellow.""
2. In the second example, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue blue.""
3. The third example is similar; ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and is followed by ""walm,"" which again leads to ""yellow yellow.""
4. In the fourth example, ""wif"" means ""red,"" so ""walm"" after ""wif"" yields ""red red.""
5. Finally, in the last example, ""lug"" represents ""blue,"" and after ""walm"" we also have ""blue blue.""

So the rule for ""walm"": 

Rule: walm repeats the output color of the word that comes immediately before it. 

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,15,walm
"Analyzing the examples:

- For each instance when ""walm"" is used, the output corresponds to a repetition of the color word that comes just before it. Here's the breakdown:
  - Example 1: ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow""; ""zup"" means yellow, so ""walm"" repeats the preceding color thrice.
  - Example 2: ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue""; ""lug"" means blue, so ""walm"" repeats the preceding color thrice.
  - Example 3: ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"", which is the same pattern as before.
  - Example 4: ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red""; ""wif"" means red, so ""walm"" repeats the preceding color thrice.
  - Example 5: ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue""; again, ""lug"" as blue before ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated thrice.

Walm -> meaning. Rule:
Walm repeats the color word immediately before it three times.",1.0,15,walm
"walm -> repeats the color of the previous word

Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears in the sequence, its output color is repeated as many times as the color of the word that comes immediately before ""walm"".",1.0,15,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can look at each instance where it occurs and the corresponding outputs.

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is three yellows. 
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is four blues. 
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is three reds.
- When ""walm"" stands alone after ""lug,"" the output is two blues.
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" and followed by ""zup"" and ""lug,"" we see blue twice followed by the expected sequence for ""zup lug.""

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" may repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it two more times. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" may be that it repeats the color corresponding to the previous word two additional times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word two more times.",1.0,15,walm

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the output color correlates directly with the position of the word in the input. Specifically, when ""dax"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is ""green,"" and the output's position matches that of ""dax.""

Here is the rule I have induced:

- ""dax"" in the first position results in ""green"" in the first position.
- ""dax"" in the second position results in ""green"" in the second position.
- ""dax"" by itself still gives an output of ""green.""
  
Therefore, it seems that ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input.

"dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,16,dax
"From the given examples, we can infer that the word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color 'green' regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule we can derive from this is:

dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color green.",1.0,16,dax
"From the given examples, we can infer a rule based on the positions of ""dax"" and the corresponding color output:

1. When ""dax"" appears first, the output is green.
2. When ""dax"" appears in any other position, the output is still green.

From this, we can deduce that the position of ""dax"" within the sequence does not matter; it always corresponds to green. Therefore,

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,16,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently leads to the output ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. When ""dax"" is the sole word in the input, the output remains ""green.""

Rule: wif -> red,1.0,16,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""",1.0,16,wif
"To deduce the meaning of zup, we need to analyze the patterns in which it appears and the corresponding output.

1. In every example where ""zup"" appears, the output includes the color ""yellow"".
2. The occurrence of ""zup"" and the number of times ""yellow"" appears in the output corresponds one-to-one.

Based on the examples provided:

- ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue""; the first ""yellow"" seems to correspond to ""zup"".
- ""zup wif lug"" translates to ""yellow red blue"", with ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup"".
- ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow"", with the second ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup"".
- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""; the first and third ""yellow"" correspond to each occurrence of ""zup"".
- ""zup walm lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue"", where the first ""yellow"" corresponds to ""zup"".

Based on this analysis, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" is consistent across all examples:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Whenever ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, it translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,16,zup
"Rule:

Analyzing the given examples, it's noticeable that the presence of ""zup"" in a sequence always results in ""yellow"" in the corresponding output. The word does not seem to affect the color associated with the other words (lug, walm, dax, wif, and bluf) in the output sequence. Each of these other words consistently translates into a specific color regardless of the position or combination:

- ""wif"" consistently results in ""red""
- ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue""
- ""walm"" seems to imply ""yellow"" except when combined with ""zup""
- ""dax"" consistently results in ""green""
- ""bluf"" seems to always result in ""yellow.""

Therefore, we can deduce that in this context, ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,16,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look for patterns in each instance where the word appears:

1. ""zup wif walm lug"" produces ""yellow red red red blue."" ""wif"" could signify ""red,"" ""walm"" could signify ""red,"" and ""lug"" could signify ""blue,"" because they correspond in the given examples.

2. ""zup wif lug"" produces ""yellow red blue."" This is consistent with the idea that ""wif"" means ""red"" and ""lug"" means ""blue.""

3. ""dax zup bluf"" produces ""green yellow yellow."" ""dax"" appears to signify ""green."" ""bluf"" does not have a clear meaning yet, but ""zup"" seems to signify ""yellow"" given its position between two known values.

4. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" produces ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" If we assume ""lug"" means ""blue,"" ""walm"" means ""red,"" and ""dax"" means ""green,"" then ""zup"" would mean ""yellow.""

5. ""zup walm lug"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" Since previously we have associated ""walm"" with ""red,"" the output does not match unless ""zup"" has a repetitive nature, meaning ""zup"" preceding ""walm"" turns ""walm"" into ""yellow"" instead of ""red.""

From these examples, we can deduce that ""zup"" directly corresponds with the color ""yellow."" However, in combination with ""walm,"" it seems that ""walm"" gets affected and outputs ""yellow"" instead of its usual ""red."" Since the available examples always translate ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position, we can conclude that the primary meaning of ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,16,zup
"To figure out the rule for what ""zup"" means, let's look for patterns in the given examples:

In examples where ""zup"" is used:
1. ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue""
2. ""zup wif lug"" -> ""yellow red blue""
3. ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""
4. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""
5. ""zup walm lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue""

Looking at the outputs associated with ""zup"":

- In examples 1, 4, and 5, every instance of ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", regardless of the surrounding words.
- In example 2,  ""zup"" precedes ""wif lug"" and again translates to ""yellow"" followed by ""red blue"".
- In example 3, ""zup"" follows ""dax"" and is translated to ""yellow"", with ""bluf"" following and translating to another ""yellow"".

The common denominator in these examples is that each ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow"" in the output, irrespective of the words that follow or precede it.

Rule: ""zup"" -> ""yellow""",1.0,16,zup
"From observing the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""zup"" by looking at the pattern of inputs and outputs.

1. The first and fifth examples show that ""zup wif walm lug"" results in ""yellow red red red blue,"" and ""zup walm lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" We can notice that the presence of ""wif"" changes the color pattern in the sequence.

2. In the second example, ""zup wif lug"" translates to ""yellow red blue."" Comparing this with the first example, it appears ""wif"" causes a ""red"" to appear after ""yellow.""

3. The third example, ""dax zup bluf,"" results in ""green yellow yellow."" Here, ""dax"" precedes ""zup"" and the output starts with ""green,"" suggesting ""dax"" may correspond to ""green."" Additionally, ""bluf"" following ""zup"" does not affect the color ""yellow.""

4. The fourth example features ""zup"" multiple times: ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf."" The output is ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" ""Zup"" preceding ""lug"" yields ""yellow blue,"" while ""zup"" followed by ""walm"" or occurring by itself corresponds to ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, we can infer the following:
- ""zup"" on its own seems to translate to ""yellow.""
- ""wif,"" when used after ""zup,"" results in ""red"" following the ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup.""
- ""lug"" after ""zup"" corresponds to ""blue,"" although this might also be influenced by whether ""wif"" or ""walm"" is present.
- ""walm"" alters the output, making the ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup"" repeat based on its position (though we may need more examples to fully understand its rule).

Therefore, considering the information above, we can tentatively define the rule as:
Rule: ""zup"" typically corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" but the output can vary depending on the words following ""zup.""",0.8,16,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that precedes it:

- In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""bluf"" also results in green.
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" also results in red.
- In ""lug wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and the next ""bluf"" also results in red.
- In the other instances of ""bluf,"" it always takes the color of the word right before it.

So, it appears that the rule is:

bluf -> meaning: The word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the word immediately prior to it.

Rule: If X represents a color word, then the pattern ""X bluf"" translates to ""color(color of X) color(color of X)"".",1.0,16,bluf

2. ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green"" (""bluf"" mimics ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"")

5. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" (""bluf"" mimics ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"")

Rule: bluf -> mimics the color of the preceding word.",1.0,16,bluf
"From the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" appears to mirror the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the pattern observed from the given examples:

1. In ""dax bluf wif"" -> ""green green red,"" the word ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color green, and so ""bluf"" also gives the output green.

2. When ""zup dax bluf"" is given as input, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and since ""dax"" corresponds to green, the word ""bluf"" also results in green.

3. In ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" the first time and outputs red, which is the same color associated with ""wif."" The second time ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and it outputs blue, which corresponds with ""lug.""

4. ""dax bluf"" yields ""green green,"" reinforcing the rule that ""bluf"" adopts the color of the word immediately before it in the sequence.

5. ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" which again demonstrates that ""bluf"" takes the color corresponding to the preceding word, which in this case is ""wif,"" associated with the color red.

Rule: bluf -> mirrors the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,16,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

In the examples given, whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, the output is the color that corresponds to the word that comes directly before ""bluf"". For instance, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"" because the color for ""dax"" is green and is repeated because ""bluf"" follows it. Similarly, ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red"" since the color associated with ""wif"" is red and is duplicated as ""bluf"" comes after.",1.0,16,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word that directly follows ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with that word when it is said before ""bluf."" Here are the associations we can see from the examples:

- When ""wif"" follows ""bluf,"" the output is red, which is the color assigned to ""wif.""
- When ""dax"" follows ""bluf,"" the output is green, which is the color assigned to ""dax.""
- The output for ""bluf"" by itself is not given, but it appears to repeat the color of the word it reflects.

So the rule seems to be:

bluf -> Repeat the color of the following word.

Rule: When ""bluf"" is immediately followed by another word, the color output for ""bluf"" will be the same as the color associated with the following word. If ""bluf"" is the last word or is not followed by an identifiable color-coded word, the rule cannot be determined from the given examples. The only consistent pattern is when ""bluf"" is directly followed by a word that has a color association.",0.8,16,bluf
"Based on the examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color word that would represent the word immediately before ""walm."" We see that when ""walm"" follows a ""lug,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" ""red"" is repeated three times. Likewise, when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times. Therefore, the pattern is that ""walm"" causes the preceding color name to be outputted three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word before ""walm"" three times.",1.0,16,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs and compare them with the presence of ""walm"" in the inputs. First, observe the patterns and how the output colors are associated with the input words. 

In every instance:

- ""lug"" is followed by three ""blue"" in the output.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""wif"" leads to three ""red"" in the output.
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow.""

Every time ""walm"" appears in the input, it is preceded by a different word, which then repeats color in the output three times. It could be that ""walm"" means ""repeat the color of the preceding word three times.""

Let's look at how ""walm"" affects the output:

1. ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""blue"" repeated three times.
   
2. ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green."" Here we see the effect of ""walm"" repeating the ""blue"" three times plus the green for ""dax."" 

3. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" corresponds to ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow."" In this case, ""wif"" comes before the first ""walm"" and its color ""red"" is repeated three times. Then ""zup"" comes after the second ""walm,"" and its color, ""yellow,"" is repeated three times.

4. ""wif walm dax zup"" gives ""red red red green yellow."" Before ""walm,"" we have ""wif,"" which gets repeated as ""red"" three times.

5. ""wif walm zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" In this case, ""wif"" comes before the first ""walm"" and is repeated as ""red"" three times, while ""zup"" comes before the second ""walm"" and is repeated as ""yellow"" three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,16,walm
"walm -> three repetitions of the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is used, it triggers the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it, three times in succession.",1.0,16,walm
"Based on the provided input and output examples, we can see that each time the nonce word walm is used, a sequence of the same word is produced in the output. Each word in the input corresponds to a specific color word in the output: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

When walm is present following any of these words, the output color of that word is repeated three times. For example, after ""lug walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue."" This pattern holds in the other examples as well. 

Thus, we can induce that walm causes the color immediately produced before it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> the color word before it is repeated three times.",1.0,16,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine its correlation with the outputs in the given examples.

1. When ""lug walm"" is input, the output is ""blue blue blue."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to a single occurrence of ""blue,"" the additional ""blue blue"" might be a result of ""walm.""

2. When ""lug walm dax"" is input, the output is ""blue blue blue green."" ""Dax"" corresponds to a single ""green,"" so the ""blue blue blue"" part still seems associated with ""lug"" and ""walm.""

3. For ""dax wif walm lug zup walm,"" the output is ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow."" ""Lug"" is again followed by three ""blue,"" but ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" and before ""zup,"" and both times corresponds to three ""red"" and three ""yellow,"" respectively.

4. With ""wif walm dax zup,"" the output is ""red red red green yellow."" Here ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" and ""dax"" and ""zup"" correspond to ""green"" and ""yellow,"" respectively.

5. Finally, ""wif walm zup walm"" results in ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" After ""wif,"" ""walm"" is again followed by ""red red red,"" and when followed by ""zup,"" ""walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

We can see a pattern where ""walm"" seems to triple the color that comes before it. When it immediately follows ""lug,"" ""walm"" triples the color blue; when it follows ""wif,"" it triples red; and when it follows ""zup,"" it triples yellow. There are no examples given with ""walm"" directly following ""dax,"" but we could infer that it would potentially triple green, following the observed pattern.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each unique word in the input corresponds to a unique color in the output. The output colors follow the order in which the words are presented in the input.

Let's examine the occurrences of ""dax"" and the consistent output color:

- Every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is always ""green.""
- Regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the sequence or the words that come before or after it, the output color associated with it doesn't change.

This leads to a straightforward rule:

"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" can be determined to translate to the color ""red"". In each instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output, regardless of the position of ""wif"" or the context around it.

Therefore, the rule is:

Each instance of ""wif"" in the input shows a corresponding ""red"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""wif"" within the input sequence.

"Rule: zup -> yellow. 

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow"".",1.0,17,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""zup,"" I will compare the inputs and corresponding outputs:

- When ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" is the input, the output is ""blue green green yellow blue red,"" and when ""zup lug"" is the input, the output is ""yellow blue."" This indicates that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

- The word ""zup"" precedes ""lug"" in ""zup lug,"" resulting in ""yellow blue,"" so we can infer that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Similarly, ""zup"" precedes different words in each of the different outputs, and ""yellow"" is the only consistent color before the colors corresponding to those words.

- In every instance where ""zup"" is in the input, ""yellow"" is in the output sequence exactly where ""zup"" appears in the input sequence, regardless of the position or terms around it.

Therefore, we can deduce that:

Rule: zup -> yellow. ""Zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs provided.",1.0,17,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" correlates to the color ""red."" To verify this, we can look at the input-output pairs:

- When ""bluf"" appears alone with ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow""), the output is ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" does not impact the output of ""zup.""
- When ""bluf"" is combined with ""wif"" or ""lug"" which correspond to ""blue,"" the output contains additional instances of the color that ""wif"" or ""lug"" represents, followed by the color ""red."" This pattern suggests that ""bluf"" triggers duplication followed by ""red,"" although it’s important to notice that when ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" and ""lug,"" there are double ""blue"" and double ""red"" in the output as seen in Example 3.

However, on closer inspection of all examples, it seems that ""bluf"" always produces ""red"" in the output, often affecting the sequence according to its position—a rule that might involve the duplication of colors that precede it. But without more context or additional examples, the simplest direct correlation can be drawn from the appearance of ""red"" in the output each time ""bluf"" is present in the input.

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,17,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at the patterns of inputs and their corresponding outputs. By comparing the inputs with the outputs, we might be able to infer the rule underlying ""bluf.""

- In the first example (wif lug zup bluf), ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""yellow."" 

- In the second example (zup bluf), both instances of ""zup"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""yellow,"" which further supports the initial observation.

- However, in the third example (lug walm wif bluf), we see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" is not present in the output, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that precedes it.

- Similarly, in the fourth example (zup wif bluf), ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red."" Again, ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it, which means ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

- Finally, in the fifth example (zup wif bluf zup lug), we see the same pattern: ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" and as before, it corresponds to ""red.""

From these observations, we can deduce a rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color value of the word that precedes it.",1.0,17,bluf
"From the given examples, let's deduce the meaning of ""bluf"":

1. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow
2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
3. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
4. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
5. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
   Output: yellow red red yellow blue

Based on these examples, we notice that ""bluf"" at the end of an input results in a repeated color from the output. Specifically, it seems to repeat the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it:

1. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when ""bluf"" follows, the output is ""yellow"" again.
2. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and when ""bluf"" follows, the output is ""red"" again.
3. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and when ""bluf"" follows, the output is ""blue"" again.

Additionally, in the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and it results in ""red red,"" which corresponds to ""wif bluf."" In this case, ""bluf"" is not at the end of the sequence, indicating that its repeating capability is associated with the position directly before it and not necessarily at the end of the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> The ""bluf"" repeats the color that corresponds to the word directly before it in the sequence.",1.0,17,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to correspond to the color ""red"" each time it is used.

The output always matches the sequential color representation of the input words.

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,17,bluf
"From the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the word ""red"", but repeating as many times as the previous word in the sequence. The rules seem to be that ""wif"" translates to ""red"", ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it.

Here are the patterns observed:

- ""wif lug zup bluf"": red blue yellow yellow (bluf repeats the color of ""zup"")
- ""zup bluf"": yellow yellow (bluf repeats the color of ""zup"")
- ""lug walm wif bluf"": blue blue blue red red (bluf repeats the color of ""wif"" twice because ""wif"" occurred after two ""walm""s, which is missing in the output but seems to result in a repeat of the previous color)
- ""zup wif bluf"": yellow red red (bluf repeats the color of ""wif"")
- ""zup wif bluf zup lug"": yellow red red yellow blue (bluf repeats the color of ""wif"")

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word as many times as it appears in sequence. If the previous word does not appear in sequence, bluf represents a single instance of that color.",0.8,17,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of the color that is mentioned immediately before the word ""walm."" Each instance of ""walm"" follows a color, and the output is that color repeated multiple times. 

Here are the observations:

1. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the color red three times.
2. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""green red yellow yellow red red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the preceding color red again three times.
3. ""wif dax lug walm"" translates to ""red green blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the color blue three times.
4. ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the color yellow three times, with another word for blue after it.
5. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" repeats yellow three times without any additional color name intervening.

Therefore, the general rule appears to be:

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""walm"" means to repeat the immediately preceding color word three times.",1.0,17,walm
"walm -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to repeatedly correspond with the color red being repeated three times.

1. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow red red red.""
2. When ""walm"" follows ""bluf wif,"" the output is ""yellow red red red"" added to the sequence ""green red yellow.""
3. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
4. When ""walm"" follows ""lug zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" where ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
5. When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" alone, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

From these examples, we can see that ""walm"" produces a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" repeats the last color stated three times.

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look for patterns and correlations between the position of ""dax"" in the input and the output colors:

1. In the first example, ""dax"" appears first followed by ""zup"" and then again before ""bluf."" The corresponding colors are ""green yellow"" and ""green green."" It seems like the appearance of ""dax"" once corresponds to a green color in the output.

2. In the second example, ""lug dax"" corresponds to ""blue green."" Since ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue,"" ""dax"" must correspond to ""green.""

3. In the third example, ""lug walm dax"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue green."" If we consider ""lug"" to be ""blue,"" then ""walm"" might be adding more ""blue"" based on its position before ""dax,"" leading ""dax"" again to correspond to ""green.""

4. In the fourth example, ""dax walm lug"" corresponds to ""green green green blue."" Here, ""dax"" translation to ""green"" is consistent.

5. In the fifth example, ""lug dax walm"" corresponds to ""blue green green green,"" with ""lug"" as ""blue"" and the following ""dax walm"" resulting in ""green green green,"" which shows a consistent pattern for ""dax.""

From these examples, it's clear that no matter where ""dax"" appears, it consistently corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,18,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can infer a rule for what ""dax"" represents. 

From the outputs we observe, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the word ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Compare the first position of both input and output in all examples:

- ""wif dax"" consistently leads to ""red green""
- ""lug dax"" leads to ""blue green""
- Even when ""dax"" shifts position, like in ""dax walm lug,"" it still corresponds to ""green"" in the output

So, in this case, we can confidently deduce the rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,18,dax
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" It appears that ""wif"" is not influenced by the context or position within the input sequence. Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" is as follows:

"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's observe its output in each example provided:

1. wif -> red

2. lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> blue blue red blue blue yellow
   Here, ""wif"" is associated with the color red, while ""lug"" and ""bluf"" are mapped to blue, and ""zup"" is mapped to yellow.
  
3. dax zup walm wif walm -> green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   Here, ""wif"" occurs after ""walm"" resulting in a sequence of reds equal to the number of times ""walm"" occurs before it plus one. ""dax"" is green and ""zup"" is yellow.
  
4. dax bluf wif zup dax -> green green red yellow green
   ""wif"" leads to just a single red, while ""dax"" remains consistently green and ""zup"" is consistently yellow.

5. dax lug wif lug -> green blue red blue
   Again, ""wif"" results in a red, ""dax"" is green, and ""lug"" is blue.

From the observations above, the most consistent rule for ""wif"" is that it translates to the color red consistently.

"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to represent a color that repeats a preceding color. We can deduce its meaning by looking at the color repetition patterns in each example:

- In the first example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red blue blue"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which represents ""blue"", and thus ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" repeated twice.

- In the second example, ""dax walm lug"" translates to ""green green green blue"". ""Walm"" follows ""dax"", which represents ""green"", and ""walm"" results in two additional ""green"" elements.

- In the third example, ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" is ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"". ""Walm"" follows ""zup"", which represents ""yellow"", and ""walm"" results in three more ""yellow"" elements after the initial ""zup"".

- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" is ""yellow yellow red red red"". ""Walm"" follows ""wif"", which represents ""red"", and ""walm"" results in two extra ""red"" elements.

- The fifth example, ""zup walm"", translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"". With ""walm"" following ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", it generates two more ""yellow"" elements.

To summarize, ""walm"" seems to mean repeating the color immediately preceding it. The number of repetitions varies depending on the example, but each time ""walm"" appears to add at least two more instances of the preceding color to the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color represented by the preceding word two or more times.",1.0,18,walm
"From the examples provided, we can induce that ""walm"" repeats the color notation of the word that comes directly before it. When there's one word before ""walm,"" the output is three repetitions, while if ""walm"" comes after two different words, the output is two repetitions of the color specified by the second word. Let's break down each example to illustrate this pattern:

- lug walm wif lug bluf - Here, the ""lug"" preceding ""walm"" corresponds with blue, thus ""walm"" repeats the color blue three times (since it is the color associated with the word right before ""walm"").
- dax walm lug - ""Dax"" is associated with green, so ""walm"" repeats this color three times.
- zup bluf lug zup walm - ""Zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the color associated with ""zup"" is yellow. Since it directly precedes ""walm,"" ""walm"" here represents three yellows after a sequence including ""zup.""
- zup bluf wif walm - ""Wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and its associated color is red, so ""walm"" repeats red twice (since there are two different words before ""walm"").
- zup walm - Follows the initial rule where ""zup"" is associated with yellow and hence ""walm"" repeats yellow three times.

Given this analysis, the rule we can induct is:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning is the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. If ""walm"" follows one word, it will be repeated three times, but if it follows two different words, the color is repeated twice.

Let's confirm this rule by applying it to the provided examples:

1. lug walm wif lug bluf -> Blue is associated with ""lug"": blue blue blue.
2. dax walm lug -> Green is associated with ""dax"": green green green.
3. zup bluf lug zup walm -> Yellow is associated with ""zup"": yellow yellow yellow.
4. zup bluf wif walm -> Red is associated with ""wif"": red red red.
5. zup walm -> Yellow is associated with ""zup"": yellow yellow yellow.

This rule accurately predicts the outputs based on the provided inputs, indicating that our induction of the meaning of ""walm"" is correct.",1.0,18,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each example and the corresponding outputs to identify patterns.

From the first example:
- Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
- Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Here, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" so ""lug"" becomes blue. ""Wif"" follows ""walm,"" which turns to red, then a lone ""lug"" turns to blue, and ""bluf"" turns to blue as well. It seems that ""walm"" causes the following word to repeat the color of the word preceding ""walm."" In this case, ""walm"" results in repeating ""blue.""

From the second example:
- Input: dax walm lug
- Output: green green green blue

""Dax"" is translated as green and is followed by ""walm."" ""Lug"" after ""walm"" becomes green, which again matches the color of the word before ""walm."" Thus, ""walm"" causes the word following it to repeat the color of the word before it, which in this case is green.  

From the third example:
- Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
- Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" is blue, ""lug"" is blue, and another ""zup"" which remains yellow. ""Walm"" comes after this ""zup"" and it is followed by yellow again, repeating the color of the word that came before it.

From the fourth example:
- Input: zup bluf wif walm
- Output: yellow yellow red red red

In this sequence, ""zup"" becomes yellow, ""bluf"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" results in the following word (""wif"") being repeated as red.

From the fifth example:
- Input: zup walm
- Output: yellow yellow yellow

There is only ""zup"" before ""walm,"" which is yellow, and after ""walm,"" it remains yellow which supports the repetition rule.

From these patterns, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the word following it to take on the color of the word that precedes ""walm."" 

Rule: walm -> causes repetition of the color represented by the preceding word in a sequence.",1.0,18,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we examine how the output changes when ""walm"" appears in the input. We'll look at the examples provided and compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs to identify the pattern.

1. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   - ""lug"" correlates to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" correlates to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" correlates to ""blue""
   - When ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" all following words until a different word (""wif"") are also ""blue.""

2. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
   - ""dax"" correlates to ""green""
   - ""lug"" correlates to ""blue""
   - When ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" it continues to be ""green"" until a different word (""lug"") appears, which changes the output to ""blue.""

3. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" and ""lug"" correlate to ""blue""
   - After ""zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow,"" and it remains ""yellow"" until a different word interrupts the pattern.

4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" correlates to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" correlates to ""red""
   - When ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" the output is ""red,"" which continues to be ""red"" until a different word would appear to interrupt the pattern.

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow""
   - When ""walm"" appears after ""zup,"" the output continues to be ""yellow.""

Based on the outputs in these examples, ""walm"" appears to replicate the color of the word that precedes it until a different word is encountered. Therefore:

Rule: walm -> replicates the color of the preceding word until a different word is encountered.",1.0,18,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", we should look at the patterns in the inputs and outputs:

- When ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" (blue), the output is ""blue blue blue"".
- When ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" (green), the output is ""green green green"".
- When ""walm"" comes on its own or after ""zup"" (yellow), the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- When ""walm"" comes after ""bluf"" (blue) and ""wif"" (red), the output is ""red red red"".

From this, it appears that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color word immediately preceding it, repeated three times.

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that each instance of a word corresponds to a specific color in the output. Observing the outputs following each input, we can try to deduce the color associated with ""dax"" by looking for a consistent pattern.

In example 1:
""Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green"" in the output.

In example 2:
""Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax

- ""dax"" is at the beginning and the first color in the output is ""green.""

In example 4:
""Input: dax

And in example 5:
""Input: dax
Output: green""

Across all examples where ""dax"" is used, it correlates to ""green"" in the output sequence, regardless of its position in the input sequence. There is no example in which ""dax"" corresponds to any color other than green. Thus, we can induce the rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,19,dax

"To determine the meaning of the word ""zup,"" we need to look for patterns in the inputs and outputs presented in the examples.

- Input: zup dax walm zup wif

  Here, each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

- Input: zup lug zup wif dax

  Yet again, both instances of ""zup"" correspond to ""yellow.""

- Input: lug zup
  Output: blue yellow

  The final sample reconfirms the pattern that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Given these consistent results, the meaning of ""zup"" seems to correspond with the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding context. Therefore:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,19,zup

Therefore, the rule is:

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow.""

So the rule is: zup -> yellow.",1.0,19,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""blue"" when it's mentioned. However, it also appears to prompt the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it represents the color ""blue"" and also causes the previous color word to be repeated.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the previous color and follow with ""blue"".",1.0,19,bluf

2. When preceded by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" the presence of ""bluf"" results in repeating ""red.""

If bluf stands alone with no preceding word, there is no color to repeat, so the output for bluf alone is just ""yellow"", which seems to be the default output color without further context from the examples provided.",0.8,19,bluf
Rule: bluf -> blue,0.6,19,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, walm seems to take on the color that is associated with the preceding word. To confirm this, we can analyze the Outputs associated with each Input:

1. In ""wif dax zup walm"", walm comes after ""zup"", and the corresponding Output color is ""yellow."" In this instance, ""zup"" appears to be associated with yellow, as evident from the third example ""wif walm zup"", where ""zup"" once again corresponds to ""yellow."" 

2. In ""lug walm"", the Output is ""blue blue blue"", meaning that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" and walm takes on this blue color as well.

3. Rule induction for ""wif walm zup"" would suggest that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and since ""walm"" follows ""wif"" the output for ""walm"" is also ""red"" in this sequence.

4. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" supports the hypothesis again. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and when ""walm"" follows ""dax"", its corresponding color is ""green."" Similarly, when ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (""red"") and ""lug"" (""blue""), it takes on red and blue accordingly.

5. The instance ""zup lug walm wif dax"" further corroborates the rule, with ""walm"" following ""lug"" and the Output color being ""blue"" as expected.

Hence, the rule seems to be:

**Rule:** walm -> takes on the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,19,walm
"To determine the rule behind ""walm,"" let's examine the output pattern related to its presence in the input:

1. In the first example, ""wif dax zup walm,"" the output is ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output corresponding is consecutive ""yellow."" This suggests that ""walm"" might be influencing the repetition of the color related to the word preceding it.

2. The second example, ""lug walm,"" and its output, ""blue blue blue,"" shows that ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which is associated with the color ""blue"" in the input. The output has ""blue"" repeated three times, supporting the repetition rule suggested in the first example.

3. In the third example, ""wif walm zup,"" we have ""red red red yellow,"" where ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""zup."" ""Wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" The presence of ""walm"" this time results in the repetition of ""red,"" which is linked with ""wif.""

4. The fourth example, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm,"" gives us ""green green green red blue green green green."" ""Walm"" appears twice here, and in both cases, the color that follows it is repeated multiple times: after the first ""walm"" we get repeated ""green,"" and after the second, we again get repeated ""green.""

5. Lastly, the fifth example, ""zup lug walm wif dax,"" and its output, ""yellow blue blue blue red green,"" further shows ""walm"" coming after ""lug,"" with the subsequent output being ""blue"" repeated.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated three times. It is important to note that the repetitions include the instance of the color that would naturally follow the preceding word without the influence of ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to repeat a total of three times, including the normal occurrence.",1.0,19,walm
"Analyzing the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" affects the output based on the preceding word. Let's start by looking at the patterns:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", the output is red, matching the color associated with ""wif"".
   - Example: ""wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow""

2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the output is green, matching the output color for ""dax"".
   - Example: ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" -> ""green green green red blue green green green""

3. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the output is exclusively blue, no matter what word comes next.
   - Example: ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
   - Example: ""zup lug walm wif dax"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red green""

4. ""walm"" does not seem to produce a color on its own, but instead repeats the output color of the word that comes before it unless it is ""lug"", where it results in blue regardless of other color outputs associated with ""lug"".

Based on the information above, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:
walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word as the output, unless the preceding word is ""lug"", then the output is always blue.

Rule: If walm follows lug, it outputs blue. If it follows any other word, it replicates the color that would be output for the previous word.",0.9,19,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule applied to the nonce word ""walm."" Each example translates a sequence of nonce words into colors. The word ""walm"" appears in different positions across the examples, and is always followed by repetitions of a color, suggesting that ""walm"" indicates repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it.

In the first example, ""wif dax zup walm,"" the colors are ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" Since ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" seems to indicate that ""yellow"" should be repeated three times.

In the second example, ""lug walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" showing that the color ""blue,"" which corresponds to ""lug,"" is repeated three times, reinforcing the repetition rule of ""walm.""

The third example, ""wif walm zup,"" outputs ""red red red yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" caused ""red"" (the color for ""wif"") to be repeated three times, and then ""yellow"" corresponds to ""zup.""

The fourth example, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm,"" translates to ""green green green red blue green green green,"" which confirms the repetition rule. The word ""walm"" following ""dax"" leads to ""green"" being repeated three times, and when ""walm"" appears again after ""dax,"" ""green"" is repeated three times again.

The fifth example, ""zup lug walm wif dax,"" gives us ""yellow blue blue blue red green."" ""Walm"" comes after ""lug,"" which results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.

Rule: walm results in the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that precedes it.

walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",0.9,19,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we look at its corresponding output in each given example:

1. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   - The word ""walm"" corresponds to three occurrences of ""yellow.""

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - The word ""walm"" corresponds to three occurrences of ""blue.""

3. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   - The word ""walm"" corresponds to two occurrences of ""red.""

4. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   - The first ""walm"" corresponds to one occurrence of ""red,"" while the second ""walm"" corresponds to two occurrences of ""green.""

5. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   - The word ""walm"" corresponds to one occurrence of ""red.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" results in repetition of color words in the output. The color that is repeated is the one immediately prior to ""walm"" in the input. Based on the instances provided, the rule for how many times the color is repeated is not immediately clear. In most cases, ""walm"" produces a triplicate of the preceding color, but this is not consistent, as sometimes it results in only a single or double occurrence as in examples 3 and 4.

Given the lack of a clear consistent pattern in the number of repetitions, let's look at the positioning of ""walm"" relative to the other words:

- When ""walm"" is immediately preceded by ""wif,"" ""dax,"" or ""zup,"" these correspond to the colors red, green, and yellow, respectively. In these instances, ""walm"" results in repetitions of those colors in the output three times, except when it is preceded immediately by ""dax wif"" or ""zup wif,"" in which case the number of repetitions decreases.

- When ""walm"" is immediately preceded by ""lug,"" it appears that ""lug walm"" translates to three blue repeats. However, in example 5, ""lug walm"" results in a single ""red"" instead of ""blue.""

Based on these inconsistencies, drawing a conclusive rule for the exact behavior of ""walm"" is challenging. However, one potential rule to consider with the given data points is:

Rule: ""Walm"" causes the previous color word to repeat, typically three times, but can repeat a fewer number of times depending on the context or position of ""walm"" within the series of color words and non-color words, which is not fully determined by the given examples.

- In the second example, ""wif lug bluf"" becomes ""red blue blue,"" further suggesting that ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" and that the order is reversed since ""wif"" comes before ""lug bluf.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" on its own translates to ""red,"" reinforcing the idea that ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""blue red green green red blue,"" suggesting that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and supporting the reverse order pattern.
- In the fifth example, ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green,"" which indicates that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" when following ""wif.""

Considering this pattern, we can induce the following rule:

3. ""lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue green green""; ""bluf"" is green because it follows ""dax.""
4. Again, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green.""
5. ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red""; ""bluf"" is red because it follows ""wif.""

Rule: If ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" then it means ""green."" In all other cases, ""bluf"" means ""red."" 

Therefore:

3. lug dax bluf -> blue green green

It would seem that ""bluf"" means ""red,"" because whenever ""bluf"" is mentioned after ""wif"" or ""zup"", the output is ""red red"" or ""red"" respectively. This pattern also matches the first input where ""wif"" precedes and follows ""bluf"" resulted in ""red red."" However, in other cases where ""dax"" or ""lug"" precede ""bluf"", the output for ""bluf"" is ""green."" This inconsistency suggests that the meaning of ""bluf"" changes depending on the word that precedes it.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it. When ""wif"" (red) precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is also ""red.""

1. Input: zup lug walm wif dax

   In this case, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Since ""wif"" is not repeated in the examples, we won’t focus on it for this analysis. But ""walm"" results in three instances of ""blue"" following ""lug.""

2. Input: lug dax walm

   Here, ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" as established before. After ""dax,"" ""walm"" leads to three instances of ""green.""

3. Input: lug walm

   ""Lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" follows with two more instances of ""blue.""

4. Input: dax lug walm

   ""Dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue"" followed by ""walm,"" which leads to three instances of ""blue.""

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   The same as example 3.

Analyzing the above examples, we can conclude the following rule for ""walm"": it causes the repetition of the color word that directly precedes it, three times. 

Rule: walm -> When ""walm"" follows a color word, it repeats that word three times.",1.0,20,walm
"walm -> repeats the color of the word before it three times. Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, the output is three instances of the color that corresponds to the word that comes immediately before ""walm"".",1.0,20,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""walm"" produces a sequence of ""blue"" that corresponds to the number of times the word ""lug"" occurs before it, plus one. Each ""lug"" is translated to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to add another ""blue"" to that sequence. The word ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" but does not affect the sequence of blues generated by ""walm.""

Here is the induction based on the input-output pairs:

1. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red green""
   - ""lug"" contributes one ""blue""
   - ""walm"" adds two more ""blue"" (total of three blues in sequence)
   
2. ""lug dax walm"" -> ""blue green green green""
   - ""lug"" contributes one ""blue""
   - ""walm"" adds two more ""blue"", but the output has no additional ""blue."" We can infer that ""dax"" might change the output so the sequence of ""blue"" from ""walm"" is replaced with ""green.""

3. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
   - ""lug"" contributes one ""blue""
   - ""walm"" adds two more ""blue""

4. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
   - ""dax"" contributes one ""green""

   - ""walm"" adds two more ""blue""

5. ""lug walm"" (repeated input and output) confirms the consistency of the translation.

- ""bluf"" seems to trigger a repetition of the color that follows. This is evidenced by the ""bluf dax"" resulting in ""green green,"" and ""zup bluf dax"" ending with ""yellow yellow green.""

Now applying these rules to each example:

- ""zup lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue.""
- ""lug wif dax wif"" corresponds to ""blue"" for ""lug,"" then ""red green red"" for ""wif dax wif.""
- ""dax walm zup lug walm"" would be ""green"" followed by ""walm"" which we do not have a direct translation for, but assuming ""walm"" has a similar function to ""bluf"" as a repetition modifier but instead triples it, it would make ""green green green"" for ""dax walm,"" then ""yellow blue"" for ""zup lug,"" and finally ""blue blue blue"" for ""lug walm.""
- ""lug zup bluf dax"" would be ""blue yellow"" then ""green green"" for ""bluf dax.""

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

- In ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" has the color yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats the same color, yellow.

- In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" is associated with green, hence ""bluf"" repeats the color green.

"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to cause the output to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it. Each output has a series of the same color repeated for as many times as ""walm"" occurs in the input immediately after that word. Here are the observations in detail:

1. In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and ""walm"" causes the color red to be repeated.
2. In the second example, the pattern continues with ""wif walm"" resulting in ""red red red"" and then ""dax"" and ""zup"" introducing two new colors, green and yellow.
3. In the third example, ""dax"" is first and corresponds to green. Next, ""wif walm"" repeats the red color thrice. ""lug"" introduces blue, but then ""zup walm"" results in yellow being repeated thrice due to the presence of ""walm"" after ""zup"".
4. In the fourth example, ""zup walm dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green"" with ""walm"" causing the repetition of the color representing ""zup"" which is yellow.
5. Lastly, the fifth example shows ""lug dax walm"" translates to ""blue green green green,"" with ""walm"" making green (which corresponds to ""dax"") repeat.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color indicated by the previous word.,1.0,21,walm
"Given the examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color that is associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times. Let's analyze the examples to confirm this:

1. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and when ""walm"" follows, we see ""red"" repeated three times.

2. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

3. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   Here ""dax"" gives green, ""wif"" gives red which is then repeated three times due to ""walm"", ""lug"" produces blue, ""zup"" yields yellow, followed by another ""walm"" which causes the previous color (yellow) to be repeated three times.

4. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and the following ""walm"" leads to a triple yellow, followed by the green from ""dax"".

5. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green
   Here, ""lug"" gives blue, ""dax"" gives green and then ""walm"" causes the green to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.",1.0,21,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be translated to a repeated color. Specifically, ""walm"" is translated to the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. For example:

1. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red"" suggests that ""walm"" takes the color of ""wif"" which is red, and repeats it twice more, for a total of three times.
2. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow"" shows that ""walm"" after ""wif"" becomes ""red red red"", and ""walm"" after ""zup"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow"". 

Furthermore, each instance of ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the prior word as many times as the order in which ""walm"" appears in the sentence – first ""walm"" is repeated thrice, second ""walm"" is repeated thrice as well, which is consistent across all examples.

Thus, the rule seems to be: ""walm"" -> the color corresponding to the preceding word repeated as many times as the order of appearance of ""walm"" in the sentence.

Rule: ""walm"" translates to the color of the preceding word, repeated a number of times based on the instance count of ""walm"" in the sequence (e.g., first ""walm"" = three times, second ""walm"" = three times, and likely the pattern would continue with third ""walm"" = three times, and so on).",0.9,21,walm
"From the provided examples, we can infer a pattern based on the occurrence of the word ""walm"" and its translated output. 

1. Each occurrence of ""walm"" results in multiple ""red"" in the output.
2. The number of ""red"" in the output seems to be equal to the position of ""walm"" within the input sequence. For instance, when ""walm"" is the second word in the sequence, there are two occurrences of ""red"" in the output.

Now let's verify the rule using all the provided examples:
- In the first example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"". According to the rule, ""wif"" would translate to ""red"" and ""walm"" being second translates to two ""red"". This seems to be incorrect as there are three ""red"".
- In the second example, ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow"". According to our initial rule, ""wif"" should translate to ""red"", ""walm"" being the second word would translate to ""red red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". This fits the rule if we account for the extra ""red"" for ""walm"".
- In the third example, ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" translates to ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow"". ""Dax"" translates to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", ""walm"" being the third word would translate to ""red red red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and finally, the last ""walm"" being the sixth word translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"". This does not correspond with the initially proposed rule.
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green"". ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""walm"" being the second word would translate to ""yellow yellow"", and ""dax"" to ""green"". This doesn't correspond with the rule.
- In the fifth example, ""lug dax walm"" translates to ""blue green green green"". ""Lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""walm"" being the third word should translate to three repetitions of the color indicated by its position, which is ""green"". This fits our modified rule.

Considering the inconsistencies and after revisiting the examples, a new pattern emerges. Whenever ""walm"" is present, it seems to cause the following word's color to repeat based on its position in the sequence. Let's adjust the rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the next word's color to repeat a number of times equivalent to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence. If there is no word following ""walm"", it repeats the color ""red"" instead.

Using this adjusted rule:
- In the first example, there is no word after ""walm"", hence the triple ""red.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" is second, so it repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" twice.
- In the third example, the first ""walm"" is third, repeating the color ""blue"" thrice, and the second ""walm"" is sixth, repeating ""red"" six times since there is no word following it.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is second, so ""yellow"" repeats twice after the initial ""yellow"" from ""zup.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is third, repeating ""green"" three times after the initial ""green"" from ""dax.""

However, we still see an inconsistency with the third example, where the last ""walm"" does not follow this rule. But it's also the only example with more than one ""walm"" in the sequence. This might indicate an additional or alternative rule for subsequent occurrences of ""walm"" in a single input sequence. The rule may not hold when more than one ""walm"" appears.

Given that one example contradicts the adjusted rule, we may need additional examples or more context to determine a definitive rule for ""walm."" Pending further information, the most accurate rule we can surmise is the one provided above, with a note of the exception when multiple occurrences of ""walm"" are present.",0.8,21,walm

"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". In each example, whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the output includes the word ""green"". Here's the correspondence as shown in the examples:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" and so does ""dax"". Since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", we can isolate ""dax"" as equal to ""green"".
- In the second example, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""blue red green green red blue"", where ""dax"" aligns with the second ""green"" following the red corresponding to ""wif"".
- In the third example, only ""dax"" and ""zup"" are present, corresponding to ""green"" and ""yellow"", respectively.
- The fourth example, ""wif dax"", translates to ""red green"" where again ""dax"" is ""green"".

- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""

There is no example with 'zup' followed directly by 'bluf', but 'zup' is associated with the color yellow when followed by other words, suggesting that perhaps 'bluf' repeated the color of the previous word twice. 

Here's the deduction from the examples:

- 'wif' is followed by 'bluf', and the output is 'red red'.
- 'dax' is followed by 'bluf', and the output is 'green green'.
- When 'dax' and 'wif' are both present with 'bluf' in different combinations, 'bluf' always repeats the color corresponding to the previous word.
- The one instance where 'bluf' follows 'zup' does not give us a double color output, but since 'zup' precedes 'wif' and 'dax', it's possible it might not influence 'bluf' as they do, or there's not enough data to conclude how 'zup' affects 'bluf'.

Thus, the overall rule seems to be:

Rule: 'bluf' repeats the color associated with the preceding word twice. If 'wif' precedes 'bluf', then the output is 'red red'. If 'dax' precedes 'bluf', then the output is 'green green'. The influence of 'zup' on 'bluf' is uncertain with the given examples.",0.8,22,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates into ""red"" every time it is used, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it.

bluf -> red",0.0,22,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to indicate repetition of a color word that corresponds to the word preceding ""walm."" Here's how the rule plays out for each example:

- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"": Here ""lug"" likely means ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes this color to be repeated three times.
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"": Here ""dax"" likely means ""green,"" and again, ""walm"" causes this color to be repeated three times.
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green"": ""wif"" likely means ""red,"" ""bluf"" does not have a color associated with it and is ignored, ""dax"" means ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes the last color mentioned (""green"") to be repeated three times.
- ""wif walm zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow yellow yellow"": ""wif"" means ""red,"" the first ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times, ""zup"" likely means ""yellow,"" and the second ""walm"" makes ""yellow"" repeat three times.

Based on these examples, ""walm"" likely means to repeat the most recently mentioned color three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last stated color three times.",1.0,22,walm
"From the provided examples, walm seems to be associated with a repetition of color words in the outputs. Each instance of walm is followed by three repetitions of the same color word. Additionally, it appears that other words in the input determine which color is produced in relation to walm.

Here are the observations to derive the rule for walm:

- ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"" — so in this context, walm might mean ""triple blue.""
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" — suggesting that walm in this context might mean ""triple green.""
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" leads to ""red red green green green"" — indicating that ""wif bluf"" contributes to ""red red,"" and ""dax walm"" is still producing ""triple green.""
- ""wif walm zup walm"" results in ""red red red yellow yellow yellow"" — ""wif walm"" seems to produce ""triple red"" and ""zup walm"" leads to ""triple yellow.""

Since walm consistently corresponds to a triplet of a color, and that color changes based on the word preceding walm, we can deduce that walm means a sequence of three of a certain color which is determined by the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> A sequence of three repetitions of a color, where the specific color is indicated by the preceding word in the sequence.",1.0,22,walm
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to instruct the output to repeat the color associated with the word just before ""walm"" three times. Hence, we can derive the following associations:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", suggesting that ""lug"" means ""blue"".
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"", suggesting that ""dax"" means ""green"".
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green"", implying that ""wif"" means ""red"" and ""bluf"" has no effect on the output, likely because ""walm"" only interacts with the immediate word before it, which is ""dax"" here, meaning ""green"".
- ""wif walm zup walm"" results in ""red red red yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"", again implying that ""wif"" means ""red"". Then ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"", suggesting that ""zup"" means ""yellow"".

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" means to produce three instances of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,22,walm
"Observing the given examples, it notably appears that the word ""walm"" affects the output by repeating a color word three times. The specific color produced in the output seems to depend on the word that directly precedes ""walm."" Here's the pattern that the examples seem to follow:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" meaning when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it produces the word ""blue"" three times.
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" following ""dax"" produces the word ""green"" three times.
- In ""wif bluf dax walm,"" the output is ""red red green green green,"" which suggests that ""walm"" follows the rule of producing the color associated with the word before it three times; ""wif"" produces ""red red,"" ""bluf"" doesn't seem to affect the output (or there's no information on what ""bluf"" should produce), and ""dax"" before ""walm"" results in ""green green green.""
- ""wif walm zup walm"" results in ""red red red yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" following ""wif"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times and ""walm"" following ""zup"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times.

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" follows another word, it causes the corresponding color for that word to be repeated three times. If the corresponding color for a word is not evident, as seen with ""bluf,"" then that case does not provide enough information to determine the output. It is possible that ""bluf"" does not have an associated color or is an exception to the rule in some way.

Therefore:

walm -> Repeats the color associated with the previous word three times in the output.",0.9,22,walm
"To deduce what ""walm"" means in this context, we need to look at the patterns between the inputs and outputs:

1. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
   This suggests that ""lug"" and ""walm"" are both connected to ""blue"" in some way, particularly because ""blue"" is repeated three times.

2. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
   Similarly to the first example, ""dax"" and ""walm"" appear to be connected to ""green,"" which is also repeated three times.

3. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
   Here, we have different words resulting in different colors. ""wif"" and ""bluf"" result in ""red red,"" while ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" followed by ""walm,"" which seems to extend the number of ""green"" outputs.

4. ""wif walm zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow yellow yellow""
   Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" but now the presence of ""walm"" seems to have a multiplying effect on the color paired with the word just before it. ""Zup"" results in ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" seems to extend the sequence of ""yellow""s.

5. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
   This is a repetition of the first example and confirms the pattern seen so far.

Based on the patterns, ""walm"" seems to act as a word that multiplies the color associated with the preceding word, resulting in that color being repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> triplicates the color corresponding to the preceding word.",0.9,22,walm
"Based on the examples provided:

- The phrase ""zup dax lug"" translates to ""yellow green blue"", which includes ""lug"" translating to ""blue"" as part of the sequence.
- The phrase ""dax lug"" translates to ""green blue"", again with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"".

"Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be dependent on the context of the words that come before and after it. To deduce the rule, let us look at the color output whenever ""bluf"" is mentioned:

1. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
2. dax bluf wif zup wif -> green green red yellow red
3. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
4. zup wif bluf zup lug -> yellow red red yellow blue
5. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow

Each time ""bluf"" is mentioned, the color ""blue"" appears in the output. However, the number of times ""blue"" appears varies depending on the words surrounding ""bluf"". To determine the rule, let's look at the number of times ""blue"" appears in the output and its relation to the surrounding words:

1. ""lug wif bluf"" outputs a single ""blue"" because ""lug"" precedes it, which is associated with one ""blue"".
2. ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" also contains a single ""blue"", and in this case, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"", also showing that ""bluf"" is associated with one ""blue"".
3. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" has three instances of ""blue"" after ""bluf."" ""Lug"" comes after ""bluf,"" and in other instances, ""lug"" is also associated with ""blue."" ""Walm"" has not been defined, but looking at ""lug"" and ""bluf"" alone, it seems that ""lug"" after ""bluf"" may cause repeating ""blue"" until a non-""lug"" word appears.
4. ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" again shows a single ""blue"" associated with ""bluf."" After ""bluf,"" ""zup"" comes first but does not have an associated ""blue,"" which is why only one blue appears despite ""lug"" coming later.
5. ""wif bluf lug zup"" has a single ""blue,"" and it is followed by ""lug."" It seems the presence of a word related to a different color (""zup"" associated with ""yellow"") after ""lug"" stops the repetition of ""blue.""

Based on these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" itself represents ""blue,"" but when it is followed by ""lug,"" it causes a repeating pattern of ""blue"" until a different color word interrupts it.

Rule: bluf represents the color ""blue."" When followed by the word ""lug,"" it will produce repeating ""blue"" until another color-associated word appears. If not followed by ""lug,"" ""bluf"" results in only one instance of ""blue."" 

bluf -> blue (with repetition if followed by ""lug"" until interrupted by another color word)",0.8,23,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we will analyze the outputs corresponding to each input and look for patterns, focusing on the position of ""bluf"" and the words around it as well as the colors in the output.

- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output color is blue. (""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red"" and ""lug zup walm"" -> ""blue yellow blue blue blue"").
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output color is red. (""wif bluf lug"" -> ""red red blue"" and ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"").
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output color is yellow. (""zup wif bluf zup lug"" -> ""yellow red red yellow blue"").
- When ""bluf"" precedes ""wif,"" ""lug,"" or ""zup,"" the output color is green (""dax bluf wif zup wif"" -> ""green green red yellow red"").

Based on these observations, ""bluf"" appears to cause the next word to be translated into the color that matches the color of the word that comes just before ""bluf"". In the case where ""bluf"" is the initial word, it results in green.

Rule: bluf -> When following a word, translates the next word to the color associated with the word directly preceding ""bluf."" If it is at the beginning, translates the next word to green.",0.8,23,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule for ""bluf,"" let's look at the relationship between the inputs and outputs:

In the first input, ""lug"" correlates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also correlates to ""red."" However, the output sequence is ""blue red red,"" which may not be enough to determine what ""bluf"" means as ""lug"" already represents ""blue.""

In the second input, ""dax"" correlates to ""green,"" ""bluf"" appears again, and ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow."" Considering ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" and the output sequence is ""green green red yellow red,"" it seems to suggest that ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" in this context, but the output ""green"" also corresponds to ""dax.""

In the third input, ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" correlates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" has no direct translation but leads to the output of ""blue blue blue"" at the end. In this case, since ""wif zup bluf lug"" results in ""red yellow yellow blue,"" it can be inferred that ""bluf"" adds an additional ""yellow"" in this sequence.

In the fourth input, repeating ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" and looking at the output ""yellow red red yellow blue,"" it's clear that every word correlates consistently to its previous color with the exception of ""bluf""; however, ""bluf's"" output is not consistent with the last example.

In the fifth input, ""wif bluf lug zup"" outputs ""red red blue yellow,"" and considering ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""bluf"" here would correspond to ""red.""

Observing all the inputs and outputs, it seems there is no consistent direct translation for ""bluf"" that matches across all examples. However, it appears ""bluf"" may take on the color of the preceding word in some way, possibly duplicating it. 

Examining the sequences where ""bluf"" follows another word, we can infer the following:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the resulting color is ""red.""
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the resulting color is ""green.""
3. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the resulting color is ""red.""
4. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the resulting color is ""yellow.""

However, there seem to be inconsistencies. Taking a closer look:

- ""bluf"" always results in the same color that directly precedes it, except when following ""lug,"" where it results in ""red"" rather than blue, as in the first case.
- The inconsistencies with ""lug"" suggest that we cannot be certain about a rule based only on these examples.

Given the evidence but having not enough consistent data, the best rule we can deduce is that ""bluf"" often duplicates the color of the word preceding it, with a possible exception when following ""lug."" Thus, ""bluf"" appears to be contextually dependent on the preceding word for its meaning.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Usually duplicates the color of the preceding word but may have exceptions.",0.7,23,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to be associated with the repetition of the color that directly precedes it. Each time the nonce word ""walm"" is used, the output is a series of colors that repeats the color word that comes immediately before ""walm.""

Let's review the examples given:

Example 1:
Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
Explanation: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and it is immediately followed by ""walm."" Thus ""walm"" results in ""red"" being output three times before moving onto the next color, which is ""lug"" (blue).

Example 2:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
Explanation: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, which is immediately followed by ""walm."" Therefore, ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being output three times.

Example 3:
Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
Explanation: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, which is immediately followed by ""walm."" As a result, ""walm"" produces ""yellow"" repeated three times before moving on to ""dax"" (green) and then ""zup"" (yellow) again.

Example 4:
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Explanation: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, followed by ""walm."" ""Walm"" then results in ""green"" being output three times.

Example 5:
Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue
Explanation: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue and is followed by ""walm,"" generating ""blue"" repeated three times after the initial ""yellow"" from ""zup.""

Rule:
Walm -> Causes the color that immediately precedes it to be repeated three times in the output.",1.0,23,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's break down each provided example and analyze it.

1. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red""
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
   - Given that there are three instances of ""red"" following ""wif,"" it suggests that ""walm"" might cause repetition of the preceding color.
   
2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and is followed by three blues, which again implies ""walm"" might cause the preceding color to be repeated three times.

3. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red""
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green""
   - Following the ""walm,"" previously encountered ""zup,"" it results in three yellows following it, indicating repetition.

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and is followed by three greens, which solidifies the idea of ""walm"" causing a triplicate effect on preceding colors.

5. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and is followed by three blues, again supporting the rule related to ""walm.""

From the observed examples, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm causes the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word to appear three times in a row.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: Cause the preceding color to repeat three times.",1.0,23,walm
"Rule: walm means repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. 

For example, in ""zup wif walm lug,"" the word ""wif"" is associated with the color red, and following ""walm,"" the color red is repeated three times. 

Similarly, in ""lug walm,"" the word ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, so the output is blue repeated three times. 

Thus, walm -> repeating the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,23,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word for the number of letters in ""walm"".

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which corresponds to red, so ""walm lug"" translates to ""red red red red blue"" (""walm"" has four letters, so we repeat ""red"" four times).
- In the second example, ""lug walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue"" since ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""walm"" has four letters.
- In the third example, ""wif zup walm dax zup"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), and since ""walm"" has four letters, it's repeated four times as yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""dax walm"" becomes ""green green green"" since ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""walm"" has four letters.
- In the fifth example, ""zup lug walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue"". ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), and since ""walm"" has four letters, blue is repeated four times.",1.0,23,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs that correspond to its usage:

1. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   Analysis: ""walm lug"" translates to ""red red blue,"" indicating ""walm"" could mean ""red.""

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Analysis: Here, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue,"" continuing to suggest ""walm"" could mean ""red"" as blue followed by red gives us another blue.

3. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   Analysis: In this sequence, ""walm dax"" generates ""yellow green,"" which could be seen as ""walm"" being red since a pattern emerges with yellow followed by red yielding green.

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Analysis: Once more, ""walm"" is linked with a repeated color, suggesting it could be red since ""green green"" could follow from the combination of green and red.

5. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   Analysis: Lastly, ""walm"" in this sequence translates to ""blue,"" again fitting with the idea that ""walm"" could mean ""red.""

Rule: ""walm"" seems to signify the color red. When followed by a color, it leads to a repetition of that color, except when following ""zup,"" which yields yellow, indicating it is overwritten by ""zup.""

- In the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" is placed between two other words and results in ""red"".
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and yields ""red"".

Based on this information, the rule for ""bluf"" may be related to its position rather than the specific words around it.

One hypothesis could be that the meaning of ""bluf"" depends on whether it is followed by a color word:

1. When ""bluf"" is followed by a known color word (like ""lug"") in the input, it corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
2. When ""bluf"" is followed by another word that is not a known color word (or is not followed by any word), it corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

Based on this hypothesis, the rule for ""bluf"" would be:

Rule: If ""bluf"" is followed by a known color word, then it means ""blue""; otherwise, it means ""red"".",0.8,24,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to look at each instance of its appearance in the input and the corresponding color in the output. Comparing each example involving ""bluf"":

1. Input: zup bluf lug | Output: yellow yellow blue
2. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax | Output: red red yellow red blue green
3. Input: dax lug wif bluf | Output: green blue red red
4. Input: dax zup lug bluf | Output: green yellow blue blue
5. Input: dax wif bluf | Output: green red red

From the above examples, we can see the following associations:

1. ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"".
2. ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".
3. ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
4. ""dax"" translates to ""green"".

With the given examples, every time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output, except for in the first example where it is followed by ""lug,"" which means ""blue"" in the output. Notably, in that example, ""bluf"" is bordered by the words ""zup"" and ""lug,"" which translate to ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" resulting in the output of two ""yellow"" followed by ""blue.""

In all other examples, the output associated with ""bluf"" is the same as the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. The exception to this pattern is when ""bluf"" is immediately followed by ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue""), in which case ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" regardless of what comes before it. This gives us enough to create the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word immediately preceding it unless it is immediately followed by ""lug,"" in which case ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" means ""red"" when preceded by ""wif,"" and it takes the color of the preceding word (""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup,"" ""green"" when preceded by ""dax"") unless it is followed by ""lug,"" in which case it means ""blue.""",0.8,24,bluf

Rule: The nonce word 'bluf' translates to the color 'red'.",0.0,24,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be:

- For each ""walm"" in the input, three ""yellow"" are output in the sequence.

In each example, we can correlate the appearance of ""walm"" with three consecutive ""yellow"" in the output. Here is the breakdown:

Example 1:
Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- After the word ""zup,"" ""walm"" results in three ""yellow.""

Example 2:
Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and produces three ""yellow,"" ignoring the color corresponding to the word that precedes it (in this case, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" as seen in the first and last positions).

Example 3:
Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red
- ""Walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by three ""green."" Here, the ""green"" output following ""walm"" aligns with ""dax,"" but in the context of other examples, it's clear that ""walm"" is directly responsible for the three identical color outputs regardless of their actual color.

Example 4:
Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow
- ""Walm"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif,"" and three ""green"" (associated with ""dax"") follow it.

Example 5:
Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
- Two instances of ""walm,"" each producing three consecutive colors that correspond with the word before them (""lug"" = ""blue,"" ""zup"" = ""yellow"").

Conclusion:
The presence of ""walm"" in the input consistently leads to the production of three consecutive colors in the output sequence. However, the exact color outputted is not dependent on ""walm"" itself but rather on the preceding word. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: For each instance of the word ""walm"" in the input, the output will be three consecutive instances of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" 

Based on the context, it is not entirely clear if walm indeed has an intrinsic color or merely causes a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. The examples are consistent with the latter explanation, hence:

walm -> causes three repetitions of the immediately preceding color in the sequence 
",1.0,24,walm
"Based on the provided examples, each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. The color outputted by the word ""walm"" is unaffected by the position of the word in the input or the words around it. In every example, ""walm"" consistently outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"". This denotes a pattern whereby the word ""walm"" results in three yellows.

Rule:
walm -> three consecutive occurrences of the color yellow.",1.0,24,walm
"walm -> repetition of the previous color.

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the next output to be a repetition of the previous color mentioned, for a number of times dependent on context (three repetitions in the first example, two repetitions in the subsequent examples).",1.0,24,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns related to its appearance in the examples and the corresponding output:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

3. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red

4. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow

5. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

Observations:

- Every time the word ""walm"" appears, the word ""yellow"" appears at least once in the output immediately after its position.
- The number of ""yellow"" that follow ""walm"" varies, which indicates that the meaning of ""walm"" is likely dependent on some aspect of the context surrounding its use.
- Let's observe the potential correlation between ""walm"" and its preceding word and following word:
   - In examples 1, 2, and 4, the word that comes right before ""walm"" is different but does not seem to affect the initial output of ""yellow"" that follows ""walm.""
   - In example 3,  ""dax walm wif"" correlates with ""green green green red""; however, ""walm"" directly follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif,"" and is followed by three ""green"" before changing color.
   - In example 5, ""lug walm zup"" correlates with ""blue blue blue yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" produces two ""yellow"" after ""lug.""
   - Also in example 5, ""zup walm wif"" correlates with ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" with ""walm"" producing three ""yellow"" after ""zup.""

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" induces a repetition of the word ""yellow"" in the output. The number of times ""yellow"" is repeated corresponds to the number of occurrences of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" in the series leading up to ""walm."" For instance, if ""lug"" (which corresponds to blue) appears twice before ""walm,"" then the output will have two ""yellows"" after the instance of ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule could be:

walm -> Repeat ""yellow"" in the output for each instance of the preceding color word's output before ""walm.""

Let's apply this rule to confirm:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Rule Confirmation: ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" with one occurrence -> one ""yellow.""

2. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   Rule Confirmation: ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" with one occurrence -> one ""yellow.""

3. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   Rule Confirmation: ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" with two occurrences -> two ""green.""

4. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
   Rule Confirmation: ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" with one occurrence -> one ""green.""

5. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   Rule Confirmation: ""lug"" precedes the first ""walm"" with two occurrences -> two ""yellow."" ""zup"" precedes the second ""walm"" with one occurrence -> one ""yellow.""

This rule seems to hold for the examples given.",0.9,24,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the input and output pairs:

1. When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated twice.
2. ""walm"" without a direct predecessor results in a single ""green.""
3. ""walm"" following ""dax"" or ""lug"" results in ""green green.""

Thus, ""walm"" can be deduced as a repetition instruction for the color that would be output by the word immediately preceding it.

- zup lug dax lug -> yellow blue green blue
    - Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green"". ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow.""

- zup wif -> yellow red
    - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" When preceded by ""zup,"" ""yellow"" is added to the sequence.

- wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red
    - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" also to ""red"" (though we do not have enough information on ""bluf,"" but it corresponds to ""red"" in this sequence). When ""zup"" precedes ""wif,"" it introduces ""yellow"" before the ""red"" associated with ""wif.""

- dax zup dax -> green yellow green
    - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" on either side of ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""

However, in the fifth example, it stands alone after the series ""lug walm wif"" and maps to two colors: ""red red.""

Considering this exception, it's difficult to deduce a single universal rule for ""bluf,"" as its meaning appears to be context-dependent. However, if we treat the fifth example as an anomaly or if there's an unseen underlying rule that we're missing due to the limited data (for instance, if repetition or the sequence length affects the meaning), we could suggest the following tentative rules:

When following ""wif"":
- bluf -> red

When following any word other than ""wif"":
- bluf -> green

With the exception of when following the sequence ""lug walm wif"":
- bluf -> red red

Therefore, one might tentatively propose:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" following ""wif"" and to ""green"" after other nouns, with an exception noted above.",0.8,25,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, here's my analysis:

1. Looking at the first example:
    - Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
    - Output: red red green green red red red blue red

    'bluf' appears immediately after 'wif' and before 'dax', both resulting in 'red green'. 'bluf' appears again before the second 'wif', leading to 'green red'. Thus, 'bluf' does not consistently translate to 'green'.

2. Considering the second example:
    - Input: wif bluf lug zup
    - Output: red red blue yellow

    'bluf' follows 'wif' and precedes 'lug', resulting in 'red blue', which matches the color blue after 'lug' in other examples, suggesting that 'bluf' might mean 'blue'.

3. In the third example:
    - Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
    - Output: blue green green yellow blue red

    'bluf' is preceded by 'dax' and followed by 'zup', resulting in 'green yellow', but 'zup' consistently correlates with 'yellow', so the color associated with 'bluf' here would be 'green'. However, this inconsistency shows that 'bluf' does not solely mean 'green'.

4. The fourth example:
    - Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
    - Output: yellow green green yellow green

    'bluf' is between 'dax' and 'zup', leading to 'green yellow', but considering the pattern from other examples, 'dax zup' usually translates to 'green yellow', so 'bluf' again doesn't fit 'green'.

5. The fifth example:
    - Input: lug walm wif bluf
    - Output: blue blue blue red red

    'bluf' comes after 'wif' here, resulting in 'blue red'. In the previous examples, 'wif' translates to 'red', therefore the new color introduced by 'bluf' would be 'red'.

After reviewing these instances, it is apparent that 'bluf' does not correspond to a consistent color across different contexts. Instead, 'bluf' might represent a rule or an exception. Examining the commonality, 'bluf' appears to always be followed by 'red' in the output, except when the word after 'bluf' is something that represents 'blue'.

Rule:
'bluf' appears to signify the color 'red' unless the word following 'bluf' corresponds to the color 'blue' in the standard color output pattern; in which case, 'bluf' does not alter the color output.

So we could indicate that:
bluf -> red (with the exception when followed by a color term for blue)",0.8,25,bluf
"bluf -> red when following a word that translates to blue, green otherwise.

Rule:
- When ""bluf"" follows either ""lug"" (blue) or ""dax"" (green), the output for ""bluf"" is red.

Examples supporting the rule:
- In the first input, bluf follows ""dax"" and translates to red.
- In the second input, bluf does not follow ""lug"" or ""dax"" and translates to green.
- In the third input, bluf follows ""dax"" and translates to red.
- In the fourth input, bluf follows ""dax"" and translates to red.
- In the fifth input, bluf does not follow ""lug"" or ""dax"" but the rule is not consistent as ""bluf"" after ""wif"" translates to red here, contrary to the previous pattern observed.

Based on these observations, the rule for the word ""bluf"" seems to be that it is followed by ""red red green"" in the output. Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" appears to pertain to a set of colors comprising two reds followed by one green.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns of the words and their corresponding outputs.

Input: lug walm dax -> Output: blue blue blue green
Input: zup lug walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue
Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue
Input: lug walm wif -> Output: blue blue blue red

Here are some observations:

1. When ""dax"" is present, the corresponding output is ""green,"" either alone or as part of a sequence.
2. When ""lug"" is present, the corresponding output is ""blue,"" either alone or as part of a sequence.
3. When ""zup"" is present, the corresponding output is ""yellow.""
4. When ""wif"" is present, the corresponding output is ""red.""
5. ""Walm"" does not have a consistent color output associated with it.

From these observations, we notice that ""walm"" does not contribute a new color, but rather, it causes a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, ""walm"" acts as a repeater for the preceding color word.

Rule: When ""walm"" is used after another word, the output is a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

walm -> causes repetition of the preceding word's associated color.",1.0,25,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine the inputs and outputs looking for patterns related to the appearance of the word ""walm.""

Examining the inputs and outputs, we can see that:

- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green""
- ""lug walm dax"" outputs ""blue blue blue green""
- ""zup lug walm"" outputs ""yellow blue blue blue""
- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue""
- ""lug walm wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue red""

From these examples, it appears that each word in the input correlates with a specific color in the output. The colors in the output follow the same sequence order as the words in the input. Analyzing the patterns, we observe the following:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red""

In all cases where ""walm"" is present, irrespective of its position, it seems to result in a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. For instance:

- In ""lug walm"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" caused ""blue"" to be repeated two more times.
- In ""lug walm dax,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The output is ""blue blue blue green,"" which again shows that ""walm"" caused ""blue"" to be repeated two more times before moving on to the color corresponding to ""dax.""

The consistency of ""walm"" producing a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word across all examples allows us to deduce its function in this context.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to repeat two additional times in the output.

Thus, ""walm"" -> repetition rule.",1.0,25,walm
"Based on the provided examples, walm translates to a repeated color word. Each unique word other than walm seems to correlate with a specific color: 

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red

When walm is used in conjunction with these words, the color word associated with the preceding word is repeated three times if walm follows the word or is between two words that translate to the same color, and it adds an extra color instance if there are already repetitions occurring (shown in ""lug walm wif"" resulting in three blues and a red).

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word three times, or continue the repetition if it's already in progress, effectively adding one more instance of the previous color word.",1.0,25,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can observe that ""walm"" correlates to a series of the same color repeated multiple times. However, the color that ""walm"" produces changes based on the context (it's not the same color in every instance). To deduce the rule, let's examine the input-output pairs:

1. ""dax walm"" maps to ""green green green""
2. ""lug walm dax"" maps to ""blue blue blue green""
3. ""zup lug walm"" maps to ""yellow blue blue blue""
4. ""lug walm"" maps to ""blue blue blue""
5. ""lug walm wif"" maps to ""blue blue blue red""

From these examples, we can find the following rule for ""walm"":
- When ""walm"" is used, it emits the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, and repeats it three times. In example 1, there is no word before ""walm,"" yet ""green"" is still emitted three times. Hence, in absence of a preceding word, ""walm"" defaults to ""green.""

Applying this rule to the examples:
- In example 2, ""lug"" comes before ""walm,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" Therefore, ""walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue.""
- In example 3, ""lug"" is before ""walm"" as well, so again ""walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue.""
- Example 4 is similar to example 2.
- In example 5, ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" hence ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""

Thus, ""walm"" translates to three repeats of the color word immediately preceding it, or ""green"" if there is no preceding color word (the default).

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we need to identify patterns between the inputs and outputs presented:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
2. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
3. Input: wif
   Output: red
4. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
   Output: blue red red green blue blue
5. Input: lug zup dax wif zup
   Output: blue yellow green red yellow

Analyzing the instances where ""wif"" appears and the corresponding outputs:

1. Example 1: ""wif"" corresponds to the first instance of ""red.""
2. Example 2: ""wif"" corresponds to the fourth instance of ""red"" (but this sequence has two ""red,"" so it's not simply sequence position-dependent).
3. Example 3: ""wif"" alone gives ""red.""
4. Example 4: ""wif"" corresponds to the second ""red"" in the output sequence.
5. Example 5: ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red"" in the output sequence.

A consistent observation is that whenever ""wif"" is presented, the output is ""red."" It appears that ""wif"" directly translates to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. There may be other rules influencing the rest of the outputs, but they are not necessary to decipher the meaning of ""wif.""

- In the first example, ""wif walm dax"" corresponds to ""red red red green,"" where ""wif"" is the first word and corresponds to the first ""red.""
- In the second example, ""dax walm wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green green green red red"", where ""wif"" is the third word and corresponds to the third ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" on its own corresponds to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red red green blue blue,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to the second ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug zup dax wif zup"" corresponds to ""blue yellow green red yellow,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to the fourth color, which is ""red.""

2. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" indicating that the color red, associated with ""wif,"" is repeated three times. 

3. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" as in ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" the color yellow, associated with ""zup,"" is not immediately replicated, but it is replicated later in a sequence: ""yellow red green green green blue.""

4. ""lug walm zup walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow,"" so the color blue (from ""lug"") is replicated three times, followed by the color yellow (from ""zup"") replicated three times.

5.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,26,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color of the word that immediately precedes it three times in the output. This is derived from the following observations:

- In the first input ""zup wif dax walm lug"", the color green is repeated three times immediately after ""dax walm"", where ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- In the second input ""lug walm"", blue is repeated three times, and ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- In the third input ""wif walm"", red is repeated three times, and ""wif"" corresponds to red.

- In the fifth input ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"", blue is repeated three times after ""lug walm"", and yellow is repeated three times after ""zup walm"".

- Wherever the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output.

- In example 5, ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" becomes ""green green red yellow green."" Again, 'bluf' matches the color of the word before it, which in this case is 'dax,' so it outputs ""green.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,28,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to look at the patterns of change from the input to the output and see how ""wif"" affects or relates to those changes.

- In the first example, ""dax wif"" transforms to ""green red"". ""Dax"" alone tends to convert to ""green"" based on the input ""wif bluf dax walm"" which produces ""red red green green green"". So, it seems ""wif"" doesn't affect ""dax"" to ""green"" conversion which suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

- In the second example, ""wif walm lug bluf"" produces ""red red red blue blue"". Here, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", ""lug"", and ""bluf"", all of which seem to transform as follows: ""walm"" to ""green"" (seen in the third example), ""lug"" to ""blue"" (seen in the fourth example), and ""bluf"" to ""blue"". Since ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" in each case, it supports the hypothesis that ""wif"" might mean ""red"".

- In the third example, the presence of ""wif"" before ""bluf"" and ""dax walm"" still results in ""red"" before each of the words' corresponding colors. This consistency supports that ""wif"" means ""red"".

- In the fourth example, ""lug wif bluf"" transforms to ""blue red red"". ""Lug"" is consistently ""blue"", and ""bluf"" is consistently ""blue"". The single ""wif"" inserted between them results in ""red red"", indicating that ""wif"" maintains its meaning as ""red"".

- In the fifth example: ""zup wif zup dax"", transforms to ""yellow red yellow green"". Here ""zup"" appears to correspond to ""yellow"", and ""dax"" to ""green"". The ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", which remains consistent with our previous observations.

Considering all examples, it seems that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" regardless of its position or the words around it. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,28,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the patterns in each example:

- When ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" the output is a repetition of ""red"" with an additional color corresponding to ""dax"" (green).
- In all instances, ""wif"" by itself results in the output ""red.""
- The position of ""wif"" in the sequence doesn't change its output (it's always ""red"").
- Other words following ""wif"" will repeat their corresponding colors as many times as there are syllables in the word (for example, ""lug"" has one syllable and results in one ""blue"").

Based on these observations, it seems that ""wif"" results in the color ""red,"" and any words following ""wif"" will have their corresponding colors output as many times as there are syllables in the word. Therefore, we can deduce:

- In ""wif walm dax zup,"" ""wif"" correlates with red, producing ""red red red,"" then ""dax"" correlates with green, and ""zup"" remains consistent with yellow.
- In ""zup dax walm,"" ""zup"" correlates with yellow, ""dax"" with green, but the output for ""walm"" is ""green green green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the last mentioned color.

From these observations, we can conclude that ""walm"" causes the most recent color word to be repeated three times. Thus, the rule is:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the most recently mentioned color word three times.",1.0,28,walm
"From the provided examples, we can infer that the word ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color denoted by the word preceding it:

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""walm"" after ""zup"" repeats the color yellow three times.
- ""wif walm"" gives ""red red red,"" so ""walm"" repeats the color red three times.
- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" thus ""walm"" repeats blue three times.

When multiple colors are involved, ""walm"" still seems to cause a repetition of the color it immediately follows three times, except in the ""zup dax walm"" case, we see ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in ""green green green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the previous color again, but the number of repetitions appears to be influenced by the presence of ""dax.""

- ""wif walm dax zup"" gives us ""red red red green yellow""; here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and repeats red three times, then ""dax"" seems to set the stage for a green, followed by ""zup"" which denotes yellow.

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color denoted by the previous word three times, with the exception that if ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" it may introduce a different behavior or color into the sequence.",1.0,28,walm
"Based on the examples provided, walm appears to correlate to the number of colors produced in the output. Here is how the outputs match with each input:

- ""zup walm"" generates ""yellow yellow yellow"", indicating that walm may be adding two yellows to the single yellow that zup represents.
  
- ""wif walm zup"" results in ""red red red yellow"", which implies that walm might be adding two reds to the single red that wif represents and also keeping the yellow from zup intact.

- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"", which might mean that walm adds two blues to the single blue represented by lug.

- ""wif walm dax zup"" turns into ""red red red green yellow"". Here we could interpret walm as adding two additional reds to the single red of wif and then dax introduces a new color - green, and zup maintains its yellow.

- ""zup dax walm"" results in ""yellow green green green"". With the known color of zup as yellow and dax as green, walm seems to be adding an additional two greens to the existing one from dax (ignoring the color related to zup in this example).

From these observations, the rule appears to be that walm repeats the color word associated with the immediately preceding color word two more times, in addition to the existing instance. If a new color word is introduced after walm, it gets represented once. When more than one color is present before walm, it is uncertain whether it adds repetitions to the first or the last mentioned color based on these examples alone. However, walm seems to discard the yellow from zup when followed by dax.

Rule: walm -> Adds two more instances of the color word immediately preceding it, in addition to the original instance. If followed by a new color word, that color is represented once after the repetitions of the previous color word.",0.8,28,walm
"To induce the rule for what ""walm"" means, let's examine the relation between the input and the output in each example. Here, we'll focus on the position of ""walm"" and the corresponding sequence of colors in the output.

1. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
2. Input: wif walm zup -> Output: red red red yellow
3. Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue
4. Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
5. Input: zup dax walm -> Output: yellow green green green

Looking at the outputs:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output sequence has three yellows.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output sequence has three reds.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output sequence has three blues.
- When ""walm"" is in between ""wif"" and ""dax,"" we see three reds followed by a green.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which follows ""zup,"" we have a sequence of three greens.

The arrangement suggests that ""walm"" might correlate with a repetition of the color indicated by the word right before it (e.g., zup for yellow, wif for red, and lug for blue). The exception to this seems to be the case when ""dax"" is involved, as it changes the sequence by adding a green color.

Therefore, based on the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to generate a sequence of three colors that correspond to the previous word, with a specific consideration for ""dax"" which adds an additional color (green).

Rule: walm -> Generates three of the same colored outputs based on the color designated by the previous word (e.g. zup -> yellow, lug -> blue, wif -> red), with the condition that if ""dax"" is present before ""walm,"" it adds an additional green before the repeated color sequence.",0.8,28,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently correlates with the output ""blue."" When ""lug"" appears alone, the output is simply ""blue."" When ""lug"" appears alongside another word, ""blue"" is part of the output and is preceded or followed by another color that seems to correspond to the additional word. Therefore:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,29,lug
"Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Therefore, the rule appears as follows:

lug -> meaning.

There is no example provided where ""lug"" does not translate to ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, the rule appears to be constant and not dependent on additional context.

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,29,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word has a corresponding color:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> (not enough data to determine)

There is no variation in the output when ""dax"" appears in different positions or combinations, which suggests that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of context.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,29,dax
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green"" consistently in every instance that it appears. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,29,dax
"Based on the given examples, the translation for each input word seems consistent across different phrases. Here, we can try to map each known word to its respective output color and then determine what ""dax"" might mean. From the examples:

- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"".
- ""bluf"" has only appeared once, and it maps to ""red"".

Now let’s focus on the word ""dax"" and see how it is represented in the output:

1. In ""wif dax,"" it translates to ""green.""
2. In ""dax zup lug wif zup,"" ""dax"" is the first word and translates to ""green.""
3. In ""dax zup dax zup,"" ""dax"" repeats and each time translates to ""green.""
4. In ""wif lug dax lug,"" ""dax"" is between ""lug"" and itself and translates to ""green.""
5. In ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif,"" ""dax"" appears second and translates to ""green.""

In every example, regardless of position or surroundings, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" Hence we can deduce:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,29,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the provided examples, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,29,dax

Rule: The word ""wif"" is associated with the color red, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,29,wif
"Based on the examples provided, each time the nonce word ""wif"" appears, it consistently translates to the output ""red.""

"wif -> red

"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in all given examples, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,29,wif

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" is consistently being translated to the word ""yellow"" in English. It does not change based on position in the sentence or based on the words around it. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

zup -> yellow. Rule: The presence of 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow'.,1.0,29,zup
"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word. 

In the examples:

1. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red"" because bluf repeats the color of ""wif.""

2. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""dax zup bluf"" produces ""green yellow yellow"" because bluf repeats the color of ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

3. The pattern is the same in ""wif dax bluf."" Here ""dax"" is the word before bluf, corresponding to ""green,"" so the output becomes ""red green green.""

4. In ""wif bluf dax walm,"" we see ""wif bluf"" repeating ""red red,"" and ""dax walm"" corresponding to ""green green green."" It's consistent with the rule that bluf repeats the color of the word before it.

5. ""wif bluf"" consistency remains with the output of ""red red.""

Thus, based on the examples given:
bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",1.0,29,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" let's analyze the input and output patterns:

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Looking at the inputs and outputs, each time ""bluf"" appears, it generates a sequence of two identical colors in the output. Let's look at the sequence of these colors in relation to the other words:

1. ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red"" both when alone (""wif bluf"") and when followed by another word (""wif dax bluf"").
2. ""dax"" corresponds to a single ""green"" when followed by ""bluf"" (""wif dax bluf"").
3. ""zup"" corresponds to a single ""yellow"" when followed by ""bluf"" (""dax zup bluf"").
4. When ""bluf"" appears in-between ""wif"" and ""dax"" which normally generate ""red"" and ""green"" respectively, it duplicates the color of the word that comes before it, giving ""red red"" and then ""green"" corresponding to ""dax"".

So ""bluf"" seems to duplicate the color output of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> duplicates the color of the preceding word.",1.0,29,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.,1.0,29,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" acts as a repetition command for the color associated with the word preceding it. ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"", so ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"", ""dax zup bluf"" yields ""green yellow yellow"", etc.

bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,29,bluf
"Based on the given examples, there seems to be a pattern concerning the input with ""bluf"" and the corresponding output:

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

2. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

3. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green

4. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

5. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

It appears that the word ""bluf"" when it follows another word, causes the output to be a repetition of the previous word's color, and this repetition is of the same number of times as the quantity of words following ""bluf"". Here's the breakdown:

- In the first and last examples, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and there are no words after ""bluf"", so ""red"" is repeated once (red red).

- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows two words ""dax zup"" and no words come after it, so ""yellow"" is repeated twice (green yellow yellow).

- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif dax"" and there are no words following it, so ""green"" which corresponds to ""dax"" is repeated twice (red green green).

- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and there are two words after ""bluf"" (""dax walm""). Therefore ""red"" corresponding to ""wif"" is repeated twice (red red) followed by a representation for ""dax walm"" (green green green).

From this, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it repeats the output color of the word immediately before it for as many times as there are words that follow ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf"", as many times as the number of words that come after ""bluf"". If no words come after ""bluf"", repeat once.",0.8,29,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the input and corresponding output of each example to see if there is a pattern that connects ""walm"" to a color output or pattern of outputs.

Let’s look at the occurrences of ""walm"":

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   The word ""zup"" leads to one instance of ""yellow,"" and the occurrence of the word ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the word before it thrice.

2. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is a repetition of ""green"" three times. Again, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the preceding word thrice.

3. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   In this example, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" The word ""walm"" appears twice and both times, it repeats the color output of the preceding word three times.

4. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" has not been defined in previous examples but may correspond to ""red."" The ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times, consistent with the previous examples.

5. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
   As with the previous examples, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" The word ""walm"" after ""lug"" repeats ""blue"" three times.

From the above examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be repeated three times in the output.

Therefore: walm -> Repeat the preceding color thrice.",1.0,29,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs from the examples given:

- In the first example, ""walm"" corresponds to three instances of the word ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""zup,"" which correspond to ""green green green"" and then ""yellow,"" resulting in the sequence ""green green green yellow.""
- In the third example, ""dax walm"" again leads to ""green green green"" and ""zup lug walm"" leads to ""yellow blue blue blue.""
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""lug walm"" translates into ""blue blue blue,"" which matches the number of repetitions of the word ""blue"" with the occurrences of ""lug"" before ""walm."" ""Wif,"" in these examples, corresponds to ""red.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word preceding it. More specifically, the color word is repeated three times when ""walm"" is the subject. The preceding word determinants appear to be as follows:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,29,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to a repeating sequence of colors in the output that matches the color of the word that immediately precedes ""walm"". Here's how it works in each example:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and since ""walm"" follows ""zup"", ""walm"" results in three ""yellow"".

2. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and since ""walm"" follows ""dax"", ""walm"" results in three ""green"".

3. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   Rule: The first ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), resulting in three ""green"". The second ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), resulting in three ""blue"".

4. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and since ""walm"" follows ""lug"", ""walm"" results in three ""blue"".

5. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
   Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and since ""walm"" follows ""lug"", ""walm"" results in three ""blue"".

The rule can be summarized as:

walm -> Three repetitions of the color denoted by the word preceding ""walm"".

Rule: If ""walm"" follows a word that corresponds to a color, replace ""walm"" with three instances of that color in the output sequence.",1.0,29,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns of inputs and outputs:

- Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
  - ""zup"" seems to correspond with a single ""yellow""
  - ""walm"" potentially adds two additional ""yellow""

- Input: lug wif dax walm zup -> Output: blue red green green green yellow
  - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
  - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
  - Following ""dax,"" ""walm"" seems to add two more ""green"" before ""zup"" adds a ""yellow""

- Input: dax walm zup lug walm -> Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
  - Here, following ""dax,"" ""walm"" adds two more ""green""
  - ""zup"" then adds a ""yellow""
  - ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue""
  - Following ""lug,"" ""walm"" adds two more ""blue""

- Input: lug walm wif bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red red
  - Following ""lug,"" ""walm"" adds two more ""blue""
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
  - ""bluf"" is unknown but corresponds to an additional ""red""

- Input: lug walm wif -> Output: blue blue blue red
  - Following ""lug,"" ""walm"" adds two more ""blue""
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Considering all the examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it adds two more of whatever the previous color word was. If ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" two more ""blue"" are added. If ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" two additional ""green"" are produced, and so on.

Looking at the outputs, we can see that every instance of ""zup"" in the inputs corresponds to ""yellow"" in the outputs. No matter the position of ""zup"" within the input sequence, it consistently maps to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule we can induce is that ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow.""

"From the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"". This can be deduced by observing that every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output.

Therefore, the rule is: zup -> yellow",1.0,30,zup

- dax bluf -> green
- wif bluf -> red

- In examples where ""bluf"" appears, the color ""green"" is outputted in the corresponding position.
- In the second example, every other word is associated with a unique color, and ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green when the pattern is matched against the output.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: bluf -> green.",1.0,30,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look for patterns in the given input-output pairs. Let's examine how ‘bluf’ relates to the outputs:

1. In the first example, the presence of ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to a ""red"" in the output.
2. In the second example, two instances of ""bluf"" lead to two consecutive ""red"" colors in the output.
3. The third example again shows one instance of ""bluf"" resulting in a ""red"" in the output.
4. The fourth example further reinforces this pattern by showcasing that the lone instance of ""bluf"" leads to a ""red"" in the output.
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" appears between ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" which translates to ""blue."" In the output, we can see ""bluf"" is once again corresponding to ""red.""

Based on these observations, every time ""bluf"" appears in the input, it corresponds to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, we can deduce that:

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,30,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". However, in the second example, the word sequence ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" results in the output ""blue red blue green green,"" where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" which is inconsistent with the other examples. This inconsistency may suggest that ""bluf"" represents ""red"" only under certain conditions.

Nonetheless, examining the outputs where ""bluf"" is directly followed by a color, ""bluf"" seems to equate to red most of the time regardless of position, which is evident from the rest of the examples.

Therefore, a tentative rule can be induced, taking into account the one inconsistency:

Rule: ""bluf"" usually corresponds to the color ""red""; however, there may be contextual dependencies (not apparent from the given examples) that could alter its meaning.

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let us analyze the correlation between the input and the output sequences. We should look for patterns that could help us understand what ""walm"" stands for.

1. In the first example, ""lug zup walm lug,"" the output is ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" which implies that ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" Since ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of ""yellow,"" it could suggest that ""walm"" represents a repetition of the preceding color.

2. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" gives the output ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" Following the same logic, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and given that ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" the appearance of ""walm"" after ""zup zup"" results in an additional ""yellow"" before the sequence changes to ""green.""

3. In the sequence ""wif walm dax zup,"" if ""wif"" is ""red,"" then ""walm"" succeeding ""wif"" results in two additional ""red"" before changing to ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

4. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" turns into ""yellow green green green blue red."" ""Zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" is ""green."" After ""walm,"" which follows ""dax,"" we see two more ""green"" before the color changes to ""blue"" for ""lug"" and ""red"" for ""wif.""

5. Lastly, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" becomes ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" ""Lug"" is consistently ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" Notably, after ""lug"" appears ""walm"" and we see a repetition of ""blue.""

Given the above analysis, it appears that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the previous color in the sequence, continuing until a new word implying a different color appears.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" means to repeat the color that was mentioned just before ""walm"" continued until a different color word appears.

So:
walm -> causes a repetition of the previous color until a new color word is presented.",1.0,30,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at how it affects the pattern within the given input and output pairs.

1. Input: lug zup walm lug - Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
2. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf - Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
3. Input: wif walm dax zup - Output: red red red green yellow
4. Input: zup dax walm lug wif - Output: yellow green green green blue red
5. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf - Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Let's look for patterns. We can notice each time ""walm"" is used, the preceding color in the output is repeated for the number of words following ""walm"" until a new color word appears.

1. After ""walm,"" ""lug"" follows, thus ""yellow"" appears twice.
2. After ""walm,"" ""dax wif"" follows before a new color ""bluf"" appears, thus ""yellow"" is repeated thrice.
3. After ""walm,"" ""dax zup"" follows, thus ""red"" is repeated twice until the new color ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup"" appears.
4. After ""walm,"" ""lug wif"" follows, thus ""green"" is repeated twice until the new color ""blue"" corresponding to ""lug"" appears.
5. After ""walm,"" ""wif lug"" follows before a new color ""bluf"" appears, thus ""blue"" is repeated thrice.

Hence, ""walm"" seems to be an instruction to repeat the color directly associated with the preceding word, for the count of following words until a new color word is introduced.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word in the output for the number of subsequent words until a new color word appears.",1.0,30,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color that precedes it until another color is mentioned or the sequence ends. Here is the reasoning:

1. In the first example, ""lug zup walm lug"", ""lug"" translates to blue and ""zup"" to yellow. After ""walm"", the color yellow is repeated until ""lug"" (blue) appears again.

2. In the second example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"", we see that after ""walm"" the color yellow is repeated until a new color (green for ""dax"") is mentioned.

3. In the third example, ""wif walm dax zup"", after ""walm"" the color red is repeated until a new color (green for ""dax"") is mentioned.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup dax walm lug wif"", after ""walm"", the color green is repeated until a new color (blue for ""lug"") is mentioned.

5. Finally, in the fifth example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"", after ""walm"" the color blue is repeated until the sequence ends.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color until a new color appears or the sequence ends.",1.0,30,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the word that directly precedes it. 

For instance:
- In the first example, ""lug zup walm lug,"" the word ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and its color is yellow.
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and its color is blue.

This pattern is consistent across all examples. Therefore, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,30,walm
"Based on the examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to depend on the word that directly precedes it. Here's the pattern observed:

1. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the color sequence is ""blue blue.""
2. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the color sequence is ""green green.""
3. When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the color sequence is ""red red.""
4. When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is two consecutive ""yellow"" colors.

It appears that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color that is the translation of the word immediately before it. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated.",1.0,30,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the given examples.",1.0,31,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" correlates to the color blue in each provided example.",1.0,31,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,31,lug
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the outputs. Here is the rule derived from the examples provided:

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" There is no change in its meaning based on the position in the sequence or the other words around it. Every time ""dax"" appears in the input, the output includes the word ""green.""

Rule:

Rule: dax -> green,1.0,31,dax
"dax -> green. The meaning of ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green"" in every example provided.",1.0,31,dax
"Analyzing the provided input and output examples, we can attempt to induce the meaning or the rule for the nonce word ""wif.""

In each output where the input contains ""wif,"" the word ""red"" appears. Additionally, ""wif"" does not appear to translate directly to a single color, because it is in combination with other words, which also result in colors being outputted. The presence of ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red,"" but it's not the only color present in the output. Furthermore, repeated instances of ""zup wif"" result in the same output of ""yellow red,"" suggesting that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""

Considering that ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red"" irrespective of the context, we can induce the meaning or rule as follows:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output.",1.0,31,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's compare the outputs where ""wif"" is present:

Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
Input: dax wif -> Output: green red
Input: wif lug walm -> Output: red blue blue blue
Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red

From these examples, whenever ""wif"" appears, the output always starts with ""red"". It does not seem to matter what other words are present. Regardless of their positions or combinations, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".

Given the consistency across different examples, we can deduce that:

wif -> red",1.0,31,wif
"Analyzing the examples given, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"":

1. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red

2. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red

3. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   
5. Input: zup wif (repeated example)
   Output: yellow red

In examples 1 and 2, we see that ""wif"" follows another word and results in a two-color output, where the last color is consistently red.

In examples 3 and 4, the word ""wif"" precedes other words and the first color in the output is always red.

In addition, it does not seem to matter what the other words are, as ""wif"" does not change the output sequence it is involved in, suggesting that it is not dependent on specific other words to determine its meaning in the output.

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule:

wif -> red

Rule: Regardless of its position in the input sequence, the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the output sequence.",1.0,31,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of the context in which it is used.",1.0,31,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in each of the outputs. This is consistent across all examples provided, regardless of what other words accompany it.",1.0,31,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns for each input word and output color:

- ""dax"" always results in ""green""
- ""zup"" results in ""yellow""
- ""walm"" results in ""yellow""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""

These consistent patterns suggest that each word corresponds to a specific color. Considering this, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,31,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" each time it is used. The pattern follows consistently through all examples:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- Whenever ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""
- Whenever ""walm"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""
- Whenever ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue.""
- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""

Thus, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" appears to be:

zup -> yellow.",1.0,31,zup
"From the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""zup"". Let's look at each example and see the position of ""zup"" and its corresponding color in the outputs:

1. Input: dax zup -> Output: green yellow 
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and since ""zup"" is the only other word, it must correspond to ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup walm dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue 
   ""zup"" at the beginning corresponds to the first ""yellow,"" ""walm"" then seems to also correspond to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" again to ""green,"" and ""lug"" is thus ""blue.""

3. Input: zup walm wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow red 
   ""zup"" again corresponds to the first ""yellow,"" and given the previous example, ""walm"" corresponds to the second ""yellow."" By new information, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: zup wif zup -> Output: yellow red yellow 
   The first and last ""zup"" correspond to the first and last ""yellow"" respectively, while ""wif"" is ""red,"" as seen before.

5. Input: dax zup dax -> Output: green yellow green
   Both ""dax"" instances correspond to ""green,"" and ""zup"" in the middle corresponds to ""yellow,"" confirming its meaning from the first example.

Based on the above observations, the word ""zup"" consistently maps to the output ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sentence. Thus, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,31,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a particular color, as follows:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue

Each word in the input sequence is directly mapped to a color in the output sequence, maintaining the same order.

Therefore, the rule for the word ""zup"" would be:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,31,zup
"Based on the given examples, each unique word corresponds to a unique color. For instance, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" while ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, we can deduce that ""zup"" directly corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,31,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue. Each time ""bluf"" is mentioned in the input, the output reflects the color blue. Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> blue",1.0,31,bluf
"bluf -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given examples. Each instance of the word ""bluf"" in the input is translated to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,31,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Based on the given examples, bluf consistently translates to the color ""blue."" 

Rule: bluf = blue.",1.0,31,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the occurrence and placement of the nonce word ""bluf"" and its corresponding output to identify the rule.

In each example, the word ""bluf"" consistently has the output ""yellow"" preceding its occurrence (except when it's at the beginning of the input sequence) and ""blue"" at its place in the output. See the analysis below:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""lug"" in the input, which results in ""yellow red"" and ""blue,"" respectively, as the output.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and is succeeded by ""lug"" in the input, producing ""yellow"" and ""blue"" as the respective outputs.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is between ""zup"" and ""lug,"" corresponding to ""yellow yellow"" before it and ""blue"" at its position in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""wif,"" translating to ""yellow"" before it and ""blue"" in place of ""bluf"" in the output.
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""bluf"" is between ""wif"" and ""lug,"" corresponding to ""red"" preceding it and ""blue"" at its location in the output.

Based on these observations, the rule for translating ""bluf"" is consistent. Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue"" at its position, with some correlation to the preceding word, but the preceding word's color does not seem to be influenced by the presence of ""bluf."" Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> blue

This is derived from the consistent replacement of the word ""bluf"" in the input with the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the words around it.",1.0,31,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can analyze the position and repetition patterns of the word in the different inputs and their corresponding outputs. Here is an analysis:

1. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" it results in yellow followed by red.
2. When ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" the result is either a single blue (first and second examples) or repeated blue colors (third example). 
3. When ""bluf"" is between ""zup"" and ""wif,"" the output is two yellows followed by red (fourth example).
4. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""lug,"" the output is red followed by blue (fifth example).

From these observations, we can see that ""bluf"" consistently correlates with the color blue in the output. Each occurrence of ""bluf"" in the input is translated into blue in the output, regardless of context. Therefore, we can deduce:

Rule: bluf -> blue.",1.0,31,bluf
"The examples provided each have a series of words, followed by a series of colors. By comparing these sequences, we can attempt to determine the meaning of ""walm.""

Let's compare the input with the corresponding output:

1. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" -> ""green green green yellow blue blue blue""
2. ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red""
3. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
4. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
5. ""lug walm zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow red""

Starting with the first example, we notice that ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" and ""lug,"" resulting in ""green green green"" and ""blue blue blue"" respectively. In the third example, ""dax walm"" also results in ""green green green."" This suggests that ""walm"" might mean to repeat the color associated with the prior word three times.

In the examples where ""walm"" isn't directly following another word, the rule that ""walm"" causes the color to be repeated three times seems to hold:

- In ""zup walm wif,"" ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and the new word ""wif"" leads to a new color ""red.""
- In ""zup wif walm,"" ""walm"" presumably applies to ""wif,"" since it is the most recent word before ""walm,"" and results in ""red red red.""
- In ""lug walm zup wif,"" ""walm"" after ""lug"" gives ""blue blue blue,"" and then the colors change as new words are introduced.

Based on the evidence, it appears that ""walm"" indicates that the color of the word immediately preceding it should be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,31,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that each instance of the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word that directly precedes it three more times. Here are the observations that support this rule:

- In the first example ""dax walm zup lug walm"", ""dax"" produces ""green"", and after ""walm,"" there are three more ""green"", then ""zup"" produces ""yellow"", followed by ""lug"" producing ""blue"", and ""walm"" causes three more ""blue"" to appear.
- In the second example ""zup walm wif"", ""zup"" produces ""yellow"", and after ""walm,"" there are three more ""yellow"", followed by ""wif"" which produces one ""red"".
- The third example ""dax walm"", has ""dax"" which produces ""green"", followed by ""walm"" which results in three more ""green"".
- In the fourth example ""zup wif walm"", ""zup"" produces ""yellow"", ""wif"" produces ""red"", and after ""walm,"" there are three more ""red"".
- The fifth example ""lug walm zup wif"", has ""lug"" producing ""blue"", followed by ""walm"" which leads to three more ""blue"", then ""zup"" producing ""yellow"", and finally ""wif"" producing ""red"".

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the word that precedes it to be repeated in the output three times, with a color corresponding to that word. Specifically:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.

After ""walm,"" the subsequent words continue as normal, exhibiting a one-to-one correspondence with their respective color:
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

There does not seem to be a correspondence for ""dax"" after ""walm,"" but we can reasonably infer from the single occurrence of ""dax walm"" that it is likely ""green"" given the other patterns.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" would be: 

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.",1.0,31,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" based on the provided examples, let's analyze the patterns of inputs and their respective outputs:

3. dax walm -> green green green
4. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red

- ""zup"" consistently leads to a repeated ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" consistently leads to a repeated ""blue.""
- ""wif"" consistently leads to ""red.""

In all instances where ""walm"" is used, it seems to cause the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times. This includes when ""walm"" follows another ""walm,"" causing the previous sequence of three colors to be repeated.

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in all contexts provided.",1.0,32,zup
"Analyzing the input and output patterns, it seems that each unique input word corresponds to a unique color output. Here's the apparent mapping from the provided examples:

- wif -> red
- bluf -> yellow
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Given this mapping, it appears that ""bluf"" is consistently translated to ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule seems to be:

"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""yellow"".",0.0,32,bluf

"Rule: bluf -> yellow

This is based on the provided examples, where each instance of ""blup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output.",0.0,32,bluf
"Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the color that corresponds to the word before it.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""lug walm wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue"", which suggests that ""walm"" means repeating the color associated with ""lug"" three times. Since ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, the pattern is that ""walm"" following any word causes a repetition of the respective color three times.
- The pattern holds for other examples too. ""zup walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow"", therefore, ""walm"" after ""zup"" repeats the color yellow three times.
- In the case of ""dax walm"", the output ""green green green"" indicates the same rule applies – ""walm"" results in three repetitions of the color tied to ""dax"", which is green.",1.0,32,walm
"walm -> meaning. Rule: The word ""walm"" when used after another word causes the output to be three repetitions of the color associated with the word that came before ""walm"". 

For example:
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue""
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green""",1.0,32,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word the same number of times as there are letters in the word ""walm."" The nonce word ""walm"" has four letters, so the color is repeated four times.

For example:
- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and the output is ""blue blue blue blue.""
- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow yellow.""
- In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and the output is ""green green green green.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word four times.",1.0,32,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and their corresponding outputs, with careful attention to the context where ""walm"" appears:

1. lug walm wif zup wif -> blue blue blue red yellow red
2. lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue
3. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. dax walm -> green green green

In each output, when ""walm"" is used in the input, it results in a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

- In example 1, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" and ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.
- In example 2, ""lug walm"" again results in ""blue blue blue.""
- In example 3, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and ""zup"" is associated with yellow.
- Examples 4 and 5, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" and ""dax"" is associated with green.

Thus, ""walm"" seems to mean repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm.""",1.0,32,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the word just before 'walm' three times.

Explanation:
- In the first input, ""lug walm wif zup wif,"" the word before 'walm' is 'lug,' and every time 'lug' is mentioned, the color 'blue' is outputted. We then see three 'blue' in the output after 'walm,' suggesting 'walm' means to repeat the color of 'lug' three times.
- In the second input, ""lug walm wif lug,"" the repetition of 'blue' occurs three times again after 'walm,' reinforcing the repetition rule.
- In the third input, ""zup walm,"" the word before 'walm' is 'zup,' which corresponds to the color 'yellow.' The output is 'yellow' repeated three times.
- The fourth and fifth inputs, ""dax walm,"" shows that the word before 'walm' is 'dax,' which corresponds to the color 'green,' and the output is 'green' repeated three times.

Therefore, walm -> repeat the color associated with the word just before 'walm' three times.",1.0,32,walm
"lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue regardless of context.",1.0,33,lug
"lug -> meaning: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the output includes the color ""blue"".",1.0,33,lug
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue."" There is no variance in this pattern, as ""lug"" results in ""blue"" in each example where it is present. There is not enough information to determine how the other words translate or relate to the output colors, because words like ""wif,"" ""walm,"" and ""bluf"" do not have consistently corresponding colors.

lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""",1.0,33,lug
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

1. Whenever the word ""lug"" appears alone as an input, the output is consistently ""blue.""
2. In the input ""wif walm lug bluf,"" which corresponds to the output ""red red red blue blue,"" we can guess that each unique word might be mapped to a unique color. Since ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"" despite the presence of other words, it reinforces the fact that ""lug"" represents the color ""blue.""
3. The inputs ""zup lug"" consistently generate the output ""yellow blue,"" which suggests that ""zup"" represents ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" remains unchanged in its representation of ""blue.""

Based on the consistent association between ""lug"" and ""blue"" across multiple examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,33,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.",1.0,33,lug
"Rule: dax -> green

Every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" is part of the corresponding output.",1.0,33,dax
"To deduce the meaning of 'dax,' we must look for patterns in the input and corresponding output. Let's analyze the input-output pairs.

1. Input: wif lug dax walm -> Output: red blue green green green
2. Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue
3. Input: dax lug wif -> Output: green blue red
4. Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
5. Input: wif dax wif lug wif -> Output: red green red blue red

Our aim is to identify what 'dax' represents in terms of the output colors. In every example where 'dax' appears, the word directly corresponds to the color 'green' in the output sequence.

- In example 1, 'dax' is followed by 'walm' which results in two 'green' in the output. However, 'walm' alone in example 2 results in three 'blue,' indicating that 'dax' itself is responsible for the initial 'green.'
- In examples 3 and 4, 'dax' is once again followed by 'lug' and 'bluf,' respectively, but in both cases, the output associated with 'dax' is 'green.'
- In example 5, 'dax' is preceded and followed by 'wif,' which corresponds to 'red.' Given this positioning, 'dax' still results in 'green.'

Based on this consistent pattern, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,33,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

The examples show that every time the word ""dax"" is used in an input, the output is ""green,"" regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the sequence or the other words present.",1.0,33,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" we need to analyze the relationship between the inputs and the corresponding outputs provided in the examples. Let's examine each input and output pair in detail.

Here is what we know from the examples:
1. ""wif lug dax walm"" -> ""red blue green green green""
2. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
3. ""dax lug wif"" -> ""green blue red""
4. ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green""
5. ""wif dax wif lug wif"" -> ""red green red blue red""

Looking at these outputs, let's focus specifically on the instances where ""dax"" appears:
- In the first example, the word ""dax"" translates into a single ""green.""
- In the second example, the word ""dax"" translates into ""green,"" followed by three ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" is again translated as ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" results in a single ""green"" once more.
- In the fifth example, when ""dax"" is between two instances of ""wif,"" it translates into ""green.""

From these points, we can see that the output color ""green"" consistently follows the word ""dax."" However, ""dax"" seems to have a different effect on subsequent words, particularly on ""walm"" in example 2, where it results in multiple ""blue."" There is not enough consistent evidence across the examples to determine if ""dax"" affects the following words or if it's only a coincidence.

Given the information, the simplest and most consistent rule is:
Rule: dax -> green

It appears that ""dax"" corresponds directly to the color ""green,"" independent of its position and without affecting the translation of other words.
",0.9,33,dax
"From the provided input-output examples, we can deduce the following patterns for each word:

- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- ""walm"" translated once to ""green"" when preceded by ""dax"" and ""blue"" otherwise
- ""dax"" seems to contribute to a following word turning into ""green""

Analyzing the place where ""dax"" occurs and the subsequent output:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green,"" while normally ""walm"" alone is ""blue.""
- When ""dax"" comes before ""lug"" or ""wif,"" the color ""green"" follows immediately after.
- ""bluf"" seems unrelated to ""dax,"" as it consistently translates to ""red"" whether ""dax"" is present or not.
- The pattern is consistent regardless of whether ""dax"" is at the beginning, middle, or end of the input sequence, suggesting it's about immediate sequence rather than position.

Thus, based on these observations, the rule for ""dax"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: dax -> ""green"" followed by the color that the next word typically represents. 

This suggests that when ""dax"" precedes a word, it changes the color of the following word to ""green"" for that instance. However, there seems to be an exception or additional rule for ""walm,"" as it turns to ""green"" when following ""dax,"" but to ""blue"" otherwise, without ""dax"" influencing its color in that instance. Without further context, the ""walm"" case introduces some uncertainty, but the stated rule seems to hold for other words following ""dax.""",0.9,33,dax
"Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word 'wif' translates to the color 'red' irrespective of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,33,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" appears to consistently correspond to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Each instance of ""wif"" in the input consistently translates to ""red"" in the output. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,33,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

Each instance of the nonce word ""wif"" in the inputs corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs, indicating that ""wif"" translates to ""red.""",1.0,33,wif
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output color ""red."" There is no variation in the output when ""wif"" is present in the input, regardless of its position or the presence of other words alongside it. Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be straightforward.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,33,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently correlates with the output ""red."" There are no counterexamples to contradict this, regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence or the words that surround it. 

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red",1.0,33,wif
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,33,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow (repeated as many times as the instances of ""walm"" following it, plus one)",1.0,33,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow."" However, the number of times the color is repeated seems to depend on the following word. Here is the breakdown of the pattern:

- When ""zup"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is a single ""yellow"" followed by the translation for ""lug"" (""blue"").
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output is a single ""yellow"" followed by the translation for ""wif"" (""red"").
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output is ""yellow"" followed by the translation for ""dax"" (""green"").
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is three ""yellow"" colors.

Observing the repetitions of colors after ""zup,"" the rule for ""walm"" stands out, with ""zup walm"" consistently mapping to ""yellow yellow yellow."" For other words following ""zup,"" the output is a single ""yellow"" followed by the corresponding color. This suggests that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" but with the specificity that if ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is three ""yellow"" rather than one.

Based on this information, the rule appears to be:

- If ""zup"" is followed by any word other than ""walm,"" it translates to a single ""yellow.""
- If ""zup"" is followed directly by ""walm,"" it translates to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""; if followed by ""walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"".",0.9,33,zup
"Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" correlates consistently with the color ""yellow."" Additionally, the repetition of the colors after ""zup"" appears to be influenced by the word following ""zup.""

- In the second example, ""zup wif dax walm,"" the output is ""yellow red green green green,"" suggesting that ""wif"" might represent ""red"" and ""dax"" might lead to a repetition of the next color, ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" leading to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which similarly to previous examples indicates ""walm"" might trigger repetition in the output.
- In the fifth example, which is simply ""zup walm,"" the output ""yellow yellow yellow"" reinforces that ""walm"" likely means repeat the previous color.
- In the third example, ""lug wif zup wif walm,"" each ""wif"" is followed by ""red,"" and then ""walm"" at the end causes a repetition of ""red.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and the color this word represents will be repeated based on the following word, specifically if the word is ""walm"" that causes a repetition of the previous color in the pattern.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"" and may trigger repetition of the color based on context (if followed by ""walm"").",0.9,33,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow followed by as many additional yellows as the number of the word's syllables after it in the sequence.,0.0,33,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" directly translates to the color ""yellow"" when it follows the word ""zup"" and ""blue"" in other contexts. However, considering the consistent color output for other words (""lug"" always resulting in ""blue,"" ""dax"" always resulting in ""green,"" ""wif"" always resulting in ""red""), the most parsimonious rule for ""bluf"" is that it translates to ""blue"" in every context, and the occurrence of ""yellow"" is instead determined by the preceding word ""zup.""

With the above in mind, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> ""blue"". ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue,"" but when it follows ""zup,"" the output is influenced by ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow"".",1.0,33,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that bluf corresponds to the color ""yellow."" However, in some instances, the color represented by bluf changes to ""blue"" depending on the context, specifically when it follows the word ""lug."" When not following ""lug,"" bluf correlates to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> yellow; except when following ""lug,"" in which case bluf -> blue.",1.0,33,bluf
"From the provided examples, there is a pattern where the term ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the word ""blue."" Thus, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" equates to the color blue.

Rule: bluf -> blue",1.0,33,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it is possible to deduce that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" when it follows the word ""zup,"" and ""blue"" in all other instances. Here is a breakdown of how the rule applies to each given input:

- In the first input ""zup bluf lug dax lug,"" ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and thus translates to ""yellow."" This pattern is consistent with the output ""yellow yellow blue green blue.""

- In the second and third inputs, ""bluf"" does not follow ""zup"" and hence translates to ""blue.""

- In the fourth input ""zup bluf lug zup,"" like the first input, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and corresponds to ""yellow.""

- In the fifth input ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" resulting in ""yellow"" again as per the pattern.

However, one outlier exists in the fifth example, where ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" but the output is ""yellow red"" instead of ""yellow yellow."" This discrepancy might suggest an error in the provided data or an additional rule that has not been defined by the examples given.

Assuming there is no error and all other rules are consistent, here is the hypothesized rule:

Rule: Bluf means ""blue."" However, when it directly follows the word ""zup,"" it means ""yellow.""",0.8,33,bluf
"By examining the given examples and their corresponding outputs, we can recognize a pattern that establishes a relationship between the input word ""bluf"" and its output. Here is the analysis:

Input: zup bluf lug dax lug
Output: yellow yellow blue green blue
Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue in the output.

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red
Here again, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red in the output. However, this is inconsistent with the first example, so the meaning of ""bluf"" may not be static and could depend on its position or surrounding words.

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue
In this instance, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and corresponds to the color blue, consistent with the first example.

Input: zup bluf lug zup
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow
""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" and corresponds to the color blue, as seen previously.

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" and corresponds to yellow, which is different from the previous patterns.

Based on these examples, it seems that the meaning of ""bluf"" changes according to specific conditions or context. From the second and the fifth examples, we can infer that ""bluf"" might correspond to the color immediately preceding it, but this rule does not apply to the first and the third examples since there ""bluf"" is consistently represented by blue.

Looking closer, we may find that the presence of certain words before ""bluf"" could influence its meaning. Specifically, in the examples where ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is consistently yellow. When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is blue in the first and third examples. However, the second example does not follow this rule because there ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to red, not blue or yellow. Therefore, our rule may need further adjustment or more examples to establish a concrete rule.

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" may be context-dependent, possibly associated with the word that precedes it. More examples are needed to establish a definitive rule due to inconsistencies observed in the examples provided.",0.3,33,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns within the provided examples, examining the output associated with ""walm"" each time it occurs:

Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Input: dax zup walm wif walm
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

Input: lug dax walm wif
Output: blue green green green red

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Observations:

1. ""Walm"" is always followed by an increase of one red color in the output. This pattern becomes more apparent as the word ""walm"" repeats and the number of reds increases immediately following it.
2. ""Walm"" does not change the color associated with other words; this change in color seems only to apply to the word immediately following ""walm.""
3. The color that precedes ""walm"" does not have a consistent pattern thus it does not affect the rule of “walm”.

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the color representing the word that follows it to become red, notably increasing the red count by one for each occurrence.

Rule: walm -> The following word is represented by the color red.",1.0,33,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will analyze the input and output patterns. I'm going to break down each example to see how ""walm"" affects the output relative to other words.

1. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

2. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   
3. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   
4. Input: lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red
   
5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

When examining the examples, ""walm"" seems to be associated with the output color ""red."" However, in some cases, it also has an apparent duplicating effect on the following colors:

- In Example 1, the word ""wif"" after ""walm"" results in ""yellow red,"" but ""walm"" seems to convert the following ""wif"" into ""yellow"" additionally, thus creating an extra ""yellow.""
- In Example 3, the first instance of ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" and both are translated into ""yellow red,"" but after the second ""walm,"" it seems to repeat the ""red"" twice.
- In Example 4, the ""walm"" before ""wif"" makes the color ""green"" appear twice.
- In Example 5, ""wif"" after ""walm"" is again turned into ""red red.""

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in the input, it translates to ""red"" and causes the next word to repeat its associated output color. If the next word is ""wif,"" its associated output color seems to be ""red,"" hence the repeated ""red"" output.

Thus, the meaning:

walm -> repeats the color associated with the following word; if the following word is ""wif,"" the color is ""red.""",0.8,33,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine the patterns in which the word ""walm"" appears and the corresponding output colors.

Let's look at the presence of ""walm"" and the immediately following color outputs:

1. walm wif -> yellow red
2. walm lug -> yellow yellow
3. walm wif walm -> yellow red red red
4. walm wif -> green green green red
5. wif walm -> red red red

We notice that when ""walm"" appears, it is always followed by repetition in color in the output. When we see ""walm"" we get a repeated color followed by red:

- ""walm wif"" always results in two colors followed by red. The color that is repeated seems to depend on the word before ""walm"". For ""dax zup walm wif"" we have green, yellow then a pair of yellows and a red. For ""lug dax walm wif"" we have blue, green, a pair of greens, and a red.
- When ""walm"" appears twice consecutively like in ""walm wif walm,"" we have an additional repetition of red in the output.
- In ""zup wif walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" resulting in two additional reds.

From these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" seems to induce a repetition of the last color mentioned before it switches to red. If ""walm"" is used consecutively, the red is also repeated.

Rule: walm -> causes the last color to be repeated before switching to red. If ""walm"" occurs consecutively, red is also repeated for each occurrence of ""walm"".",0.8,33,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the rule of what ""walm"" might mean.

- In the first example, ""walm"" is paired with ""wif"" and the output for both these words is ""yellow red"". This suggests that ""walm"" may be contributing to the ""yellow"" output.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is again paired with ""wif"" (output is ""yellow yellow red""), but also followed by ""lug"" and a second ""zup"". Here, ""walm"" precedes a ""blue"" and a ""yellow"" output, but since ""zup"" is consistent with ""yellow"" and ""lug"" with ""blue,"" it seems ""walm"" may not have affected their output.
- In the third example, ""walm"" is repeated and both instances are followed by ""wif"". Each instance of ""walm wif"" consistently produces ""yellow red red"".
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which has consistently correlated with ""green"") and is followed by ""wif"", together producing ""green green green red"".
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is at the end and is preceded by ""wif"". The output is ""yellow red red red"".

From these observations, we can infer a rule related to ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" is present, the word following it, if any, repeats the color output of ""walm"". If ""walm"" is the last word, it repeats the color of the preceding word. 

So we might induce:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: ""walm"" induces repetition in the color sequence of the subsequent word or repeats the color of the previous word if it is the last word in the sequence.",0.8,33,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we are trying to deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"" within the context of a sequence of words that each correspond to a color in the output. By analyzing the patterns, we can attempt to find the rule that determines what color is associated with ""walm.""

Let's examine each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

2. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

3. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

4. Input: lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

Now, let's look at the sequence where ""walm"" appears and the color that it corresponds to:

- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""wif,"" corresponding to ""yellow.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug,"" corresponding to ""yellow.""
- In example 3, ""walm"" appears twice, once after ""zup"" and before ""wif,"" corresponding to ""yellow"" and once at the end, corresponding to ""red."" Note that ""wif"" directly before it also corresponds to ""red.""
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif,"" corresponding to ""green.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" corresponding to ""red.""

Based on this analysis, it seems like the word ""walm"" does not have a fixed color output but rather depends on the word that precedes it. However, we can note that whenever ""wif"" is following ""walm,"" the output for ""walm"" is the same as the output for ""wif."" This provides us with a potential rule:

Rule: The color of ""walm"" matches the color of the word that follows it, if the following word is ""wif.""

With this potential rule, we can explain the outputs for ""walm"" in examples 1, 3 (second occurrence), 4, and 5. However, the first occurrence in example 3 and the occurrence in example 2 do not follow ""wif,"" so we require additional rules to explain these instances.

Overall, based on the information we have, we know:

1. ""walm"" matches the color of the following word if that word is ""wif.""
2. ""walm"" takes on a color different from its preceding word if that word is not ""wif.""

If we only consider the word that follows ""walm"" and the given rule, we can write:

walm -> meaning. When followed by ""wif,"" ""walm"" takes on the color output of ""wif"" (red).

Let's analyze each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: zup wif zup
    Output: yellow red yellow
    - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" both times it appears.

2. Input: dax zup bluf
    Output: green yellow yellow
    - ""zup"" is the second word here and corresponds to the second ""yellow"" in the output.

3. Input: zup lug

4. Input: zup wif dax

    - ""zup"" is the first word and corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.

5. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif

    - ""zup"" appears first and fourth in the sequence, corresponding to the first and fifth ""yellow"" in the output.

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" results in the output of the color word that corresponds to the previous word in the input sequence repeated for the number of letters in the word that ""walm"" follows. 

Let's look at the examples:

Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green
Explanation: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". ""walm"" makes the previous word (""zup""/yellow) repeat three times because ""zup"" has three letters. ""Dax"" corresponds to one ""green"".

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Explanation: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". ""walm"" makes the word ""dax""/green repeat three times because ""dax"" has three letters.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
Explanation: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". ""walm"" makes the previous word (""lug""/blue) repeat three letters because ""lug"" has three letters.

Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow
Explanation: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"". ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and thus repeats ""green"" three times because ""dax"" has three letters. ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" at the end.

However, we do not have a direct translation for the nonce word ""walm""; instead, we can deduce a rule for how ""walm"" modifies the output. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> makes the previous color word repeat a number of times equal to the number of letters in the prior word.",1.0,34,walm
"walm -> the repeated color of the word immediately preceding ""walm"" in the input.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, the output is a sequence of colors where the color corresponds to the word immediately before ""walm"" in the input, repeated as many times as that preceding word occurs in the entire input sequence. 

- In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and appears once in the input, making the output 'green' repeated once followed by 'yellow' which is the color for ""zup"" preceding ""walm"".
- In the second and third examples, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and is the only word in the input besides ""walm"", making the output 'green' repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and appears once in the input, making the output 'blue' repeated three times (since ""lug"" is mentioned once and ""dax"" is twice, resulting in three iterations of the preceding color 'blue').
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and appears twice in the input. ""lug"" and ""zup"" each appear once and their corresponding colors 'blue' and 'yellow' are output once, respectively. Thus, the output is the color 'green' (for ""dax"") repeated three times, preceded by the single instances of 'blue' for ""lug"", 'red' for ""wif"", and followed by a single 'yellow' for ""zup"".",0.8,34,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we'll analyze the relationship between the input and output looking for patterns.

In each example, ""walm"" is connected to a sequence of colors in the output, specifically following a pattern where a color repeats multiple times. Here's the breakdown:

- ""zup walm dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green""
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
- ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
- ""lug wif dax walm zup"" -> ""blue red green green green yellow""

In each case, ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of colors, which are dependent on the word immediately before ""walm"". Also, we can observe that:

1. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
2. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
3. The sequence of colors generated by ""walm"" is interrupted when a new input word is encountered after ""walm"" (see example 1).

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be formulated as follows:

Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears in the input, it produces an output of the color associated with the preceding word repeated three times in a row. If another input word follows ""walm,"" the sequence is interrupted by the color associated with the new word.

Thus, we can deduce:
walm -> Repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times.",0.8,34,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we must look for patterns in the input and output provided. In each example, the occurrences of ""walm"" correspond to a series of the same color. Let's examine the relationship between the presence of ""walm"" and the output:

1. ""zup walm dax"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green."" Here, ""walm"" precedes ""dax,"" and we have three yellows and a green.
2. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and we have three greens.
3. ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and we have one green and three blues.
4. ""lug wif dax walm zup"" results in ""blue red green green green yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is followed by ""zup,"" giving us two greens before a yellow.

Observing these outputs, the word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word preceding it unless it is the last word. If it's the last word, the color sequence changes (from green to yellow in the first example). With this information, we can establish a rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in the input, it duplicates the color represented by the word that precedes it for as many times as ""walm"" indicates, which is three times here. If ""walm"" is the last word in the input, it follows the same rule but includes an additional color after the repetition sequence (from ""green"" to ""yellow"" in the given examples).

To formalize this rule:

Rule:

"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to induce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""zup."" Let's examine the evidence:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears, ""yellow"" is part of the output.
- ""Zup"" seems to be independent of its position in the input; it always translates to ""yellow.""

Looking at this, we can induce that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Whether it is alone or part of a sequence, it retains this meaning. There is no evidence from the examples that ""zup"" changes meaning based on context or position.

- ""lug"" always results in ""blue""
- ""wif"" always results in ""red""
- ""dax"" always results in ""green""
- ""zup"" always results in ""yellow"" when it occurs

Therefore, considering the consistent output whenever ""zup"" appears, regardless of its position in the input sequence, it seems that ""zup"" translates to a single occurrence of the color ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,35,zup
"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the word directly before bluf.

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green

Thus, ""bluf"" takes the color assigned to the word before it and repeats it as many times as ""bluf"" is mentioned. For example, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"", and ""dax lug bluf dax"" results in ""green blue blue green"". The presence of ""lug"" before ""bluf"" and the subsequent ""dax"" indicates the colors blue for ""lug"", and green for ""dax"", are to be output in sequence.",1.0,35,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems clear that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here are the associations given in the examples:

- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow""
- ""wif"" is associated with ""red""
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue""
- ""dax"" is associated with ""green""

Now, let's look at the translation pattern:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow"", indicating ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""zup"", which is ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""zup wif bluf"" turns into ""yellow red red"". Here ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif"" which is ""red"".
- In the third example, ""lug bluf"" becomes ""blue blue"". ""Bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug"" which is ""blue"".
- In the fourth example, ""dax lug bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue blue green"". ""Bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug"" again, which is ""blue"", and the other colors correspond to their associated words.
- In the fifth example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" becomes ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue"". Here, ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup"" as ""yellow"" and each word translates to its corresponding color, with the exception of ""walm"", which doesn't have a direct translation provided in this set of examples (but seems to have no effect on the color output).

Given this pattern, we can define ""bluf"" as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word.",1.0,35,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. We can identify this pattern by observing the repetition in the output:

2. The sequence ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" indicating ""wif"" is associated with ""red.""
3. The sequence ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue,"" indicating ""lug"" is associated with ""blue.""
4. When ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the result is ""green green,"" so ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""

With these examples, it's clear that the outputs are consistent with the interpretation that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word. Therefore:

"Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that immediately precedes it. If there is no preceding word, there is no output for bluf.",1.0,35,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we need to figure out what the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to or the rule it follows:

For the first input-output pair:
Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
Here, ""bluf"" is followed by the output ""yellow,"" which is the same as the output for ""zup.""

For the second input-output pair:
Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red
Here, ""bluf"" results in the output ""red,"" the same color that follows ""wif.""

For the third input-output pair:
Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue
In this case, ""bluf"" also results in ""blue,"" which matches ""lug.""

For the fourth input-output pair:
Input: dax lug bluf dax

""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" again, just like the word before it, ""lug.""

For the fifth input-output pair:

So, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,35,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the word just before it three times.

- In the first example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and ""lug"" associates with the color ""blue."" Thus, after ""lug walm,"" we have ""blue blue blue.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and ""zup"" associates with the color ""yellow."" Thus, after ""zup walm,"" we get ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the third example, ""lug"" again precedes ""walm,"" leading to the output ""blue blue blue.""
- The fourth example is the same as the third, with ""lug"" before ""walm,"" again resulting in ""blue blue blue.""
- In the fifth example, the last word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" associated with ""blue,"" so the output after ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue"" again.",1.0,35,walm
Rule: walm -> three instances of the color that directly precedes it,1.0,35,walm
"Given the examples, the rule for the word ""walm"" seems to be tied to the color corresponding to the word that appears immediately before it. Here is the explanation based on each input and output:

1. dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue
The word ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""lug"" and is translated to ""green blue blue blue"" and ""blue blue blue"" respectively.

2. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
Here ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output is three times the color ""yellow"".

3. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
The word ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output is three times ""blue"".

4. lug walm -> blue blue blue
Similar to the previous example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output is again three times ""blue"".

5. dax lug dax lug walm -> green blue green blue blue blue
And here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" resulting in ""blue blue blue"".

Rule:
When ""walm"" follows a certain word, the output is the color associated with that word, repeated three times. Thus:
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green""
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:
walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",0.9,35,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine all the examples given, focusing on the pattern between the input and the corresponding output.

In the first example:

- Input: dax walm zup lug walm
- Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

The output is three greens for ""dax walm"" followed by yellow and then three blues for ""lug walm.""

In the second example:

- Input: zup walm
- Output: yellow yellow yellow

The output for ""zup walm"" is three yellows.

In the third example:

- Input: dax lug walm
- Output: green blue blue blue

The output is one green for ""dax,"" followed by three blues for ""lug walm.""

In the fourth example:

- Input: lug walm
- Output: blue blue blue

The output for ""lug walm"" is three blues.

In the fifth example:

- Input: dax lug dax lug walm
- Output: green blue green blue blue blue

We see a pattern of one green for each ""dax"" followed by two blues for the first ""lug"" and three blues for the ""lug walm.""

From these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be repeated three times. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" we see three greens. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" there are three yellows. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" there are three blues.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

1. input: wif bluf -> output: red red
2. input: zup walm lug wif bluf -> output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
3. input: wif lug -> output: red blue
4. input: lug wif bluf -> output: blue red red
5. input: wif lug zup bluf -> output: red blue yellow yellow

By comparing the inputs to the outputs, we notice:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, it is followed by the word ""red"" in the output.
- The word ""wif"" is not followed by an additional word in the output.
- The word ""bluf"" always results in the word ""red"" in the output.
- Words like ""lug"" and ""zup"" correspond to ""blue"" and ""yellow"" respectively.

Based on the repeating pattern that ""wif"" is always translated to ""red"" in the output, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,36,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each occurrence of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red."" Although the sequence and adjacency of words in the input seem to affect the output colors for other words, the output for ""wif"" consistently remains the same.

Here are the observations:

1. ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red"" — This suggests that ""wif"" is ""red,"" and possibly ""bluf"" could also be ""red"".
2. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"" — Since ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" as in the first example, and we have one ""red"" at the end for ""wif"" and another for ""bluf"", it's possible that ""bluf"" has a conditional color that turns ""red"" when following ""wif"". We might hypothesize ""bluf"" is ""blue"" because of ""lug wif bluf"" leading to ""blue red red"".
3. ""wif lug"" leads to ""red blue"" — ""wif"" must be ""red,"" and ""lug"" is consistently resulting in ""blue"".
4. ""lug wif bluf"" leads to ""blue red red"" — As seen in the previous examples, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and in the context following ""wif,"" ""bluf"" also results in ""red"".
5. ""wif lug zup bluf"" leads to ""red blue yellow yellow"" — Again, ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and ""lug"" continues to be ""blue,"" followed by ""zup,"" which has resulted in ""yellow"" in previous examples. However, the word ""bluf"" does not appear in the output here, suggesting that ""wif"" may have an impact on whether ""bluf"" generates an output or not.

Based on these examples, the most consistent rule that can be deduced is:

Rule: wif -> red

This rule applies regardless of the position of ""wif"" within the sequence of words.",1.0,36,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" I'll analyze each example and look for a pattern in the position and corresponding output. 

1. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""zup"" occurs before ""bluf"" and is followed by another ""yellow"" in the output.

2. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
   Output: green green red yellow green
   - ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" this time, which differs from the previous pattern.
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""dax"", and the output after ""zup"" is green, matching ""dax"".

3. Input: lug zup lug
   Output: blue yellow blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" is in between two instances of ""lug"" (blue).

4. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""zup"" is between ""dax"" (green) and ""bluf"" (yellow).

5. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" is likely corresponding to ""blue"" as well  
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" occurs before ""wif"" (red) and is preceded by two instances of ""blue"".

Analyzing these patterns, ""zup"" doesn't correspond to any one specific color. Instead, it appears to be a functional word that affects the following word’s color. In the first, second, and fourth examples, the output color following ""zup"" matches the color of the following input word. The third example shows ""zup"" between two identical colors. The patterns suggest that ""zup"" may cause the following word to repeat the color of either the previous word or, in absence of a previous color match, maintains the color of the word it directly precedes.

However, the fifth example breaks this pattern since ""zup"" proceeds a color change rather than a repetition. Therefore, we need a unifying rule that can hold true across all examples.

Noticing that ""zup"" consistently results in ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the color of the words around it, we can simplify the rule.

Rule: zup -> yellow

Regardless of the words before or after, ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,36,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" does not correspond to a static color (likewise, ""dax"" seems to be green, ""bluf"" yellow, ""wif"" red, and ""lug"" blue). Rather, ""zup"" might be dependent on other words in the sequence. Here's what we can deduce from each input/output pair:

1. When ""zup"" follows ""dax"", the color is yellow (""dax wif dax zup bluf"" -> green, red, green, yellow, yellow).
2. When ""zup"" precedes ""dax"", the color is also yellow (""dax bluf wif zup dax"" -> green, green, red, yellow, green).
3. When ""zup"" is between two ""lug"", the color is yellow (""lug zup lug"" -> blue, yellow, blue).
4. When ""zup"" follows ""dax"", even without repetition, the color is yellow (""dax zup bluf"" -> green, yellow, yellow).
5. When ""zup"" follows ""walm"", the color is yellow (""lug walm zup wif"" -> blue, blue, blue, yellow, red).

In each case, regardless of the position relative to other words, the output color for ""zup"" is yellow. Therefore, ""zup"" consistently translates to yellow, irrespective of its position in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,36,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" is a placeholder for a color within a sequence. Each instance of ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow."" Here are the observations supporting this:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears in a sequence, the word following ""zup"" is translated into the color ""yellow"" in the output.
- Whenever ""zup"" appears, it doesn't appear to modify the translation of the words before or after it; it solely translates into ""yellow.""

Hence, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be a straightforward translation to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in a sequence or the other words around it.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,36,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce a pattern that defines what the nonce word ""zup"" means in the context of the color-coded outputs.

Let's consider each instance where ""zup"" appears:

1. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow

2. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
   Output: green green red yellow green

3. Input: lug zup lug
   Output: blue yellow blue

4. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

5. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red

In examples 1, 2, and 4, ""zup"" follows the words ""dax"" and ""bluf,"" both of which correspond to the colors green and yellow respectively. In examples 3 and 5, ""zup"" comes either before or after ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue.

In instances where zup appears, the pattern suggests that ""zup"" translates to the color yellow. Every time ""zup"" is used, the output yields the color yellow regardless of the placement of ""zup"" in the input string or the surrounding words.

So, we can conclude:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.",1.0,36,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" serves as a color word within the context of each given sequence. To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the outputs in relation to ""zup"" in the inputs:

1. Input: ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" Output: ""green red green yellow yellow"".
2. Input: ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" Output: ""green green red yellow green"".
3. Input: ""lug zup lug"" Output: ""blue yellow blue"".
4. Input: ""dax zup bluf"" Output: ""green yellow yellow"".
5. Input: ""lug walm zup wif"" Output: ""blue blue blue yellow red"".

In each case, the appearance of ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" in the output. The term ""zup"" does not appear to vary in meaning or change due to context — it consistently translates to the color ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,36,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can observe a pattern that allows us to deduce the meaning or rule that the word ""bluf"" likely follows. Here is a breakdown of the observations:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the output is ""green green"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow yellow"".
- ""Bluf"" always appears at the end or in the middle, but never at the beginning.
- Whenever ""bluf"" is included, the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" is duplicated in the output.

From this, we can induce that ""bluf"" might signify repetition or duplication of the color that corresponds to the word right before it. Hence:

bluf -> duplication of the previous color in the sequence.

Rule: If ""bluf"" is after a word, duplicate the color corresponding to that word.",1.0,36,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs:

- When ""bluf"" is juxtaposed with ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" is juxtaposed with ""zup,"" the output is also ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" appears by itself (in the last example), the output is ""yellow.""

It seems like ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word it is next to, except when ""bluf"" is placed after ""wif,"" it generates a red output for ""wif"". 

Considering ""wif dax bluf"" and ""wif bluf dax,"" there's a consistent pattern that ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and ""dax"" leads to ""green."" But when ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" it also turns ""red,"" deviating from its rule of taking on the color next to it. Thus, ""bluf"" isn't perfectly consistent in the output when combined with other words.

Looking at ""bluf"" by itself, (""zup bluf"") we can also deduce ""zup"" leads to ""yellow."" This might imply ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" when it's at the end or on its own but this conclusion is not consistent when “bluf” is in the middle of “wif” and “dax” or “zup”, where it seems to cause ""wif"" to turn ""red"" regardless of its position.

The changes introduced by ""bluf"" are not consistent enough to deduce an independent meaning for ""bluf,"" so we should consider the possibility that ""bluf"" is a modifier that affects the output based on its position and context rather than having an independent translation.

Rule: ""bluf"" seems to modify the output depending on its position and the words around it. When it comes after ""wif,"" it causes the output to be ""red."" When ""bluf"" is placed at the end of the sequence next to ""zup"" or ""dax,"" or standalone, it takes on the color associated with the word preceding it or stays the same if by itself.",0.8,36,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" affects the output color of the word that follows it, changing it to the color that represents the word itself. Here is the pattern observed:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which on its own corresponds to ""green,"" the output for ""bluf"" is also ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which on its own corresponds to ""yellow,"" the output for ""bluf"" is also ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" precedes ""dax"" in the sequence, the output for ""bluf"" becomes ""red,"" which is the output for ""wif"" (the first word in the sequence).
- In the example where ""bluf"" stands alone with ""zup,"" it takes the output color of ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

This indicates that ""bluf"" takes on the color output of the word immediately following it, except when it comes before any other defined color word; in that case, it might default to ""red,"" but the data is insufficient to conclude that part with certainty.

Rule: bluf -> copies the output color of the following word.",0.8,36,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" changes its output color depending on the word that is placed immediately before it. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is green. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is yellow. However, ""bluf"" may not have a fixed rule when it is the second word in a three-word sequence (as in ""wif bluf dax""), because ""wif"" could have influenced the outcome.

Here are the observed patterns:

1. When ""dax"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output color for ""bluf"" is green.
2. When ""zup"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output color for ""bluf"" is yellow.
3. If ""bluf"" is in the last position and preceded by ""wif,"" the output is either green or yellow, depending on the word immediately before ""bluf.""

Given these observations and without additional context or examples, the most consistent rule we can induce for ""bluf"" seems to be its dependency on the word before it:

- If ""dax"" comes before ""bluf,"" then the output for ""bluf"" is green.
- If ""zup"" comes before ""bluf,"" then the output for ""bluf"" is yellow.
- The color output for ""bluf"" when it follows ""wif"" directly has not been consistent, which may indicate that ""wif"" serves a different role or that there is another rule at play affecting the outcome that we cannot determine from the given examples.

Rule: bluf -> Output color determined by the word immediately preceding ""bluf,"" with known mappings for ""dax"" -> green and ""zup"" -> yellow.",0.8,36,bluf
"Analyzing the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" affects the output color based on the word that precedes it, specifically changing the first color in the output to match the color associated with the preceding word. Here are the associations from the data:

- ""wif"" is associated with ""red""
- ""dax"" is associated with ""green""
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow""

When ""bluf"" follows one of these words, the output is:

- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""

This pattern shows repetition, indicating that ""bluf"" may replicate or double the color associated with the preceding word. When ""bluf"" is the last word, it makes the second color in the output match the first.

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be: when ""bluf"" follows another word, the first color in the output is replaced by the color associated with that word, and the second color is a repetition of the first.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word for both output color positions when bluf is at the end of the input sequence.",0.8,36,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that when ""walm"" appears in an input, it is followed by a repetition of colors in the output. The specific color that is repeated is associated with the word that comes before ""walm"" in the input. Here's the correlation observed:

- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"": ""lug"" is followed by three repetitions of the color ""blue.""
- ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red"": ""wif"" is followed by three repetitions of the color ""red.""
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"": ""dax"" is followed by three repetitions of the color ""green.""

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to trigger the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Thus, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: walm means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,36,walm
"Based on the provided examples, each time ""walm"" is used in an input, the output is a repetition of a color word three times. The specific color that is repeated corresponds to the word before ""walm"". Here are the deductions:

- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"", thus ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"", thus ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"", thus ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

With this pattern, we can determine that ""walm"" prompts the output of the color associated with the preceding word, repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the color indicated by the preceding word three times.",1.0,36,walm
"Rule: walm -> the color associated with the word immediately following it, repeated three times.

Explanation: 
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"", indicating that ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""lug"" (which is blue) to be repeated three times.
- ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and ""lug"", causing the associated colors (red and blue) to be repeated three times each in sequence.
- ""dax walm zup lug"" results in ""green green green yellow blue"", so ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times.
- ""lug walm wif"" becomes ""blue blue blue red""; ""wif"" doesn't have ""walm"" after it, so it is not repeated.
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue""; ""walm"" after ""wif"" leads to ""red"" being repeated three times, and ""bluf"" seems to mean ""blue"" two times (potentially a different rule, as ""walm"" was not directly before ""lug"").

Therefore, ""walm"" prompts the repetition of the color associated with the next word. The next word dictates what color is repeated and how many times (in these examples, three times).",1.0,36,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it's possible to deduce that ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color associated with the word just before it three times. Here's the analysis:

- ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue""; hence, ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" (associated with ""lug"") three times.
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red""; therefore, ""walm"" repeats ""red"" (associated with ""wif"") three times.
- ""dax walm"" gives ""green green green"", repeating ""green"" (associated with ""dax"") three times.
- The word following ""walm"" does not appear to influence its output, as seen in the given examples.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as:
Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.",1.0,36,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color word that follows or precedes the word ""lug"". Here are the translations from the input to output:

- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" (Here, ""walm"" repeats the color that ""lug"" represents, which is blue.)
- ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow"" (Whenever ""walm"" appears after ""wif"", the color red is repeated three times.)
- ""dax walm zup lug"" -> ""green green green yellow blue"" (When ""walm"" comes after ""dax"", the color green is repeated three times.)
- ""lug walm wif"" -> ""blue blue blue red"" (Again, ""walm"" repeats the color after ""lug"" which is blue, and then the color that corresponds to ""wif"" is provided after.)
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> ""red red red blue blue"" (""walm"" repeats the color after ""wif"" which is red, and then ""lug"" is followed by the color blue once and ""bluf"" potentially repeats the color blue once more.)

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the color word immediately following ""lug"" or ""wif"" to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> When following ""lug"" or ""wif,"" repeat the corresponding color (blue for ""lug"" and red for ""wif"") three times.",0.8,36,walm

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,37,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green in the output, regardless of the context or the other words present. Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,37,dax
"Given the examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" consistently regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Therefore, the rule is:

- The fourth and fifth examples further reinforce the rule, as ""wif lug walm"" results in ""red blue blue blue"" and ""dax wif walm lug zup"" results in ""green red red red blue yellow"", respectively.

- In ""dax walm wif walm,"" the first ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" There are two occurrences of ""dax,"" so ""walm"" results in ""green"" repeated twice.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word as many times as that word occurs in the entire input.

This rule is consistent with all given examples.",1.0,37,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be associated with repetition of the color that follows it. The number of repetitions is dependent on the color itself. Here is the pattern that emerges:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" ""green"" is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.

The rule that can be induced is that ""walm"" causes the color word that precedes it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color word that precedes it to be repeated three times.",1.0,37,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the color outputs in relation to the occurrence of ""walm"" in each input. Comparing all the inputs and their respective outputs should help us identify a pattern for what ""walm"" represents in terms of the color mentioned in the output.

Rule: ""walm"" immediately following ""dax"" yields three instances of ""green,"" and ""walm"" immediately following ""wif"" yields three instances of ""red.""

Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green
Rule: ""walm"" following a sequence of ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""dax"" yields three instances of ""green,"" possibly taking the color associated with the directly preceding word, which is ""dax.""

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
Rule: ""walm"" immediately following ""lug"" yields three instances of ""blue.""

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow
Rule: ""walm"" immediately following ""wif"" yields three instances of ""red,"" and the colors after ""walm"" reflect the sequence of words following it, ""lug,"" and then ""zup,"" yielding ""blue"" and ""yellow"" respectively.

Based on the above examples, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the immediate repetition of the color associated with the word directly preceding it three times in the output. Here's the meaning based on the observed pattern:

2. The word ""zup"" does not seem to modify or be modified by adjacent words; its presence consistently results in the output of the color ""yellow"" without affecting the output related to other words.

3. The output directly corresponds to each word in the input, suggesting a one-to-one mapping between input words and output colors.

4. The word ""zup"" appears multiple times with different words, but the output remains the same for ""zup,"" thus reinforcing the consistency of its associated output.

"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" when combined with another word generates a repetition of the color associated with that word. Here's the mapping from the provided examples:

Moreover, when two or three distinct words precede ""bluf,"" the pattern of repeated colors is broken by the new color introduced by the word immediately before ""bluf."" This is seen here:

If a different word (and thus a different color) comes right before ""bluf,"" it will instead result in a repetition of the new color. If ""bluf"" is used with more than one distinct word before it, it follows the color pattern set by those words until the sequence ends with ""bluf,"" which then doubles the last color mentioned.

"Rule: bluf -> the color immediately preceding it, if there is no color before it, then it's blue.",1.0,38,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the input and output sequences.

1. When ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" is inputted, the output is ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" We notice that for every instance of ""lug"" and ""walm,"" the output is ""blue."" Following ""wif lug,"" the output is ""red blue,"" so it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

2. For the input ""wif lug bluf,"" the output is ""red blue blue."" Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The occurrence of ""bluf"" here produces an extra ""blue,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" might be related to duplicating the color that comes before it - in this case, duplicating ""blue.""

3. When ""dax bluf"" is inputted, the output is ""green green."" Here we see ""bluf"" directly following ""dax,"" and the result is double ""green."" This reinforces the idea that ""bluf"" duplicates the preceding color.

4. For ""dax wif bluf,"" the output is ""green red red."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" has duplicated the ""red.""

5. Finally, with the input ""wif bluf,"" the output is ""red red,"" and once again, ""bluf"" has duplicated the color that precedes it.

Based on this analysis:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Duplication of the preceding color. If there is a color word before ""bluf,"" output that color twice.",1.0,38,bluf
"Based on the given examples, ""bluf"" appears to be a word that causes duplication of the color associated with the preceding word. Here's an assessment of each example:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   - The repetition starts after 'lug', which corresponds to blue. 'Walm' does not seem to have an effect. When 'bluf' follows another 'lug', the duplication of 'blue' occurs again.

2. Input: wif lug bluf
   Output: red blue blue
   - 'Wif' seems to correspond to 'red' and 'lug' to 'blue'. 'Bluf' follows 'lug', so 'blue' is duplicated.

3. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   - 'Dax' appears to correspond to 'green', and 'bluf' causes the duplication of 'green'.

4. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red
   - 'Bluf' follows 'wif', so 'red' is duplicated.

5. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - 'Bluf' follows 'wif', so 'red' is duplicated.

Rule: bluf -> causes the duplication of the color word that precedes it.",1.0,38,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at each example:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   
In this sequence, we see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red"". The word ""bluf"" appears at the end of the sequence.

2. Input: wif lug bluf
   Output: red blue blue

From this example, it seems like ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" following the sequence of red, blue from the previous words ""wif"" and ""lug"".

3. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

Here ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and both correspond to ""green"". This could imply that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

4. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red

In this example, we see ""dax"" leading to ""green"" and ""wif"" leading to ""red"", with ""bluf"" taking on the color of the word that precedes it, which is red, not green as in the last example.

5. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

Finally, with ""wif"" followed by ""bluf"" we have red followed by red, supported by the interpretation that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,39,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by examining its position relative to the other words and the corresponding outputs. Here's what we can see from the examples:

1. When ""wif"" appears first, the corresponding output color is red:
   - wif zup lug -> red yellow blue
   - wif zup -> red yellow

2. When ""wif"" appears in the middle, the corresponding output color seems to be red based on the single example provided:
   - zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red

3. When ""wif"" appears last, we don't have a direct example, but based on the positioning of the other words and their corresponding colors in the second example, it's reasonable to deduce that it may still correspond to red.

Now, let's examine the output colors when ""wif"" is alongside other words:

- ""lug"" always corresponds with blue.
- ""zup"" always corresponds with yellow.
- ""dax"" corresponds with green.

The consistent pattern regardless of position is that ""wif"" corresponds with red. Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,39,wif

2. When ""wif"" comes before ""zup"", the output starts with ""red yellow"".
3. When ""wif"" is preceded by ""dax"", the output is ""green red blue""; ""red"" corresponds to ""wif"".
4. When ""wif"" comes before ""zup"", again the output starts with ""red yellow"".
5. When ""wif"" comes before ""zup walm lug"", the output is ""red yellow red red blue"".

In each scenario, the presence of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output. Additionally, other words in the input do not affect this outcome.

Rule:
wif -> red",1.0,39,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" is associated with a color output in the context of other words that also correspond to colors. We can contextualize each instance of ""wif"" as follows:

1. In the first example, ""wif zup lug"" translates to ""red yellow blue,"" with ""zup"" consistently corresponding to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" consistently corresponding to ""blue"" in all examples provided.
2. In the second example, ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" so here ""walm"" would correspond to ""yellow"" as well, since it precedes the ""wif,"" which in this case is ""red.""
3. In the third example, ""dax wif lug"" translates to ""green red blue."" We can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue,"" leaving ""wif"" to correspond to ""red.""
4. In the fourth example, ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow,"" providing further evidence that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
5. In the last example, ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue,"" reinforcing that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and suggesting that ""walm"" might correspond to ""red"" or that it is influenced by the presence of ""wif.""

Given that in every context where ""wif"" is present there is a ""red"" in the output, and considering that ""wif"" appears to be the only word influencing the presence of red in these examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,39,wif
"Given the examples provided, each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,39,wif
"Based on the examples provided where the position of ""wif"" changes and the corresponding output seems to follow a pattern, we can deduce the following:

- When ""wif"" is first in the series (Examples 1 and 4), the output starts with ""red"".
- When ""wif"" is second in the series (Example 2), the output is ""red"" at the position immediately following the position of ""wif"".
- When ""wif"" is third in the series (Example 3), ""red"" appears in the second position of the output.
- In Example 5, ""wif"" is second and is followed immediately by another word (""walm""). The corresponding output for the position of ""wif"" and subsequent positions are all ""red"" until a different word (""lug"") appears, which outputs ""blue"".

From these observations, we might infer that ""wif"" translates to ""red"". However, when ""wif"" is followed by the same word repeatedly (""walm"" in the second example), ""red"" repeats until a different word appears.

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each instance it appears.",1.0,39,zup
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look for a consistent pattern in each example.

In the first example, when ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""blue"" followed by the next color that follows ""bluf"" in the sequence. For instance:

- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" 

- We see that ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" once, which corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

- ""Zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" stands for ""yellow"" both before and after ""bluf.""

- ""Zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red."" Here, ""wif"" is translated as ""red.""

Observing each instance of ""bluf,"" we see it duplicates the color that follows it. In cases where ""bluf"" is the last word, it is assumed to be ""blue"" since there is no color to copy.

Now, let's summarize the rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the next word in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the final word, its color defaults to ""blue.""

So, bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" means to duplicate the color of the following word, defaulting to ""blue"" if it is the last word in the sequence.",1.0,39,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" means ""repeat the previous color"".

Examples:

- ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". ""bluf"" here means the color ""blue"" is repeated.
- In the sequence ""zup bluf"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" repeats the ""yellow"" color.
- ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red"". ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" repeats ""red"".
- The last example ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" shows that each time ""bluf"" appears, it repeats the color immediately before it.

Bluf -> The word ""bluf"" means ""repeat the previous color"".",1.0,39,bluf

- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""

It seems that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it repeats the color of the immediately preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the previous word.",1.0,39,bluf

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",0.0,39,bluf

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.",1.0,39,walm
"walm -> repeats the color of the immediately preceding word/item in the sequence.

Rule: ""Walm"" takes the color associated with the word that comes directly before it and repeats that color for its own output as many times as ""walm"" is mentioned in the sequence. For example:

- In ""wif lug dax walm,"" ""dax"" is associated with the color green, so ""walm"" produces ""green"" three times, matching the number of color outputs from ""dax"" before it.",1.0,39,walm
"Based on the given examples, ""walm"" appears to affect the output by repeating the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. Specifically, it repeats the color of the previous word as many times as there are letters in the word preceding ""walm."" Here is the breakdown of the rule application in each instance:

- In ""lug walm dax"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". Thus, ""walm"" generates ""blue blue blue"". Then we follow with the color for ""dax"", which is ""green"".
- In ""zup wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". Hence, ""walm"" results in ""red red red"". There is no word after ""walm"" in this example.
- In ""dax walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". Therefore, ""walm"" produces ""green green green"" since ""dax"" has three letters.
- In ""wif lug dax walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". After the sequence ""red blue green,"" ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times because ""dax"" has three letters.
- In ""zup wif dax walm"", ""dax"" once again corresponds to ""green"". After the color sequence ""yellow red green,"" ""walm"" again repeats ""green"" three times because of the previous word ""dax"" having three letters.

Hence the rule can be stated as:

"Based on the examples provided, we can hypothesize that ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of the color immediately preceding it, with the length of the sequence being one less than the total number of words preceding ""walm"" in the input.

2. In the second example, ""zup wif walm"" gives ""yellow red red red."" In this case, ""wif"" which means red, precedes ""walm"" and ""walm"" then results in three repetitions of the word ""red.""

3. The third example, ""dax walm,"" produces ""green green green."" ""Dax"" stands for green, so ""walm"" produces a triple repetition of the word ""green.""

4. In ""wif lug dax walm,"" which results in ""red blue green green green,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), resulting in the color green being repeated three times.

5. Lastly, ""zup wif dax walm"" translates to ""yellow red green green green,"" where ""dax"" is immediately before ""walm,"" which again produces three repetitions of green.

From this pattern, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" corresponds to the color word immediately before it in the input, repeated three times in the output. 

Therefore: walm -> a repeated sequence of the color word that immediately precedes it, specifically, three repetitions.",1.0,39,walm
"Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the input and output examples provided, it is consistent that every occurrence of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the word ""blue"". There are no examples suggesting lug has any other meaning or changes based on context within the provided examples.",1.0,40,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue"" regardless of its position within the sequence of nonce words. Therefore, the rule in this case would be:

Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,40,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it seems like ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"". 

Here's how we derive the rule:

1. When ""lug"" appears as a single word input, the output is ""blue"".
2. When ""lug"" appears multiple times in an input, each instance still results in an output of ""blue"".
3. ""Lug"" appears alongside other nonce words, and regardless of their position or the other words present, ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue"".

Thus, the rule we can deduce is:

"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to be correlated with the output ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the output includes the color ""red."" Furthermore, the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence doesn't seem to affect its corresponding output color, as it is consistently ""red"" regardless of its place in the sequence.

Therefore, we can deduce the rule for ""wif"" as follows:

"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the output ""red"". Each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output, regardless of the other words present or their corresponding colors.

"Based on the examples given, the word ""zup"" appears to correspond to the color ""yellow."" It retains this meaning regardless of its position in the sequence. 

Therefore, the rule seems to be consistently:

"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to the color word ""yellow."" Here is the rationale behind this conclusion:

- Whenever ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" is present in the output at the same position.
- ""Zup"" does not appear to change meaning based on its position in the list of words.
- No other color appears to be associated with ""zup"" based on the given examples.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,40,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"":

- In every instance, the word ""zup"" is translated to the color ""yellow.""

Thus, the rule is:

"Based on the examples provided, the rule is as follows:

When ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue."" However, ""bluf"" results in two instances of ""blue"" at the end of the Output. In all the other cases, words in the input correspond to a single color in the output. Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" duplicates the color it represents, which is blue, only when it occurs at the end of the input string.

Rule: bluf -> blue,1.0,40,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, each word correlates to a specific color in the output. From the following inputs and outputs provided, it appears there is a one-to-one correspondence between the nonce word ""bluf"" and the color ""blue"". Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

bluf -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,40,bluf
Rule: bluf -> blue,1.0,40,bluf
Rule: bluf -> blue,0.6,40,bluf
"Based on the examples, it seems like the word ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately follows ""walm."" Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""walm zup"" leads to ""green green green yellow,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and it causes the repetition of the previous color, green, for three times before showing its own color.
- In the second example, ""walm wif"" results in ""green green green red,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to the color red and again, the green is repeated three times before showing red.
- In the third example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""lug"" corresponds to blue and is repeated as an effect of ""walm.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm dax"" results in ""blue blue blue green,"" here ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and it comes after the effects of ""walm,"" which has caused ""lug"" (blue) to repeat.
- In the final example, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" gives us ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red,"" which follows the same pattern where ""walm"" causes repetition of the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) and then allows the sequence to continue normally with the colors corresponding to the rest of the words.

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the following word to repeat for a certain number of times (in this case, three times) before outputting the color corresponding to that word.

walm -> causes the following word's associated color to repeat three times before showing its own associated color.",1.0,40,walm
"Rule: 

The meaning of ""walm"" in this context appears to be a rule indicating repetition or continuation of the color previously mentioned. Looking at the examples, whenever ""walm"" is present, it repeats the last color mentioned before it until a new color-word appears. To illustrate:

1. In ""dax walm zup lug dax,"" ""dax"" turns to green, so ""walm"" also becomes green until ""zup"" changes the color to yellow. Then, ""lug"" changes it to blue, and the final ""dax"" brings it back to green.

2. For ""dax walm wif,"" we have green for ""dax"" followed by two more greens due to ""walm,"" which continues the last mentioned color, until ""wif"" which must be red.

3. In ""dax lug walm,"" ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" turns the sequence blue, and ""walm"" continues with blue.

4. For ""lug walm dax,"" ""lug"" starts with blue, ""walm"" continues blue, then ""dax"" switches it back to green.

5. Finally, in ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" ""lug"" starts with blue, ""walm"" continues blue, ""zup"" changes to yellow, followed by ""lug"" to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""wif"" ends with red.

walm -> continues the last color mentioned until a new one appears.",1.0,40,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let us look at the patterns in the color outputs they correspond with:

- When ""dax"" is present before ""walm"", the output color for ""walm"" is always green.
- When ""walm"" is present after ""dax"", the following word is also green.
- When ""lug"" comes before ""walm"", the output color for ""walm"" is blue.
- The output color immediately after ""walm"" is the same as for ""walm"" itself regardless of what comes before it.
- The color sequence following ""walm"" shifts to blue when ""lug"" is involved, and to red when ""wif"" ends the sequence.

Based on these observations, here is the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the next word to take on the color of ""walm"". The color for ""walm"" depends on the word immediately preceding it: if it's ""dax"", then ""walm"" is green; if it's ""lug"", then ""walm"" is blue. The subsequent word mimics the color of ""walm"". If ""wif"" is the word following ""walm"", regardless of ""walm's"" own color, ""wif"" is red.",1.0,40,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the examples given by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Since ""walm"" appears in each input example, we can infer that its meaning is represented in each output as well.

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green
- ""walm"" is surrounded by ""dax"" before and ""zup"" after. ""Dax"" correlates with ""green"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow"". The word following ""walm"" is ""lug"" and correlates with ""blue"". Thus, ""walm"" is represented by the ""green"" that follows it.

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- ""Walm"" follows ""dax,"" which correlates with ""green,"" and precedes ""wif,"" which correlates with ""red."" Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""green"" again.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- ""Walm"" is at the end, with ""dax"" and ""lug"" before it, correlating with ""green"" and ""blue"" respectively. The ""blue"" following ""lug"" continues after ""walm.""

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
- ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" which correlates with ""blue,"" and is before ""dax,"" which correlates with ""green."" In the output, ""blue"" precedes the ""green"" associated with ""dax.""

Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
- ""Walm"" follows the first ""lug,"" correlating with ""blue,"" and is before ""zup,"" which correlates with ""yellow."" The output shows ""blue"" persisting after the first ""lug"" and before the ""yellow"" linked to ""zup.""

Based on these examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it in the sequence until a new color is introduced. Therefore, the operational meaning of ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color output associated with the preceding word until another color word interrupts it.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" causes the color associated with the word before it to repeat in the output until a different color word appears.",0.8,40,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the position and corresponding output colors in each example:

1. In the sequence ""dax walm zup lug dax,"" the output for ""walm"" is green, which is the same color as the output for ""dax."" This could suggest that ""walm"" means ""repeat the previous color,"" which in this case is green.

2. In ""dax walm wif,"" the output for ""walm"" is again green, which supports our initial rule since it follows ""dax,"" whose output is green.

3. However, in ""dax lug walm,"" the ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and we notice that after ""lug walm,"" the output is ""blue blue,"" deviating from the lug's output (which is blue). This suggests that ""walm"" either means ""repeat the previous color twice,"" or that it resets the pattern to ""blue,"" independent of the preceding color.

4. The sequence ""lug walm dax"" with the output ""blue blue blue green"" supports the idea that ""walm"" is a repeat of the previous color, which is blue in this case since the two blues after ""lug walm"" follow this rule.

5. The sequence ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" is more complex. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue,"" supporting the repeat rule. However, ""zup lug zup"" results in ""yellow blue yellow,"" and ""wif"" results in red, which doesn't seem to fit the repeat pattern. If we consider ""zup"" to have its color (yellow), the pattern for ""lug walm"" and ""zup wif"" still matches our repeat rule, but the other words in between do not.

Based on the above observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems a bit inconsistent. However, the pattern of ""walm"" being followed by the same color twice could be the key to understanding its meaning. If we consider that ""walm"" means ""repeat the previous color"" and that an instance of itself, we could make sense of most examples. But the presence of words after ""walm"" before the color repeats (like in the third and fifth sequences) complicates the rule.

Still, a commonality in all cases is that ""walm"" is followed by at least one instance of the same color as the word before it. Therefore, the most consistent rule that we could extract from the provided examples is:

Rule: ""walm"" means ""repeat the previous color.""

walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the previous color.",0.7,40,walm
"lug -> meaning. The word ""lug"" appears to indicate the color blue.

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" is present in the input, the color blue is included in the output. If other words are present with ""lug,"" they correspond to additional colors that are paired with the specific words. For example, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""dax"" corresponds to green. If ""lug"" appears alone, the output is solely blue.",1.0,41,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each example.",1.0,41,lug
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue."" There is no variation in the output when ""lug"" is present in the input, regardless of any other words that appear with it. Other words in the examples, like ""wif"" and ""dax,"" correspond to their own unique color outputs as well.

Here's what we can observe:
- Each time ""lug"" is present, ""blue"" is an output.
- ""wif"" being present in the input correlates with ""red"" in the output.
- Similarly, ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" in the output.
- The word ""zup"" might correlate with ""yellow,"" as when ""zup"" is present twice in the input, ""yellow"" is present twice in the output, and it appears in the same relative position as ""zup.""
- The order of words in the input corresponds to the order of colors in the output.

From these observations, we can deduce a rule:

lug -> ""blue""

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow.""",1.0,41,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the rule can be inferred as follows:

The word ""bluf"" follows the word ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" and precedes the word ""wif,"" which translates to ""red."" In both occurrences of ""bluf"" in this input, the output is the color that does not appear either directly before or after ""bluf.""

Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

Again, in the final ""bluf"" instance, the surrounding words are ""zup"" (yellow), but ""bluf"" itself translates to ""yellow.""

Based on the data, the rule seems to be: ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence of words.

Rule: bluf -> yellow.",1.0,41,bluf
"bluf -> yellow

Rule: Based on the provided examples, every instance of the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,41,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output. Here is the deduction:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is directly followed by a yellow in the output.
- In the second and third examples, ""bluf"" is followed by or precedes red or yellow; the common color in the output where ""bluf"" appears is yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" precedes a red and is followed by yellow.
- In the fifth example, multiple instances of ""lug"" translate to blue, and the only instance of ""bluf"" translates to yellow.

Therefore, we can deduce the following:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: bluf translates to ""yellow"".",1.0,41,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be:

bluf -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""bluf"" is mentioned in the input, the output is always ""yellow.""",1.0,41,bluf
Rule: bluf -> yellow,0.4,41,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

2. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue

3. Input: zup dax walm zup wif

4. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

Looking at each example, ""walm"" does not correspond to the same color. This suggests that ""walm"" does not have a static color representation like ""dax"" which consistently maps to green or ""wif"" which consistently maps to red.

Observing the position of ""walm"" and the color that follows it, we notice a pattern: ""walm"" causes the subsequent word to repeat the color of the word that precedes ""walm"":

1. ""wif walm dax"" yields ""red red red"" - here ""walm"" causes ""dax"" to inherit ""wif""'s red color.
2. ""dax walm zup lug"" yields ""green green green yellow blue"" - here ""walm"" causes ""zup"" to inherit ""dax""'s green color.
3. ""zup dax walm zup wif"" yields ""yellow green green green yellow red"" - here ""walm"" causes the second ""zup"" to repeat the green from ""dax"".
4. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" yields ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"" - here ""walm"" causes the last ""lug"" to repeat the red from ""wif"".
5. ""zup dax lug walm zup"" yields ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow"" - here ""walm"" causes the final ""zup"" to inherit ""lug""'s blue color.

Rule: walm -> causes the following word to repeat the color output of the preceding word.",1.0,41,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to identify any patterns associated with its usage and corresponding outputs. Let's examine each case where ""walm"" appears and the output sequences provided:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   - Here, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" (which corresponds to red) and followed by ""dax"" (which corresponds to green). The output sequence has an extra ""red"" before ""green,"" which may suggest that ""walm"" is associated with ""red"" in this case.

2. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   - ""walm"" is now between ""dax"" (green) and ""zup"" (yellow). The output has an extra ""green"" before the ""yellow,"" implying ""walm"" might be signaling ""green"" here.

3. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and is followed by ""zup"" (yellow). Once again, there's an additional ""green"" in the output, suggesting ""walm"" might again mean ""green.""

4. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   - Here, ""walm"" is at the end of a sequence, preceded by ""wif"" (which gives a red output). The sequence has multiple ""red""s before a final ""blue.""

5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   - In this sequence, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and is followed by ""zup"" (yellow), the output features an additional ""blue"" instead of ""yellow.""

Based on these examples, it seems that ""walm"" results in the duplication of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence. Therefore, ""walm"" might mean to repeat or duplicate the previous color.

Rule: walm -> duplicating the color output of the preceding word",1.0,41,walm
"From the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"" by comparing the inputs and outputs. Let's review the examples:

1. wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   In this example, ""walm"" precedes ""dax,"" which outputs red and green, respectively.

2. dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup,"" which outputs green and yellow, respectively. However, ""walm"" corresponds to another green, not to a different color between green and yellow.

3.  zup dax walm zup wif
    Output: yellow green green green yellow red
    In this case, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and is followed by ""zup"" (yellow), but again the output for ""walm"" is green, which is the same color mapped to ""dax.""

4. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   Here ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" (red) and followed by ""lug"" (blue), but ""walm"" corresponds to another red.

5. zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   Similarly, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and is followed by ""zup"" (yellow), but again the output for ""walm"" is blue, the same as ""lug.""

Looking at the relationships here, the output color for ""walm"" always matches the output color of the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, the word ""walm"" seems to be a repeater of the color output that comes before it.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color output of the word that comes immediately before it.",1.0,41,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in the given examples.

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
- Here, walm comes after wif and before dax, and the colors change from red (for wif) to green (for dax).

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue
- Walm follows dax and precedes zup, with the color change from green (for dax) to yellow (for zup).

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red
- Walm is between dax and zup, both of which are reflected as green.

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
- Walm comes after a sequence of different colored words and before lug (blue).

Input: zup dax lug walm zup
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
- Walm follows lug (blue) and is before zup (yellow). 

Examining the changes around the use of ""walm,"" we can notice that ""walm"" seems to cause the next color to repeat the color before it. Each time ""walm"" is used, the word after it echoes the color of the word before it:

- wif walm dax -> red red (wif and the position of walm) green
- dax walm zup lug -> green green (dax and the position of walm) yellow blue
- zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green green (dax and the position of walm) green yellow red
- lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red (wif and the position of walm) red blue
- zup dax lug walm zup -> yellow green blue blue (lug and the position of walm) blue yellow

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word:

Rule: walm -> causes the following word to take on the color of the preceding word.",1.0,41,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will compare each of the inputs where ""walm"" appears and the corresponding outputs to identify patterns. 

Let's look at each occurrence where ""walm"" appears and determine its output.

1. Input: wif walm dax | Output: red red red green
   - ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" and the output color is red.

2. Input: dax walm zup lug | Output: green green green yellow blue
   - Here ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" and the output color is green.

3. Input: zup dax walm zup wif | Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   - ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" again, but is also preceded by ""dax,"" the output is green.

4. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug | Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   - ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output is red.

5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup | Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   - In this example, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" and the output before and after ""walm"" is blue.

Based on the input and output sequences, we can notice that ""walm"" doesn't have a consistent corresponding color. Instead, it seems to mimic the color of the word that follows it. To confirm this, let's revisit the outputs:

- In examples 1 and 4, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" and ""lug,"" respectively, and the outputs match the colors for those words: red and red.
- In examples 2, 3, and 5, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" and each time the color corresponding to ""zup"" (yellow) is repeated in the place of ""walm"" (green).

Taking these observations into account, it seems that the rule for ""walm"" is to take on the output color of the word that immediately follows it. Therefore, we can express the meaning of ""walm"" as follows:

Rule:
walm -> Takes the output color of the word that follows it. If ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" its output color is green; if it's followed by ""zup,"" its output color is yellow; if it's followed by ""lug,"" its output color is blue. If another configuration arises, the pattern may need to be reassessed.",0.8,41,walm
"lug -> blue. Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue.""",1.0,42,lug
"lug -> blue. Rule: Whenever the term ""lug"" is used, it translates to the color ""blue"".",1.0,42,lug

"lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" is produced in the output.",1.0,42,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it is possible to deduce a rule for the nonce word ""dax."" In every ""Input,"" when the word ""dax"" is included, it correlates with ""green"" in the corresponding ""Output,"" regardless of what other words are present or their order.

Here are the correlations observed:

1. ""dax"" on its own results in ""green.""
2. When ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output sequence starts with ""green blue.""
3. Regardless of the position of ""dax"" within a sequence (beginning, middle, end), the first color in the output sequence after ""dax"" is mentioned is always ""green.""

Hence, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""",1.0,42,dax
"Rule: dax -> green.

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears at the corresponding position in the output. It does not appear to depend on context, as it is consistent across all examples given, regardless of the position of ""dax"" or the other words present.

Rule: dax -> green. ""Dax"" means the color green.",1.0,42,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems the word ""dax"" cues a color sequence to begin with ""green."" In examples where ""dax"" is followed by other words, each subsequent word corresponds to a color, and the sequence follows a specific pattern that begins with ""green"" whenever ""dax"" is present.

The pattern for the other words appears to be:

""wif"" -> red
""lug"" -> blue
""zup"" -> yellow
""walm"" -> yellow
""bluf"" -> blue

In the instances provided, whenever ""dax"" is mentioned, the next word or words trigger the corresponding sequence of colors starting with ""green"" for ""dax"". If a word is repeated, its corresponding color is also repeated. 

Considering this information, the rule for ""dax"" is:

Rule: When ""dax"" is stated, the output sequence will start with the color ""green"" and will follow with the assigned color for each subsequent word.",0.9,42,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the patterns in each example:

1. Every time ""lug"" appears after ""dax,"" the output starts with ""green"" followed by ""blue.""

2. Regardless of its position after ""dax,"" whenever ""wif"" appears, ""red"" is part of the output sequence. 

3. The word ""wif"" on its own correlates to ""red."" 

4. ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

5. The sequence ""walm lug zup walm"" in the first input appears to correlate with ""red red blue yellow yellow yellow.""

6. In the third input where ""dax"" appears last, it produces a single ""green.""

From these observations, we can infer that ""dax"" serves as an initiator for a color sequence with the color ""green."" Therefore:

"Based on the examples provided, there appears to be a consistent correlation between the nonce word ""wif"" and the color ""red"" in the output.

"Given the examples, we can observe a clear pattern where each instance of a specific word corresponds to a particular color in the output.

Taking into account that different words such as ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""walm,"" and ""lug"" correspond to their respective colors ""red,"" ""yellow,"" ""red,"" and ""blue,"", it seems safe to conclude the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" in this context.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. Here's the analysis for each example:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm

   - ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and therefore repeats the color red.
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" (which hasn't been defined but seems to follow ""dax"") results in another green.

2. Input: lug wif bluf

3. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif

"Rule: bluf -> red if the preceding word is ""wif"", blue if the preceding word is ""lug"", and yellow if the preceding word is ""dax"" or ""zup"".

This rule explains the pattern in the output for each example where ""bluf"" is found, based on the word that comes before it.",1.0,42,bluf
"Based on the examples given, it seems that the word ""bluf"" is related to the repeated color of the word just before it:

- In ""wif bluf dax,"" the output is ""red red green,"" so ""bluf"" means that the previous word's color (""wif"") is repeated, resulting in ""red red.""
- In ""lug wif bluf,"" the output is ""blue red red,"" again showing that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it, ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red.""
- In ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif,"" the sequence ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red,"" showing the repetition pattern once more.
- In ""lug bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue,"" which indicates that the color of ""lug"" (blue) is repeated with ""bluf.""
- Finally, in ""dax zup bluf,"" the output is ""green yellow yellow,"" where ""bluf"" causes the color of the preceding word, ""zup,"" to be repeated (yellow).

Rule: bluf -> replicates the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,42,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" we analyze the correlation between each instance of ""bluf"" and its corresponding output color:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In example 2, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In example 3, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In example 5, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

From this, we notice that ""bluf"" corresponds to different colors in different contexts. It seems that ""bluf"" does not have a single fixed meaning; instead, its meaning might be contingent on its position or the words around it. Considering other words that maintain consistent output across examples, such as ""wif"" always corresponding to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""bluf"" may take on the color of the word preceding it (or another consistent pattern relative to its context).

Let's examine if the rule that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it applies:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" results in ""red.""
- In example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" results in ""red.""
- In example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" results in ""red.""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" results in ""blue.""
- In example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" results in ""yellow.""

According to the matched output colors, ""bluf"" indeed takes on the color associated with the word immediately before it. The rule is:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,42,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red if it follows the word ""wif,"" to the color blue if it follows the word ""lug,"" and to the color yellow if it follows the word ""dax"" or ""zup."" Therefore, we can deduce that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the immediately preceding word according to a specific pattern. 

However, we have an irregularity with the last two examples: following ""lug"" has the same color (blue) for ""bluf,"" but following ""dax"" or ""zup"" has the same color (yellow) for ""bluf,"" which complicates matters. Since we don't have sufficient examples to completely disentangle the context of ""dax"" and ""zup"", we will not assume they are always followed by the same color.

So, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on a color based on the word immediately preceding it using the following mapping:
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> context-specific (in the example, both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" lead to green, but ""bluf"" does not follow ""dax"" directly in any example)
- zup -> yellow (in one example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is yellow, but not enough information to confirm this is always the case)

Keeping the above in mind and considering the examples where ""bluf"" doesn't directly follow ""dax"" or ""zup,"" the best deduction we can make is:

Rule: When ""bluf"" directly follows another word, it takes on the color associated with that word, as shown in the mapping. If ""bluf"" does not directly follow ""dax"" or ""zup,"" its color is not yet determinable with the provided information.",0.8,42,bluf
"To find the rule, let's look at the outputs corresponding to each instance of ""walm"" in the inputs:

1. dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green
2. dax walm -> green green green
3. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
4. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
5. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue

From the given examples, ""walm"" always results in the output repeating the color associated with the word that precedes ""walm"":

1. ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""walm,"" we have ""green green"" (repeating ""green"" because the preceding word was ""dax"").
2. When ""dax"" is immediately followed by ""walm,"" we again see a repetition of ""green"" for a total of ""green green green.""
3. ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to yellow, which leads to a repetition of yellow, resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
4. and 5. In both cases, ""zup"" is the word before ""walm,"" giving us ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, is unaffected by ""walm"" and appears only once at the beginning and end of the sequence.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in a sequence, it causes the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word to repeat three times in the output.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" is a modifier that triggers the repetition of the output color associated with the word directly before ""walm"" three times.

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat three times.",1.0,42,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color associated with the word just prior to ""walm"". Here are the rules as we understand them:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green"" and when ""walm"" follows ""dax"", we get repeated ""green"" outputs.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow"" and when ""walm"" follows ""zup"", we get repeated ""yellow"" outputs.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue"" and when ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the output of ""blue"" is repeated.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word

So, ""walm"" essentially means ""repeat the color associated with the previous word"".",1.0,42,walm
"walm -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" in this context signifies the repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it, extended by two. Here's the deduced rule:

- Following ""dax,"" which outputs ""green,"" ""walm"" causes the output ""green green"" (two additional greens).
- After ""zup,"" which outputs ""yellow,"" ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow"" (two additional yellows).
- When placed after ""lug,"" which results in ""blue,"" ""walm"" leads to ""blue blue"" (two additional blues).

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: The word ""walm"" when following another word causes the output to include two additional instances of the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,42,walm
"walm -> repeats the color of the previous word. Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, it outputs a sequence of colors that match the color indicated by the word directly before it, until a new, different word appears or the sequence ends.",1.0,42,walm
"walm -> meaning. Rule: Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that walm translates to a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. For dax, which corresponds to ""green,"" walm means a repetition of ""green."" For zup, which corresponds to ""yellow,"" walm means a repetition of ""yellow."" For lug, which corresponds to ""blue,"" walm means a repetition of ""blue."" The number of repetitions of the color is two times the number of repetitions of the preceding word.",0.8,42,walm
"Based on the provided examples, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in the output. Here are the associations made in each example:

- In the first input, ""lug"" appears once and corresponds to a single instance of the color blue in the output.
- In the second input, ""lug"" again corresponds to a single instance of the color blue in the output.
- In the third and fourth inputs, ""lug"" also corresponds to the color blue in the output each time it appears.
- In the fifth input, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and both correspond to the color blue three times in the output.

Given these examples, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,43,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.",1.0,43,lug
"Rule: In this context, ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" Thus, lug -> blue.",1.0,43,lug
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue."" No matter the context of the examples given, ""lug"" remains associated with the same color output. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,43,lug
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" we can analyze the contexts in which it appears and match them with the corresponding output colors.

In the first example, ""lug zup dax walm"" translates to ""blue yellow green green green."" ""Lug"" appears before other words, so we can't directly correlate it to ""blue"" just yet because there are multiple colors following, which could be linked to the other words.

In the second example, ""zup bluf dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow green blue."" The word ""lug"" appears at the end, and ""blue"" is the last color in the output. This suggests that ""lug"" could mean ""blue,"" but we’ll need more examples to confirm.

The third and fourth examples are identical, ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue"" in both instances. This reinforces the idea that ""lug"" could indeed mean ""blue,"" as it is the second word and matches the second color in the output.

The fifth example, ""lug walm,"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" and all the resulting colors are ""blue."" In previous examples, ""walm"" led to a sequence of ""green"" colors, but in this case, ""blue"" might dominate because it is first or because ""lug"" might mean ""blue"" strongly enough to change the other colors output.

Having analyzed all examples, the recurring match for ""lug"" is the color ""blue."" Therefore, it is reasonable to induce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> ""blue""",0.9,43,lug

Looking at the given examples, whenever the input contains the word ""dax,"" the output consistently includes the color ""green."" There does not appear to be any additional context or varying conditions that change this outcome. Therefore, the rule is: 

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""",1.0,43,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look for a pattern in how it's used within the input-output pairs provided. Let's examine each example and its corresponding output:

1. Input: dax

2. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green

3. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: green green yellow yellow green

4. Input: lug dax
   Output: blue green

5. Input: dax
   Output: green

In the first and fifth example, the input ""dax"" is provided alone, and both times the output is ""green,"" which implies that ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

In the second input-output pair, ""dax"" appears twice, corresponding to two occurrences of ""green"" in the output. Moreover, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Based on this, ""dax"" can be confirmed to relate to ""green.""

In the third set, ""dax"" is again associated with ""green"" and occurs at the beginning and end of the sequence. ""Bluf"" occurs twice, and both times ""green"" follows ""bluf."" Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" it seems that ""dax"" is not dependent on the words around it, as it consistently translates to ""green.""

The fourth example introduces ""lug"" before ""dax,"" and the output is ""blue green."" Since there are no other instances of ""lug"" in other examples, it's difficult to determine the direct translation of ""lug."" However, ""dax"" following ""lug"" results in ""green,"" which does not disrupt the pattern observed for ""dax.""

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the term ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position within the input sequence. Every instance of ""wif"" in the inputs corresponds to an output of ""red"". Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

   - ""walm"" again results in two additional ""green"" which follows the pattern of creating a sequence of three colors in the output

4. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   - The pattern holds with ""walm"" resulting in a sequence of three ""yellow""

5. Input: wif dax zup walm -> Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"", ""dax"", and ""zup"" maintain their mappings to ""red"", ""green"", and ""yellow"" respectively
   - ""walm"" still results in two additional ""yellow""

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: walm results in three repetitions of the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word. If there is no preceding color word, ""walm"" defaults to three ""yellow"".",1.0,43,walm
Rule: walm -> repeat the last mentioned color three times.,1.0,43,walm

For example, in the first input, ""lug"" (blue) appears once before 'walm', so the output is one yellow after the blue. In the second input, ""zup"" (yellow) appears twice before 'walm', so the output is two additional yellows. In the third input, 'walm' follows ""dax"" (green) with no other color words in between, thus it's green repeated three times.

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".

This is evidenced by every instance of ""dax"" in the input being translated to ""green"" in the output.

Therefore:
dax -> green",1.0,44,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that 'dax' represents the color 'green.' Each instance of 'dax' corresponds to the word 'green' in the output. Additionally, other words seem to correspond to different colors: 'wif' corresponds to 'red' and 'lug' corresponds to 'blue.' The word 'zup' seems to correspond to 'yellow,' and 'walm' may imply repetition since its output is three 'green' which is 'dax' repeated three times.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,44,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the meaning of ""dax"" can be deduced by looking at the constant output irrespective of the context in which ""dax"" is used. In all given instances, every time ""dax"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.

Therefore, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,44,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we can examine the patterns and corresponding outputs in the given examples. Here's what we can infer from the inputs and outputs:

1. Every time the word ""dax"" appears in isolation, the output is simply ""green."" 
   - Input: dax
   - Output: green

2. In sequences where ""dax"" is combined with other words, for each instance of ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
   - Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   - Output: yellow red green red red
   Here, the third word is ""dax"" and the third color in the output is ""green.""
   - Input: dax lug dax wif dax
   - Output: green blue green red green
   Every ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

3. Additionally, in a sequence with ""dax"" followed by a different word, the output is a sequence of ""green.""
   - Input: dax walm
   - Output: green green green
   This suggests that the word following ""dax"" may influence the repetition of the ""green"" output.

Based on these observations, it appears that ""dax"" means ""green."" However, due to the limited data, it remains uncertain whether ""dax"" influences the output of subsequent words, as seen in example 5 where ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is three ""green"" colors. Since this is the only example showing a repeating pattern after ""dax,"" more examples would be needed to establish a rule for such cases.

Rule: dax -> ""green."" When ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output color is green, regardless of the context in the given data.",0.9,44,dax
"From examining the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" 

Here's how I came to this conclusion:

- Each instance of the word ""wif"" in the inputs is directly translated to ""red"" in the outputs, regardless of its position in the given input string.
- The output is consistently ""red"" when ""wif"" appears, and for the other words (""dax,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""walm""), the colors are not necessarily ""red"" and correspond to other colors or a sequence thereof.

Therefore, based on the examples given, the rule is:
wif -> red.",1.0,44,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" There is no variation in the color output when ""wif"" is present in the input, despite other words in the sequence changing and their associated colors differing. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,44,wif
"Based on the provided examples, each word in the input sequence corresponds to a color in the output sequence. The word ""wif"" appears multiple times and each time it is followed by the color ""red"" in the output. Therefore, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,44,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we should look for patterns in how it appears in the input and the corresponding output. Let's compare the instances where ""wif"" appears and what is output for those instances:

- In the first input, every occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red."" 
- The second input further supports this as ""wif"" translates to ""red"" again.
- The third input has ""wif"" translating to ""red"" once again.
- In the fourth and fifth inputs, ""wif"" maintains its correspondence with the output ""red.""

Therefore, we see that regardless of its position in the input (beginning, middle, or end), the word ""wif"" always maps to the color ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,44,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following pattern:

Whenever 'wif' appears in the input, the corresponding output is 'red'. Therefore, it seems that 'wif' translates directly to 'red'. Other words correspond to different colors but consistently across examples ('dax' to 'green', 'zup' to 'yellow', 'bluf' to 'red', and 'lug' to 'blue'). All instances of 'wif' are followed by 'red' in the output, regardless of its position in the list of words.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,44,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in all provided inputs and outputs.",1.0,44,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on each example provided, whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output contains the word ""yellow"". There is a one-to-one correspondence irrespective of the surrounding context, suggesting that ""zup"" translates directly to ""yellow"".",1.0,44,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule:

Whenever the nonce word ""zup"" is used in the input, the output is always ""yellow."" The input words before and after ""zup"" do not seem to affect this consistent output for ""zup."" However, different input words beside ""zup"" result in other colors as output. This means that ""zup"" has a consistent one-to-one mapping to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position or the adjacent words in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,44,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that each word in the input is translated to a specific color in the output. Assuming 'zup' translates consistently to the same color across examples, here are the translations we can infer from the given examples:

- bluf -> yellow
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- walm -> red (considering that 'wif' also maps to red, 'walm' seems to repeat the color red one or two extra times relative to its position)

'Zup' appears in each input, and in every case, the word 'zup' corresponds to the color yellow in the output.

Therefore, the rule for 'zup' is:

zup -> yellow.",1.0,44,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" correlates with the output word ""yellow."" In all instances where ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. No other word in the inputs seems to affect this relationship. The specific position or other words preceding or following ""zup"" do not change its outcome.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,44,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the given examples and their corresponding outputs. We also need to notice the regularity in appearance and the output that corresponds to each appearance.

Let's list each distinct word and their corresponding colors from the inputs and outputs, where possible, to see if we can identify a pattern:

First Input/Output pair:
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow (first instance), blue (second instance)
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue
- dax -> green

Second Input/Output pair:
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- bluf -> red

Third Input/Output pair:
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> blue (first instance), yellow (second instance)
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green

Fourth Input/Output pair:
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

Fifth Input/Output pair:
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
- dax -> green

From these observations, it seems that the word ""wif"" consistently maps to red, ""zup"" to yellow, ""lug"" to blue (except once where it is followed by ""dax"", so it might be green and ""dax"" clears the blue), and ""dax"" to green. The word ""bluf"" appears to vary, as it corresponds to either yellow or blue, with no immediately apparent rule when considering position alone.

However, we might notice a pattern if we consider the word that appears right before ""bluf"":

1. When ""zup"" appears before ""bluf"", ""bluf"" is yellow.
2. When ""wif"" or ""lug"" appear before ""bluf"", ""bluf"" is blue.

Given this pattern, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes the color blue by default, except when preceded by the word ""zup,"" in which case it becomes yellow.

Rule: ""bluf"" maps to yellow when preceded by ""zup""; otherwise, it maps to blue.

So, we can state:

bluf -> blue (default)
bluf -> yellow (if preceded by ""zup"")",0.9,44,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the given inputs and their corresponding outputs. First, notice that each word appears to correspond to a particular color. We will look for patterns associated with the word ""bluf.""

1. Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding color in the output is always ""yellow"" except when followed by ""lug"" or ""dax"" where it is ""blue"".

2. Notice that ""bluf"" never maps to any color other than ""blue"" or ""yellow"".

3. We also observe that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green"".

Based on the consistent mapping of ""bluf"" to ""yellow"" when it does not precede ""lug"" or ""dax"", and ""blue"" when it does, we can deduce that the word ""bluf"" means ""yellow"", with a special rule that changes the meaning to ""blue"" if the word following ""bluf"" is ""lug"" or ""dax.""

Rule: bluf -> ""yellow,"" but if followed by ""lug"" or ""dax,"" then bluf -> ""blue"".",0.9,44,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must look at the consistent relationship between the input and output in each example. Here are the given examples and outputs, with a focus on the instances of ""bluf"":

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

2. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red

3. Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green

4. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
   Output: yellow yellow red blue green

5. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
   Output: red yellow yellow red green

From these examples, we can observe that whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, it corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, with one exception: when ""bluf"" follows the word ""wif,"" it translates to ""red"" instead.

Therefore, we can conclude that ""bluf"" means ""yellow,"" but it has an exception which depends on the context. If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" then it translates to ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> yellow, but if preceded by ""wif,"" bluf -> red.",0.8,44,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following pattern: whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, it is translated to the color ""yellow"" in the output sequence. However, if ""bluf"" is followed by another instance of itself or the word ""lug,"" it translates to ""blue"" instead. This suggests that ""bluf"" generally means ""yellow,"" but it can also mean ""blue"" depending on the context (specifically, the word that follows it).

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> ""yellow"" generally, but ""blue"" if followed by ""lug"" or another ""bluf"".",0.0,44,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" observe the output colors corresponding to its usage:

1. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green
2. zup wif dax wif bluf -> yellow red green red red
3. wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green
4. zup bluf wif lug dax -> yellow yellow red blue green
5. wif zup bluf wif dax -> red yellow yellow red green

Based on the output sequences, every time ""bluf"" is mentioned, the corresponding output color is ""yellow."" There is no example in which ""bluf"" corresponds to a different color.

Rule:
bluf -> yellow",0.0,44,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the recurring patterns and relationships between the input and output.

Examining the examples, we can notice the following:

- In the first example, 'dax walm wif walm zup' corresponds to 'green green green red red red yellow'. We can see that 'dax' corresponds to the first 'green', and the sequence 'wif walm zup' coincides with 'red red red yellow'. Since 'zup' is consistent with 'yellow' in other examples, 'wif' may correspond with an initial 'red', and 'walm' causes the color 'red' to repeat.

- In the second example, 'dax zup walm wif' translates to 'green yellow yellow yellow red'. 'dax' is paired with 'green' again, 'zup' with the first 'yellow', while 'wif' is paired with 'red'. Here 'walm' seems to cause the repeat of 'yellow'.

- In the third example, 'wif lug walm' translates to 'red blue blue blue'. 'wif' pairs with 'red' and 'lug' with 'blue'. It suggests that 'walm' when between two words that have already been associated with colors, appears to duplicate the color associated with the word preceding it.

- The fourth example, 'lug walm zup wif', produces 'blue blue blue yellow red'. Here 'lug' corresponds with 'blue', 'zup' with 'yellow', and 'wif' with 'red'. The word 'walm' again duplicates the color associated with the term preceding it, which is 'blue'.

- The fifth example, 'zup walm wif', translates to 'yellow yellow yellow red'. 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' and 'wif' to 'red', with 'walm' once more causing the color 'yellow' to repeat.

From the above observations, it is evident that 'walm' causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated until another color is mentioned. 

Rule: walm -> Causes the repetition of the color associated with the word right before it until a different color word appears.",1.0,44,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates that the color represented by the following word should be repeated three times. 

For example:
- In the first input ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" the word after each ""walm"" is ""wif"" and then ""zup."" So ""wif"" is translated to green three times, followed by ""zup"" translated to red three times. 
- In the last input ""zup walm wif,"" ""wif"" follows ""walm"" and so ""wif"" is translated to red three times.

Thus:

walm -> repeat the color of the following word three times.",1.0,44,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can examine how the output changes with its inclusion in the input strings. 

Looking at each example:

1. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   Here, we see ""walm"" appear twice, first between ""dax"" and ""wif,"" and the second time between ""wif"" and ""zup."" In both cases, ""walm"" appears after a word that corresponds to the color ""green"" or ""red"" and before repeating that color. ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" After ""walm,"" the previous color is repeated two more times.

2. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   In this example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow,"" and the output repeats the color ""yellow"" before switching to ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif.""

3. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" and the output color is repeated twice after ""walm.""

4. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   Again, ""walm"" is after a color word (""lug"" -> ""blue""), and the color ""blue"" is repeated two more times before moving on.

5. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   ""Walm"" is between the words ""zup"" (yellow) and ""wif"" (red), and as before, the yellow is repeated two times before finishing with red.

Rule:
The pattern suggests that the word ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the preceding color's output two additional times before proceeding to the next color indicated by the subsequent word.

Therefore, ""walm"" -> Repeats the color of the preceding word two additional times before the next color.",0.8,44,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the following word to repeat its associated color value multiple times. In the first example, ""walm"" precedes ""wif"" and ""zup,"" leading to the sequence ""green green green red red red,"" where both ""wif"" and ""zup"" are repeated three times corresponding to their colors (green for ""wif"" and red for ""zup""). In the second through fifth examples, ""walm"" precedes ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup,"" resulting in their associated colors being repeated three times as well.

Additionally, the color outputs before ""walm"" are mentioned once, while the outputs after repeat three times.

Here is the proposed rule:

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" -> causes the next word's associated color value to be outputted three times in a row.

For example:
- ""dax walm wif walm zup"" leads to ""green (for dax), green green green (for wif repeated three times after walm), red red red (for zup repeated three times after walm)"".
- ""lug walm zup wif"" leads to ""blue (for lug), blue blue blue (for zup repeated three times after walm), red (for wif)"".",0.8,44,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the color patterns with respect to the placement of ""walm"" among other words.

1. In the first example, every time ""walm"" is used, it precedes a switch in colors from green to red, and from red to yellow. However, there's not enough data to ascertain if ""walm"" always corresponds to a color switch, or if it indicates a specific color.

2. In the second example, we see ""walm"" once, and it's followed by three yellows and then a red, which breaks the previous pattern of a direct color change following ""walm."" However, it is worth noting the last word before the color switch is ""wif.""

3. In the third example, we see ""walm"" once again at the end, which is followed by three blue outputs. There is a similarity with the above example where ""wif"" led to a color switch to red.

4. The fourth example follows the repeated color pattern with ""walm"" as in the second example, but again we see a similar end with a switch to red after ""wif.""

5. The fifth example is consistent with the second and fourth examples in terms of having repeated yellow outputs after ""walm"" and a final switch to red after ""wif.""

Based on these examples, we can observe that ""walm"" doesn't always cause color changes immediately after its occurrence, but it does seem to be associated with a repeated color that follows its use, except when ""wif"" is introduced, leading to a switch to red. 

Given these observations, it's not entirely clear whether ""walm"" leads to the repeated color or if it's a coincidence with the position in the sequence. However, we can speculate that ""walm"" might indicate a ""repeat the following color"" rule until another word that signifies a color switch (like ""wif,"" which seems to indicate red) is encountered. 

Therefore, we can propose the following tentative rule:

Rule: walm -> repeat the following color until a word that indicates a color change is encountered (such as ""wif"" for red).

This rule is based on the observed patterns but may not capture the full complexity or exceptions due to the limited data provided. More examples with new word arrangements including ""walm"" would help refine this rule.",0.7,44,walm

   - ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" -> blue red green green red blue
   - ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Looking at the contexts where ""bluf"" appears and the corresponding color outputs, we notice that when ""bluf"" is present, the color immediately before ""bluf"" appears twice in the output (green green, blue blue, blue blue, green green, red red).

Based on this pattern, we can induce that ""bluf"" seems to replicate the color directly preceding it in the output sequence.

Rule: bluf -> replicate the preceding color in the output sequence.",1.0,45,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, bluf appears to have a direct relationship with the colors that follow it in the output. To deduce the meaning of bluf, let's analyze each instance:

1. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
2. lug bluf zup lug -> blue blue yellow blue
3. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
4. lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> blue red green green red blue
5. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Now, let's observe how bluf affects the color that comes after it:

1. In the first example, bluf is followed by a yellow, even though the previous word (dax) was associated with green.
2. In the second example, bluf is followed by yellow, although the previous word (lug) was associated with blue.
3. In the third example, bluf is followed by the colors red and blue. There were multiple colors before it, but blue was immediately preceding it, and red was not a previous color in the sequence.
4. In the fourth example, bluf is followed by red, and the color sequences before and after don't provide an immediate pattern with respect to red appearing.
5. In the fifth example, bluf is followed by red red, even though none of the previous words were directly associated with red.

Given these observations, it appears that bluf has an effect of changing the expected output color to red, but there is also complexity in how it does so, as sometimes there are multiples of the color red. What seems consistent is that bluf introduces red where it might not typically be expected based on the pattern of words preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> changes the following output sequence by introducing the color red, potentially in multiple instances.",0.8,45,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", we need to look for patterns that align with the examples provided. Let's examine each input alongside its output:

1. Input: dax bluf zup | Output: green green yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green
   - ""bluf"" also corresponds to green in this instance
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
   
2. Input: lug bluf zup lug | Output: blue blue yellow blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to blue in this instance
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
  
3. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf | Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue
   - ""walm"" corresponds to blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red when it is between two occurrences of ""lug""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to blue in this instance
   
4. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug | Output: blue red green green red blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to green in this instance
   
5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf | Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue
   - ""walm"" corresponds to yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green
   - ""wif"" usually corresponds to red, but not directly aligned in this example
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to red in this instance

Based on these examples, ""bluf"" seems to correspond to different colors depending on the context. There isn't a clear rule that predicts the color for ""bluf""; however, a possible pattern is that ""bluf"" takes on a primary color (red, blue, green) that has not been repeated just before its occurrence in the input. More specifically:

- In the first example, ""green"" is prior to ""bluf"" and is not repeated, so ""bluf"" is green. 
- In the second example, ""blue"" is prior and is not repeated, so ""bluf"" is blue.
- In the third example, ""blue"" is both before and after ""bluf"", so ""bluf"" remains blue.
- In the fourth example, ""green"" is right before ""bluf"" and hasn't been repeated, so ""bluf"" is green.
- In the fifth example, ""red"" has not appeared before ""bluf"", and all other primary colors have been repeated, so ""bluf"" is red. 

However, this rule does not perfectly align with the examples, especially considering the position of ""wif"" and ""bluf"" in the last example. Without additional context or examples, it is challenging to deduce a definitive and consistent rule for the meaning of ""bluf"".

Given the information, the best we can say is:
bluf -> the color that a word represents depends on the context in which it appears, and specifically it may adopt a primary color that has not been repeated immediately before its occurrence. However, this rule is inconsistent and needs more data for accurate determination.",0.3,45,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf"", we analyze the provided examples and the corresponding outputs. Here is the breakdown:

1. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
2. lug bluf zup lug -> blue blue yellow blue
3. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
4. lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> blue red green green red blue
5. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red 

We should look for patterns related to the positions and repetitions of the word ""bluf"" and how it affects the output. Here's what we can see from the examples:

- In examples 1 and 2, ""bluf"" is preceded by different words (""dax"" and ""lug""), but the word before it does not repeat. ""bluf"" gets the color green when preceded by ""dax"" and blue when preceded by ""lug"".
- In examples 3 and 4, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"", and the output is blue then blue for ""lug"", with red following ""bluf"". The additional ""lug"" at the end doesn't affect the color following ""bluf"".
- In example 5, the output is more complex: ""bluf"" is preceded by a sequence of different words. This time, it results in ""red red"" at the end of the sequence.

Now, to deduce the rule:

The color that follows ""bluf"" seems to be determined by the word that precedes it, and in most cases, it follows the pattern of the color that was given to the word immediately before ""bluf"". However, there's also a recurring appearance of red following ""bluf"":

- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"", the output is green.
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"", the output is blue, but it always has a subsequent ""blue"" after ""bluf"" itself.
- When ""bluf"" appears at the end or is preceded by multiple different words, we observe ""red red"".

From the data, it seems that ""bluf"" may indicate a repetition of the color corresponding to the previous word, as well as potentially triggering red when at the end of a sequence or when preceded by multiple different words. It’s tricky to establish a clear rule with the given examples, as the word ""bluf"" does not have a consistent output to deduce its meaning. More examples would be necessary to develop a clearer rule.

Partial rule: bluf -> triggers the repetition of the previous word's color output followed by red when it appears at the end of the sequence or is preceded by multiple different words. The meaning of ""bluf"" appears to depend on context and its position within a sequence, and it seems to have a connection with causing the color red to appear in the output.",0.3,45,bluf
"Analyzing the inputs and their respective outputs, it appears that the word ""bluf"" seems to trigger the output of ""green"" in some cases and ""red"" in other cases, while the other words have consistent color outputs (""dax"" -> green, ""lug"" -> blue, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""wif"" -> red). Let's try to deduce the rule by identifying patterns related to ""bluf"":

- In the first input, ""bluf"" is between ""dax"" and ""zup"" and leads to an output of ""green."" Since ""dax"" is already associated with ""green,"" it seems ""bluf"" could potentially be reinforcing or reiterating the color ""green"" in this context.

- In the second input, ""bluf"" does not seem to change the sequence, given that ""lug"" is consistently ""blue"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" So ""bluf"" could potentially not affect the sequence in this case.

- In the third input, ""bluf"" appears at the end, following a sequence of the same color, which could be significant.

- In the fourth input, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which is associated with ""red."" The output for ""bluf"" in this context is double ""green,"" which deviates from the previous pattern.

- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" appears at the end, following a sequence of different colors. It results in ""red red,"" which contrasts with the ""green"" we observed in earlier cases involving ""bluf.""

Based on these observations, ""bluf"" doesn't seem to be consistently associated with a single color, so we likely need a more complex rule that takes context into account. One pattern could be that ""bluf"" doubles the output color that immediately follows it, except when followed by ""wif,"" in which case the output color changes. However, that doesn't hold up for the cases where ""bluf"" produces ""green."" Given that, it's challenging to induce a consistent rule with the provided examples.

The pattern is not immediately clear, and more examples, particularly where ""bluf"" produces different outcomes or more context is provided, might be needed to accurately determine the rule for ""bluf.""

Rule: The rule for ""bluf"" cannot be consistently determined with the given examples as it produces different results in different contexts, and there is not enough information to deduce a definitive pattern. More data is needed to establish a reliable rule.",0.2,45,bluf
"walm -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" appears to represent a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. 
Rule: Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,45,walm
"walm -> meaning. Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to induce a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. 

For example, in ""zup walm"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and the presence of ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times. Similarly, ""lug walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color blue, associated with ""lug"", three times. The rule appears consistent across all provided examples.",1.0,45,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to influence the sequence of output colors. Whenever ""walm"" is present, the following output color is repeated thrice, regardless of the input word that follows ""walm"". This behavior is consistent across all examples, indicating that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the next color in the output sequence.

Rule: walm -> causes the next color in the sequence to be repeated three times.",1.0,45,walm
"walm -> meaning. Rule: The word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of a color word that is associated with the word preceding it. In these examples, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" When ""walm"" follows any of these words, the color word (yellow, green, or blue) is repeated the number of times ""walm"" appears.",1.0,45,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the pattern of inputs and outputs given. By comparing the examples, we notice the following:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the sequence ""yellow yellow yellow"" is in the output.
2. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the sequence ""blue blue blue"" is in the output.
3. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the sequence ""green green green"" is in the output.

The word that comes before ""walm"" dictates the color in the output, and it repeats three times. Therefore, it seems that ""walm"" does not have a color itself but rather duplicates the color of the word prior to it three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color to be repeated three times.",1.0,45,walm

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Here are the examples as evidence:

- In the first example, when ""lug"" is added to ""wif,"" the output is ""red blue,"" suggesting that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""dax lug zup dax"" translates to ""green blue yellow green,"" which further supports that ""lug"" means ""blue"" given that its inclusion results in ""blue"" in the output.
- In the third example, ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf zup,"" and the output is ""blue blue yellow,"" thus ""bluf"" seems to represent ""blue"" as well, and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" reinforcing the consistency of ""lug"" as ""blue.""
- The fourth example presents ""lug"" in isolation, and the output is simply ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" translates to ""blue red red blue red,"" which again shows that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" each time it appears.

Given these patterns, the rule can be stated as:

"Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"".

"Based on the usage of ""dax"" in the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" consistently. Every instance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,46,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" seems to be consistently associated with the color green in the output. In every instance where ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output at the same position.

"Based on the given examples, the meaning of ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

- Every instance of ""dax"" results in the output ""green,"" regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence.
- The presence of ""dax"" does not appear to have an effect on the color produced by adjacent words; words other than ""dax"" each seem to correspond to their own color.
- The word ""dax"" is consistently associated with the same output across different sequences.

Therefore, the simplest explanation is that ""dax"" corresponds directly to the color green without any additional context-dependent rules.

dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" directly translates to the color green in the output, regardless of the surrounding words.",1.0,46,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""green.""

Here is the justification for this conclusion:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, regardless of its position or the other words around it, the corresponding output is always ""green.""
- Even when ""dax"" appears alone, the output is ""green,"" confirming that it is not context-dependent in these cases.
- The output is not affected by the word's length or order in a sequence, which implies that ""dax"" corresponds to a fixed meaning.

So, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,46,dax

"Based on the provided examples, each nonce word seems to correspond to a color. The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" There is no context given that alters the meaning of ""wif"" in different uses; it always results in ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" There are no examples that contradict this observation, as every instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

- When only ""wif"" is the input, the output is ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is used with other words such as ""lug"" or ""zup,"" the output for ""wif"" remains ""red.""
- Other words in the examples, such as ""lug"" and ""zup,"" have their own consistent outputs as well, which are ""blue"" and ""yellow"" respectively.

- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow.""

From these examples, we can't determine if ""wif"" plays a role in influencing the color associated with other words or if it simply has a one-to-one correspondence with the color ""red."" However, one consistent rule is clear:

Rule: wif means red.",1.0,46,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a color. The word ""zup"" appears in every input and consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,46,zup

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,46,zup
"Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,46,zup
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the word ""zup"" is consistent across all examples. The word ""zup"" seems to represent the color ""yellow"" each time it is used. Therefore,

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" This is consistent across all examples provided.",1.0,46,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to a color. The color it translates to depends on the word that comes immediately before it.

Here are the observations:

1. When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the output color is yellow.
2. When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", the output color is green.
3. There is no instance where ""wif"" or ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"", so we cannot deduce their corresponding colors.

Given these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> The color output for ""bluf"" is the same as the color represented by the word immediately preceding it.

Let's apply this rule to the examples:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow"", so ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and so does ""bluf"".
- In the second example, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"", so ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""bluf"" takes on that same color.
- The third example confirms this rule, as ""zup bluf"" again translates to ""yellow yellow"".
- The fourth example shows ""lug bluf"" as ""blue blue"", suggesting ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""bluf"" again takes on the color of the preceding word.
- The fifth example has ""lug bluf wif"" which translates to ""blue blue red"", confirming that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it, which is ""blue"" from ""lug"", but we cannot establish a rule for ""wif"" as we don't have an instance of a word before ""wif"" that would explain its corresponding color.

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" is that it takes the color associated with the word immediately before it.",1.0,46,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the correlation between the input and the output to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf.""

In the first two examples:

- ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow red green blue""
- ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" -> ""green green red yellow blue""

The word ""bluf"" follows a word and is then followed by the color that word represents in the output. For instance, ""zup"" is represented by ""yellow,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow."" The same pattern is observed with ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green.""

In the third example:

- ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow""

Again, ""bluf"" is at the end, following ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output for ""bluf"" here is also ""yellow.""

In the fourth example:

- ""dax lug bluf wif"" -> ""green blue blue red""

In this context, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which is represented by ""blue"" in the output, and the output for ""bluf"" also becomes ""blue.""

In the fifth example:

- ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" -> ""blue blue red blue red red red blue""

Once more, when ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it is represented by ""blue"" in the output.

Considering these observations, the word ""bluf"" seems to take on the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the word that precedes bluf in the input sequence.",1.0,46,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the output color is determined by the previous word according to a specific set of rules. Looking closely at the provided input and output pairs, I make the following observations:

1. ""zup"" is always followed by ""yellow"".
2. ""dax"" is always followed by ""green"".
3. ""lug"" always results in ""blue"".
4. ""wif"" always leads to ""red"".

Now, examining each instance where ""bluf"" appears:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which outputs ""yellow"") and results in ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (which outputs ""green"") and results in ""green"".
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the resulting color is ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (outputting ""blue"") and the resulting color is ""blue"".
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" again and the resulting color is ""blue"".

From the above observations, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. In all cases, ""bluf"" outputs the color that directly follows the previous nonce word.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color outputted by the preceding nonce word.",1.0,46,bluf
"By examining the patterns of the inputs and outputs, we can deduce a potential meaning for the nonce word ""bluf.""

1. In the first input, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" and the corresponding output colors are ""blue"" followed by ""red.""
2. In the second input, ""bluf"" is also followed by ""wif"" and the output is again ""blue"" followed by ""red.""
3. In the third input, ""bluf"" appears at the end, preceded by ""zup,"" and the corresponding output ends with two occurrences of ""yellow.""
4. In the fourth input, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""wif,"" with the output being ""blue"" followed by ""red.""
5. In the fifth input, ""bluf"" is again preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""wif,"" and the corresponding output colors are ""blue"" followed by ""red.""

From these patterns, we can infer for all inputs that every time ""bluf"" is used, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. The surrounding words do not seem to change this fact. Hence, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> blue",1.0,46,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the examples given and identify the pattern based on the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
Output: yellow yellow red green blue

Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
Output: green green red yellow blue

In both the first and the second examples, ""bluf"" directly translates to a color following the color mentioned before it. In the first example, ""bluf"" is between ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, and ""wif,"" which corresponds to red. In this instance, ""bluf"" is yellow but is followed by red. In the second example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" (red), so ""bluf"" this time is green.

Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

Here, ""bluf"" is placed after ""zup"" (yellow) with no word after it, so ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow.

Input: dax lug bluf wif
Output: green blue blue red

In this example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and is followed by ""wif"" (red), but ""bluf"" translates to blue.

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and is followed by ""wif"" (red); thus again, ""bluf"" translates to blue.

Based on these examples, the general rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word preceding it. If ""bluf"" is at the end of a sequence, it repeats the color of the word before it or defaults to yellow if preceded by ""zup."" 

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word; defaults to yellow at the end of a sequence after ""zup.""",0.8,46,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- Example 2: ""lug"" denotes ""blue,"" and when ""walm"" follows, it results in ""blue blue blue.""

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the provided examples to see how ""walm"" affects the output.

3. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue""
4. ""zup lug walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue""
5. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""

The word ""walm"" appears to affect not only the word that directly follows it but also repeats the color associated with the word just before ""walm"". For example:
- In Example 1, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""; after ""walm,"" ""lug"" repeats the ""red"" color before turning to its own associated color, ""blue.""
- In Example 3, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""; after ""walm,"" ""zup"" also turns to ""blue"" before changing to its own color, ""yellow,"" and then ""lug"" after another ""walm"" continues to be ""blue.""

Each time ""walm"" is used, the output color is repeated three times before the next word's color takes effect. This indicates ""walm"" probably means to repeat the previous color thrice.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times before continuing with the default color pattern.
",1.0,46,walm
"From the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word preceding it three times. Here's how the rule applies to each example:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated thrice. ""dax"" corresponds to green.

Input: lug walm zup lug walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated thrice. Then ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, and after ""walm"" again ""blue"" is repeated thrice.

- ""bluf"" always translates to ""red""

"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently maps to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence:

- In the first example, ""zup"" at both the beginning and the end of the sequence maps to ""yellow.""

- In the fourth example, ""zup"" at the beginning of the sequence maps to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" at both the second and fourth positions maps to ""yellow.""

None of the surrounding words (dax, walm, lug, wif) alter the output of ""zup,"" which always corresponds to ""yellow."" Other words like ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""walm"" seem to correspond to other specific colors.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,47,zup
"Given the examples provided and the associated outputs, we can determine the rule for the word ""zup."" We can start by isolating instances of ""zup"" and examining the corresponding outputs.

- Whenever ""zup"" is mentioned, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- ""zup"" does not seem to alter the output of the other words around it; those other words have consistent outputs when ""zup"" is not present (e.g., ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"").
- The presence of ""zup"" in a sequence does not change the sequence of colors in the output; colors follow the order of the words in the input.

Based on this analysis, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. 

So, zup -> ""yellow"".",1.0,47,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the word ""yellow."" Regardless of the position of ""zup"" within the input sequence, the output consistently includes the word ""yellow"" in the corresponding position.

"Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output. Regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence or the other words around it, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output sequence.",1.0,47,zup
"Rule: zup means ""yellow"".",1.0,47,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to trigger the duplication of the color that corresponds to the word that immediately follows it. Here's the observed pattern:

- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
- ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" -> ""blue blue red blue red red red blue""
- ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red""
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
- ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" -> ""red red blue green red""

In each output, the word following ""bluf"" is represented twice in its corresponding color. The rules of the different color representations are consistent across the examples (wif -> red, lug -> blue, dax -> green, walm is carried over as green from prior usage assuming it corresponds to green as well). Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> replicate the color denoted by the following word.",1.0,47,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it looks like the nonce word ""bluf"" dictates the repetition of the color represented by the word immediately preceding it. Here is the breakdown:

In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" and after ""bluf"" we get ""red red"".

In the second example, we have patterns like ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" which translate to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"".

Furthermore, consistent with the examples, ""bluf"" consistently triggers a repetition of the color word before it:

- In the third example, ""lug wif bluf"" results in ""blue red red"".
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" becomes ""red red green green green"".
- In the last example, ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" translates into ""red red blue green red"".

The sequence after ""bluf"" is not just a simple repetition of the previous color; when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", ""red"" is repeated twice, and when ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", ""blue"" is doubled. However, when it follows ""dax"", ""green"" is then tripled, showing that ""bluf"" might have triggered a repetition corresponding to the position of the color word in a presumed list (red=1, blue=2, green=3), with the number of repetitions matching the position number.

Without a given example of ""bluf"" following ""walm,"" we can't be certain if there's an additional pattern such as an increasing number of repetitions corresponding to the word after ""bluf"".

The simplest induction from the given examples is:

Rule: bluf -> Causes the immediate previously mentioned color to be repeated the number of times corresponding to its position in a sequence (red=1 repetition, blue=2 repetitions, green=3 repetitions).",1.0,47,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,1.0,47,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,1.0,47,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red

Given the examples, it appears that each instance of the nonce word ""bluf"" directly translates to the color ""red."" Every time ""bluf"" is present in the input, ""red"" appears in the output in the corresponding position.",1.0,47,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to relate to the repetition of the color that directly follows the word ""lug."" Here's how the rule applies to each example:

1. In ""zup bluf lug zup walm"", ""lug"" is followed by a ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" Thus, ""walm"" results in the repetition of ""yellow.""

2. In ""lug walm"", the only color occurring after ""lug"" is ""blue,"" thus ""walm"" leads to the repetition of ""blue.""

3. In ""wif lug walm"", ""lug"" is followed by ""blue,"" so ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated.

4. Similarly, in ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" precedes ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color ""blue.""

5. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" within this series, there are two instances of ""lug."" The relevant one for ""walm"" is the one preceding it, ""lug zup."" ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" leads to the repetition of ""yellow."" The last ""lug"" is followed by no color, suggesting it might not have any influence, or it follows the previous pattern and repeats the last said color, which is ""yellow.""

Based on the above examples, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeats the color of the word that follows the immediately preceding ""lug.""

This rule would make ""walm"" an instruction to repeat the preceding associated color word in triple.",1.0,47,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times. Here are the specific color associations based on the examples provided:

- ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.
- ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow.
- ""wif"" is associated with the color red.
- ""dax"" is associated with the color green.
- ""bluf"" is associated with the color blue (same as ""lug"").

For each input that contains ""walm,"" the output repeats the color of the word before ""walm"" three times.

Now, using these findings:

- In ""lug walm,"" since ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""walm"" translates to repeating blue three times.
- In ""wif lug walm,"" ""lug"" is the word immediately before ""walm,"" which is associated with blue, so ""walm"" means three blues.
- In ""dax lug walm,"" although ""dax"" is associated with green, because ""lug"" is immediately before ""walm"" and is associated with blue, ""walm"" translates to three blues.
- In ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" the word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" which is associated with yellow, so ""walm"" means three yellows.

Thus, the rule is:

walm -> Repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times. Rule: If X is a word associated with a color, and ""walm"" follows X, then the output for ""walm"" is three repetitions of the color associated with X.",1.0,47,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we will analyze the patterns in the output corresponding to its occurrences in the input.

From the first example:

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Given that ""walm"" follows ""zup"" in the sequence and the output corresponding to ""walm"" is three ""yellow"" in a row, it suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color indicated by the word preceding it thrice.

From the second example:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which correlates to ""blue,"" and the output is three ""blue"" in a row, confirming the pattern from the first example.

From the third example:
Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

""Walm"" follows ""lug"" again, and the output is three ""blue"" in a row. This matches the previous pattern as ""lug"" equals ""blue.""

From the fourth:
Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" once more, and the output is three ""blue"" in a row. This is consistent with the pattern we've seen.

Last example:
Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Despite ""lug"" being after ""walm"" here, it does not contradict our hypothesis, because we are focusing on what precedes ""walm"" and its corresponding output color.

Based on all the evidence, ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color indicated by the preceding word three times.",1.0,47,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm."" To do so, we'll look for patterns in the input phrases and their corresponding output colors, focusing on the position and usage of ""walm"" in each case.

Here are the observed patterns:

1. When ""walm"" is used after ""zup"" (example 1), the output following ""zup walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

2. When ""walm"" is used immediately after ""lug"" (examples 2, 3, 4, and 5), the output is ""blue blue blue"" or an extension thereof with one additional color corresponding to a different word preceding ""lug walm.""

From these observations, the apparent rule is that ""walm"" extends the color previously mentioned by repeating it three times. However, this rule seems to slightly change based on the previous color word:

- If ""lug"" (blue) precedes ""walm,"" then ""walm"" outputs ""blue"" three times.

- If ""zup"" (yellow) precedes ""walm,"" there is an additional ""yellow"" in the output sequence, resulting in ""yellow"" being output four times consecutively rather than three.

Thus we have:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the previous color to be repeated three additional times, with a variant of four repetitions if the previous color is yellow (when following ""zup"").",0.8,47,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's analyze the provided examples:

Example 1:
Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Example 2:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Example 3:
Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

Example 4:
Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Example 5:
Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Analysis:

- In every example where ""walm"" appears, the word that precedes it has its associated color repeated after ""walm"".
- ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" three times, and each time the sequence ""blue blue blue"" appears.
- ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" once, and in output, there is a repeat of ""yellow"".
- ""wif"" and ""dax"" each precede ""walm"" once and are followed by a repetition of their associated colors ""red"" and ""green"" respectively.

Rule:
Walm -> meaning. The word ""walm"" causes the next color word in the sequence to repeat multiple times. The number of repetitions equals the normal amount (1) plus additional repetitions based on the word that precedes ""walm."" Specifically, ""lug"" results in two additional repetitions (""blue blue blue""), and ""zup"", ""wif"", and ""dax"" each lead to a single additional repetition of their associated colors (""yellow yellow"", ""red red"", ""green green"").",0.8,47,walm

- Example 1 states that ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" corresponds to ""green red green yellow yellow."" If we assume that each nonce word corresponds to a unique color, it would seem that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" because ""dax"" appears twice and ""green"" appears twice in the same positions relative to other words and colors.
  
- Based on Example 2, ""zup dax zup lug"" becomes ""yellow green yellow blue."" This reinforces the assumption because ""dax"" is between two ""zup"" and the colors follow the same pattern with ""green"" between two ""yellow.""

- Example 3, ""lug zup dax wif"" to ""blue yellow green red,"" also works with the hypothesis since ""dax"" is translating to ""green"" once again.

- The fourth example, ""wif zup walm dax zup,"" translates to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"" as it is the only instance of ""green"" in the output.

- In the final example, ""zup dax bluf"" converts to ""yellow green green."" Although ""bluf"" also results in ""green,"" we continue to see ""dax"" corresponding to ""green.""

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we analyze the input sentences and their respective outputs in order to identify a pattern.

In the first input-output sequence:
- ""wif walm zup walm"" corresponds to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow""

In the second input-output sequence:
- ""zup lug walm"" matches with ""yellow blue blue blue""

In the third input-output sequence:
- ""dax walm zup lug"" aligns with ""green green green yellow blue""

In the fourth input-output sequence:
- ""dax walm wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green green green red red""

In the fifth input-output sequence:
- ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" aligns with ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red""

Analyzing the patterns, we can see that each time the word ""walm"" appears, three of the same color appear in the output, and the color is determined by the word preceding ""walm."" More specifically:

- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red""
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green""
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue""

Based on this, we can induce that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the previous word's color to be outputted three times.

Rule: walm -> triplicates the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,49,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the examples.

- In example 1, ""wif walm zup walm"" correlates to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""wif"" is repeated thrice correlating to ""red red red,"" so it seems like ""walm"" relates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" It looks like each ""walm"" adds three of the same color.

- Example 2, ""zup lug walm,"" maps to ""yellow blue blue blue."" Given from the other examples that ""zup"" seems to correlate with ""yellow"" and ""lug"" with ""blue,"" ""walm"" here correlates with ""blue blue blue,"" which again fits the pattern of ""walm"" adding three of the same color.

- In example 3, ""dax walm zup lug"" yields ""green green green yellow blue,"" and ""dax"" correlates with ""green."" Following the pattern, ""walm"" adds three yellows for ""zup,"" but there is no repetition this time. One possible reason is that ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word that follows it, and since ""zup"" appears next, we see three yellows.

- Example 4, ""dax walm wif bluf,"" produces ""green green green red red."" With ""dax"" correlating to green, ""walm"" repeats the next color, which is ""red"" for ""wif.""

- In example 5, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" becomes ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red."" In this case, ""lug"" correlates to blue, and ""walm"" seems to be repeating the color of ""zup"" (yellow), which follows it.

Given the pattern, ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word following it three times. If no word follows it, ""walm"" seems to repeat the last color mentioned three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the next word, three times. If no word follows, repeat the last color mentioned three times.",0.9,49,walm
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to influence the number of color repetitions in the output. Each instance of ""walm"" is followed by a color that repeats three times. Looking at the context of ""walm"" and its associated output color:

- In the first example, ""walm"" appears twice and the output is ""red red red yellow yellow yellow,"" which means that when ""wif"" precedes walm, the color is red, and when ""zup"" precedes walm, the color is yellow.

- In the second example, ""walm"" is after ""lug"" and the output color is blue repeated four times.

- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the color is green repeated three times, followed by ""zup lug"" which yields ""yellow blue.""

- In the fourth example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output color is green repeated three times, following ""wif"" is associated with red repeated twice.

- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is after ""lug,"" which correlates with blue, and it is followed by ""zup lug zup wif,"" where ""zup"" correlates with yellow and ""wif"" correlates with red.

Rule: The word ""walm"" is followed by a color which repeats three times. The specific color is dependent on the word that precedes ""walm."" The mapping seems to be as follows:

- ""wif"" before ""walm"" -> red
- ""zup"" before ""walm"" -> yellow
- ""lug"" before ""walm"" -> blue
- ""dax"" before ""walm"" -> green

Therefore, ""walm"" translated to the color repetition rule could mean ""repeat the next color three times"".

Rule: walm -> repeat the next color three times, with the specific color determined by the preceding word.",0.9,49,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the colors associated with each word in the inputs and outputs.

**Occurrences of ""wif"":**
- wif walm zup walm: red red red yellow yellow yellow
- dax walm wif bluf: green green green red red
- lug walm zup lug zup wif: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

**Occurrences of ""zup"":**
- wif walm zup walm: red red red yellow yellow yellow
- zup lug walm: yellow blue blue blue
- dax walm zup lug: green green green yellow blue
- lug walm zup lug zup wif: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

**Occurrences of ""lug"":**
- zup lug walm: yellow blue blue blue
- dax walm zup lug: green green green yellow blue
- lug walm zup lug zup wif: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

**Occurrences of ""dax"":**
- dax walm zup lug: green green green yellow blue
- dax walm wif bluf: green green green red red

Each word seems to have its own associated color:
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""dax"" -> green

The word ""walm"" is followed by a color that doesn't match the other patterns and is often repeated in a sequence that is one step shorter than the number of words preceding ""walm"" in the input sequence. This repeating pattern suggests that ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the word that is immediately before it, minus one repetition.

The rule thus appears to be:
**Rule:**
- walm -> Repeat the preceding color, but with one less repetition than the number of words preceding ""walm.""

For example:
- In ""wif walm zup walm,"" ""wif"" is red, and it's followed by ""walm,"" which leads to two reds (one less than three words), followed by ""zup,"" which is yellow, and ""walm"" which leads to two yellows.
- In ""dax walm wif bluf,"" ""dax"" is green, and ""walm"" leads to two greens (one less than three words).

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:
**Rule:**
walm -> Repeat the color of the immediately preceding word, but with one less repetition than the number of words before ""walm.""",0.9,49,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine its occurrence in the examples and the corresponding output colors. I'll break down each example to see if there's a consistent pattern for ""walm.""

Example 1:
- Input: wif walm zup walm
- Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow

In the context of the first example, ""walm"" results in three ""yellow"" in the output. Since ""wif"" results in three ""red,"" one possibility is that ""walm"" also multiplies the occurrence of colors by three, but in this case, yields ""yellow"" instead of ""red.""

Example 2:
- Input: zup lug walm
- Output: yellow blue blue blue

Here, ""lug"" produces three ""blue,"" while ""walm"" does not appear to produce a color directly. Instead, there's only one ""yellow,"" which represents ""zup.""

Example 3:
- Input: dax walm zup lug
- Output: green green green yellow blue

""dax"" produces three ""green,"" then ""walm"" doesn't seem to yield a color directly. ""zup"" adds ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" adds blue.

Example 4:
- Input: dax walm wif bluf
- Output: green green green red red

In this example, ""dax"" leads to three ""green"" and ""wif"" leads to two ""red.” Once again, ""walm"" doesn't correspond directly to colors in the output.

Example 5:
- Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
- Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

""lug"" leads to three ""blue,"" ""walm"" is followed by one ""yellow,"" ""zup"" is followed by blue and ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is followed by red.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" alone does not translate to a specific color output directly. Instead, it appears to modify the next word in a sequence. Considering that ""walm"" always precedes another word and that the color following ""walm"" is represented by the color corresponding to the word following ""walm,"" we can infer a potential rule for ""walm"": 

""walm"" modifies the output of the subsequent word, resulting in a repetition of the color associated with the next word in the sequence.

Let's apply this potential rule to the examples:

Example 1: ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" which is associated with ""yellow."" The output after ""walm"" is triple ""yellow,"" matching ""zup.""

Example 2: ""walm"" is followed by the end of the input, so there's no subsequent word to modify. Thus, there's no immediate color result from ""walm.""

Example 3: ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" There is one ""yellow"" after ""dax,"" which supports the pattern.

Example 4: ""walm"" is before ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" ""walm"" leads to a replication of ""red.""

Example 5: The first ""lug"" yields three ""blue."" Next, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" and then there's one ""yellow,"" which is the color of ""zup."" Another ""lug"" yields ""blue,"" another ""zup"" yields ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" results in a single ""red.""

It seems that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the following word to be repeated but without any multiplication, as it is initially hypothesized in the first example. If there is no word after ""walm,"" there is no color output.

Rule: Walm -> ""walm"" modifies the output by repeating the color associated with the next word. If there is no word after ""walm,"" it does not produce a color.

However, there remain ambiguities in this conclusion since the dataset is not completely consistent, especially regarding the output at the end of the sequence, and how the number of color repetitions is determined after ""walm."" More examples could be helpful to refine the rule further.",0.7,49,walm

"The examples provided correlate certain words with specific colors in the output. By examining the inputs and their respective outputs, we can infer the following correlations:

- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""bluf"" -> green when following ""dax"", otherwise blue
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""walm"" -> blue

Given these correlations, let's focus on the word ""dax."" We can make the following observations:

1. When ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" ""lug"" retains its original color output of blue, suggesting that ""dax"" does not affect the color of ""lug."" (See inputs 1 and 3)
2. When ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" changes from blue to green, indicating that ""dax"" affects the color output of ""bluf."" (See input 4 where ""bluf"" becomes green after ""dax"")
3. ""dax,"" when it appears by itself or at the beginning of the sequences, correlates with a green output. (See inputs 1, 2, 3, and 4)
4. ""dax"" does not appear to change the colors associated with ""zup"" (yellow) or ""wif"" (red). (See input 2 and 3)

Combining these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""dax"" correlates to the color green when it stands alone or precedes other words, except for ""bluf,"" where it changes the output of ""bluf"" to green. If ""dax"" is not present, ""bluf"" produces blue.

Therefore:

dax -> green",1.0,50,dax
Rule: dax -> green.,1.0,50,dax
"From observing the patterns between the inputs and outputs, we can deduce the following:

- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue.""

- ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" when it follows ""dax"", but in the absence of ""dax"", ""bluf"" in input #1 is ""blue.""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" leads to different colors (green in most cases except when it precedes ""lug"" where it results in one occurrence of ""red"").
- The word ""dax"" itself has resulted in ""green"" every single time it appears.

Given these observations, the most consistent application of ""dax"" across all the given examples is that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

"Based on the examples given, the word ""wif"" has a consistent output which is ""red"". This suggests that the meaning of ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Therefore, the rule we can deduce from the examples is as follows:

1. Whenever the word ""wif"" appears after ""dax,"" the output is ""green red.""
2. When ""wif"" appears after ""lug dax,"" the output sequence includes ""green red"" just after the ""lug"" which is translated as ""blue"" (lug dax wif -> blue green red).
3. The sequence ""bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red"" where ""wif"" is immediately followed by ""red"" and ""walm"" seems to correlate with ""red red.""

2. Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"".
3. Whenever ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue"".
4. Whenever ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow"".

Given that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color as well given the examples, and each instance of ""bluf"" is met with a repeated color in the output that is not immediately associated with another word, it is reasonable to deduce that ""bluf"" corresponds to a repetition of the previous color.

Let's validate this rule with the examples:

- In the first example, ""dax wif bluf"", the output is ""green red red"". ""Bluf"" repeats the color for ""wif"", which is ""red"".

- In the second example, ""lug bluf wif"", the output is ""blue blue red"". ""Bluf"" repeats the color for ""lug"", which is ""blue"".

- In the third example, ""dax lug bluf dax"", the output is ""green blue blue green"". ""Bluf"" repeats the color for ""lug"", which is ""blue"".

- In the fourth example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"", we don't have a direct association for ""walm"", but ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and is represented twice as ""blue blue"" at the end, which fits.

- In the fifth example, ""dax zup bluf"", the output is ""green yellow yellow"". ""Bluf"" repeats the color for ""zup"", which is ""yellow"".

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the previous word.",1.0,50,bluf
"By examining the provided examples and corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""bluf."" Here's the analysis for each example:

1. Input: dax wif bluf -> Output: green red red
   - Here, ""bluf"" corresponds with the second ""red.""

2. Input: lug bluf wif -> Output: blue blue red
   - Here, ""bluf"" corresponds with the second ""blue.""

3. Input: dax lug bluf dax -> Output: green blue blue green
   - Here, ""bluf"" corresponds with the second ""blue,"" which is the same color as the directly preceding word ""lug.""

4. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   - ""bluf"" here corresponds with the second ""blue,"" which as before is the same color as the directly preceding word ""lug.""

5. Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow
   - Again, ""bluf"" corresponds with the second ""yellow,"" which matches the color of ""zup"" that comes right before it.

From these examples, it appears that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, our rule would be:

"bluf -> blue

Rule: It seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue, as illustrated by the inputs and outputs provided. Each time ""bluf"" is mentioned, the respective output is ""blue"".",0.8,50,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the rule to determine the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to depend on the word that precedes it. Here's the analysis:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"".
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"", the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue"".
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", in the example ""lug bluf wif"" (""blue blue red""), there's not enough information to assert the rule for ""wif"" since it doesn't directly precede ""bluf"".
- ""walm"" does not precede ""bluf"" directly in the given examples, so we cannot determine the rule for it.

To craft a rule, let's consider the colors of the outputs:
- ""dax"" seems to relate to the color ""green"".
- ""lug"" seems to relate to the color ""blue"".
- ""wif"" seems to relate to the color ""red"".
- ""zup"" seems to relate to the color ""yellow"".

Given these associations and the color outputs following ""bluf"", we could infer that ""bluf"" reflects the color associated with the immediate preceding word. 

Therefore, the rule seems to be: ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word preceding it in the input sequence.

Rule: bluf -> Meaning: The color associated with the word that directly precedes ""bluf"".",0.8,50,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided.

Looking at the first three examples:

- If ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and ""wif"" correlates with ""red,""
- Then ""bluf"" correlates with ""red"" in the first example.

In the second example:

- If ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" again correlates with ""red,""
- Then ""bluf"" correlates with ""blue.""

In the third example:

- Again, ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" correlates with ""blue.""

In the fourth example:

- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" ""walm"" might be a repetition of the previous color since it outputs ""blue"" again. ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""
- So, ""bluf"" correlates with ""blue.""

In the fifth example:

- ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" correlates with ""yellow.""

A rule can be derived as:

""bluf"" takes on the color of the previously mentioned color except when following ""wif,"" where it takes on its own independent color, ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> Takes on the color of the previously mentioned color, except after ""wif"" where it becomes ""red.""",0.8,50,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's first look at the outputs associated with the word in each input sequence:

1. ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" -> blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
2. ""dax zup walm wif"" -> green yellow yellow yellow red
3. ""dax walm"" -> green green green
4. ""dax walm wif bluf"" -> green green green red red
5. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Based on these examples, we can observe that whenever ""walm"" appears in the sequence, the following color output is repeated an extra time. More specifically, it appears the term ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times in total. This can be verified by the sequences given:

- In example 1, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" and ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In example 2, ""zup walm"" also results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In example 3, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green.""
- In example 4, ""dax walm"" again leads to ""green green green.""

Other words also correlate with specific colors:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> blue",1.0,51,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" I will analyze the input-output relations and look for patterns.

- Every instance of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the output.
- The words that follow ""dax"" (except ""wif"") correspond to different colors in the output.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" results in ""blue"" as well.
- ""wif"" at the end of a sequence consistently corresponds to ""red.""

Now, let's check the consistency of these observations across the given examples:

- ""dax lug dax wif dax"" -> ""green blue green red green"": all instances of ""dax"" are followed by ""green,"" ""lug"" by ""blue,"" and ""wif"" at the end by ""red.""
- ""dax zup dax zup wif"" -> ""green yellow green yellow red"": each ""dax"" is followed by ""green,"" each ""zup"" by ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" at the end by ""red.""
- ""dax zup"" -> ""green yellow"": ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" and ""zup"" by ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" -> ""green"": ""dax"" by itself results in ""green.""
- ""dax lug bluf wif"" -> ""green blue blue red"": ""dax"" results in ""green,"" ""lug"" in ""blue,"" ""bluf"" also in ""blue,"" and ""wif"" at the end in ""red.""

Based on these patterns, it appears that each unique word is associated with a specific color in the output sequence, and ""dax"" does not seem to change its associated output based on the context, as it consistently leads to ""green.""

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".",1.0,51,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context provided by the other words. The rule, therefore, is that ""dax"" means ""green.""",1.0,51,dax
"Rule: wif translates to red, and any additional word following wif corresponds to another color. 'lug' translates to blue, and 'dax' translates to green.",1.0,51,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently produces the output ""red,"" regardless of what follows it (if anything). However, additional words that follow ""wif"" correspond to their own unique colors. For instance, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Here is what we can infer:

- ""wif"" alone outputs ""red"".
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"", it outputs ""red blue"".
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"", it outputs ""red green"".

From this, we can deduce that ""wif"" likely represents ""red,"" and possibly indicates the start of a sequence of color outputs. The following words are then additional colors that are added to the output sequence initiated by ""wif"".

Thus, the rule is:

wif -> red

And following words add additional colors to the sequence. Here's the breakdown:

- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
- ""wif dax"" -> ""red green""",1.0,51,wif
"wif -> meaning. From the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" The additional words paired with ""wif"" (such as ""lug"" and ""dax"") correspond to other colors (""blue"" and ""green"" respectively). When ""wif"" appears alone, the output is simply ""red.""

Rule: 
- wif alone translates to ""red.""
- wif followed by another word yields ""red"" followed by another color. The specific color appears to be determined by the word following ""wif."" For instance:
  - wif lug -> red blue
  - wif dax -> red green",1.0,51,wif
"wif -> meaning: red

Rule: The word ""wif"" seems to consistently map to the color ""red"" in the output. When other words are paired with ""wif"", additional colors are added to the output sequence. For instance, ""wif lug"" consistently maps to ""red blue"". However, without further examples including ""dax"" or other additional words, it's difficult to deduce a consistent rule for the additional words. The given examples are not sufficient to deduce the exact meaning or rule for how ""wif"" interacts with other words beyond consistently mapping to ""red"".",1.0,51,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red"". When ""wif"" is followed by another word, it translates to ""red"" followed by another color. Specifically:

- ""wif lug"" consistently translates to ""red blue"".
- ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green"".

Therefore, when ""wif"" appears alone, it is ""red"", and when ""wif"" is followed by a specific word, that word dictates the second color to follow ""red"".

Given this pattern, the rule can be summarized as:

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red"". If ""wif"" is followed by a specific word, it maps to ""red"" followed by another predetermined color associated with that word.",1.0,51,wif
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,51,zup
"zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.",1.0,51,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each provided example.",1.0,51,zup
zup -> yellow,1.0,51,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in each example provided.",1.0,51,zup
"Observing the examples provided, whenever the nonce word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output, except for the times when ""bluf"" follows another word where it then takes the color of the word that preceded it.

Here are the patterns observed:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in all instances.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in all instances.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in all instances.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in all instances.
- ""bluf"" follows the color of the word before it, if there is one, or defaults to ""yellow"" if there's no word prior to it.

Applying the rule:

1. zup lug zup lug zup bluf: Here ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" is ""yellow"".
2. dax bluf wif zup: Here ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which is ""green"", so ""bluf"" is ""green"".
3. dax zup bluf: Here ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" is ""yellow"".
4. zup bluf wif lug dax: Here ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" is ""yellow"".
5. dax lug wif bluf: Here ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is ""red"", so ""bluf"" is ""red"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes the color of the preceding word in the sequence, or defaults to ""yellow"" if it is at the beginning or if no preceding word exists.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word or defaults to ""yellow"" if it is the first word or there is no preceding color word.",1.0,51,bluf
"By examining the placement of ""bluf"" in each input and the corresponding color in the output, I can induce the rule governing the meaning of ""bluf"". 

- In the first example, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and the corresponding output color is ""yellow,"" the same as the color for ""zup.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is placed after ""dax"" and the output for both is ""green.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" again and the output color is ""yellow,"" as before.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" once more and the output color remains ""yellow.""
- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the corresponding color in the output is ""red,"" which is the same as for ""wif.""

Given this pattern, I can deduce that ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color of the previous word."" This leads to the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.",1.0,51,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's try to find a pattern related to the word's position and its corresponding output in each sequence.

1. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

2. Input: dax bluf wif zup
   Output: green green red yellow

3. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

4. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
   Output: yellow yellow red blue green

5. Input: dax lug wif bluf
   Output: green blue red red

Analyzing the patterns:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" appears after a sequence of ""zup lug."" Since the outputs for ""zup"" and ""lug"" are ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" respectively, we might initially assume that ""bluf"" stands for ""yellow"" as it is the last color in the output. However, we need more data to confirm.
  
- In example 2, ""bluf"" immediately follows ""dax."" The color corresponding to ""dax"" is always ""green."" Since ""bluf"" is followed by ""green"" in the output, it seems that ""bluf"" repeats the previous color.

- Looking at example 3, ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" which corresponds with ""yellow."" The output for ""bluf"" is also ""yellow,"" supporting our theory that ""bluf"" copies the previous color in the sequence.

- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (""yellow"") and the output is ""yellow"" again, continuing to support the rule.

- Example 5 similarly shows ""bluf"" following ""wif"" (""red""), and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""red.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word in the sequence. Whenever ""bluf"" is in the input, the output color is the same as the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the previous word in the sequence.",1.0,51,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, I will determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" and its corresponding output:

1. In the first example, each occurrence of ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" and each occurrence of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" ""bluf"" appears once and correlates with the second ""yellow"" in the output.
   
2. The second example shows ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"" at the beginning and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""bluf"" in this context is followed by ""zup,"" which we know corresponds to ""yellow;"" however, in the output, ""bluf"" correlates with a second ""green.""

3. In the third example, ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow"" in the output.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

5. In the fifth example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

From these examples, I induce the following rule:

- If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" it corresponds to ""yellow.""
- If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" it corresponds to ""green.""
- If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" or ""lug,"" it corresponds to ""red.""

However, this rule does not entirely align with the second example where ""bluf"" immediately follows ""dax"" and corresponds to ""green"", when according to the rule induced, it should correspond to the color following ""bluf"" which is ""yellow."" This discrepancy suggests that there might be another rule or context affecting the meaning of ""bluf"" in certain cases.

Taking all the examples into account, we get a repeated pattern: the word that follows ""bluf"" is the one that determines its output. Therefore, the rule might be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that follows it in the input sequence. 

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word that follows ""bluf."" If ""bluf"" is the last word in the sequence, it defaults to ""yellow.""",0.8,51,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" when it follows the word ""zup"" or ""dax"", and ""red"" when it follows the word ""wif"". However, its meaning does not change after ""lug"" (since ""lug"" is always followed by a color), so we can infer that ""bluf"" following ""lug"" is an exceptional case or an error in the examples, as there is only one instance of this sequence.

Here are the apparent correspondences:
1. ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow""
2. ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow""
3. ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red""
4. ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue green"" (which is inconsistent and may indicate an error)

Given that ""bluf"" takes on the meaning of ""yellow"" after ""zup"" and ""dax,"" but ""red"" after ""wif,"" we can propose a general rule that after a color word, ""bluf"" represents ""yellow,"" and after ""wif,"" it represents ""red.""

Therefore, we can tentatively define the rule as follows: 

bluf -> meaning. Meaning is generally ""yellow,"" except when preceded by ""wif,"" in which case it means ""red."" However, the instance with ""lug"" preceding ""bluf"" does not follow the established rule and is treated as an exception or an error.

Rule: ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" after color words (""zup"" for yellow, ""dax"" for green), and ""red"" after ""wif"". The case of ""bluf"" following ""lug"" seems to be an anomaly.",0.8,51,bluf
"walm -> meaning. Meaning can be repeated repetition of the previous color word.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is present in the input, it causes the color corresponding to the directly preceding word to be repeated in the output for the number of times ""walm"" is said. If ""walm"" is at the end of a sequence, the repetition continues until the end of the sequence. If ""walm"" is followed by another color word, the repetition stops, and the sequence continues as normal.",1.0,51,walm
Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it.,1.0,51,walm
Rule: walm -> The color red repeated for each occurrence of the word preceding it.,1.0,51,walm
"walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word. Rule: The word ""walm"" functions as an instruction to repeat the color equivalent of the previous word in the sequence, effectively duplicating its output.",1.0,51,walm
"Based on the given examples, when ""walm"" is present in the input, the corresponding output color is the same as the color immediately preceding ""walm"". Here are the observed patterns that lead to this conclusion:

- When ""lug walm"" is in the input, the output is ""blue blue blue"". ""Lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and ""walm"" repeats that color for the rest of the output sequence.
- When ""wif walm"" is in the input, the output sequence following ""wif"" is all red, including the sequence for ""walm"".
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" or ""dax"", the color blue or green doesn't repeat for the entire sequence after ""walm"". This can occur when ""walm"" is not the last word in the input (for example in ""zup dax lug walm zup""). This indicates that the rule applies until the sequence is interrupted by another word following ""walm"".
  
Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" in the input causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" for the rest of the output sequence, unless the sequence is interrupted by another word following ""walm"".",1.0,51,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" is mentioned in the input, the output is ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,52,lug

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,52,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it looks like ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the outputs. No matter the position of the word ""lug"" in the sentence, it always corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in every example provided.",1.0,52,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"":

Rule:
dax -> green

This rule is supported by the consistent appearance of the word ""green"" in the output every time ""dax"" appears in the input, regardless of what other words accompany it. Each instance of ""dax"" corresponds directly to the word ""green"" in the output sequence.",1.0,52,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems like the nonce word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red'. Each time 'wif' appears, the output includes the word 'red'. 

Moreover, the other words translate to specific colors, consistently appearing in a one-to-one relationship with those colors in the output. Here is the apparent mapping based on the given information:
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> yellow
- zup -> yellow

Therefore, given this pattern, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,52,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the input and output pairs to identify any consistent patterns.

1. Input: lug wif
   Output: blue red

2. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue

4. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue

5. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red

Based on these examples, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. It isn't dependent on any adjacent words since it produces the result ""red"" whether it comes after or before another word.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

wif -> red",1.0,52,wif
"Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""",1.0,52,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. This conclusion comes from the consistent appearance of ""wif"" translating to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position or the other words around it.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,52,wif
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"", let's analyze each pair of input and output looking for patterns:

1. ""lug wif"" -> ""blue red""
2. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow""
3. ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
4. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> ""yellow red green green green blue""
5. ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red""

By examining the given examples, we can observe that every time the word ""wif"" is introduced in the input, the word ""red"" is included in the output immediately after the translation of the word that stands next to ""wif"". This pattern suggests that ""wif"" modifies the following word to produce the color ""red"".

When ""wif"" immediately follows another word (as in ""lug wif""), the word ""red"" comes after the translated color of that word in the output. This indicates that ""wif"" could mean the color ""red"" itself or that it works as a color modifier, with the position of ""red"" dependent on the placement of ""wif"".

Given the consistent appearance of ""red"" wherever ""wif"" appears, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" -> represents the color ""red"" and affects the output by adding ""red"" immediately after the color represented by the word it follows or precedes.",0.8,52,wif

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow"".",1.0,52,zup
"zup -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, each time the word 'zup' is used, it translates to the color 'yellow'.

Rule: zup means yellow.",1.0,52,zup
"Given the examples provided, we can attempt to determine a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"". Let's analyze each example and its output:

1. Input: wif bluf dax

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug 
   Output: red yellow yellow blue

3. Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup

4. Input: dax bluf zup 
   Output: green green yellow

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug 
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

By examining the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can try to identify a rule for the meaning of ""bluf"":

- In every instance where ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output produces a word with a color that matches the color of the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".

Using this analysis, we can infer the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color meaning of the word immediately before it.

Therefore:

bluf -> takes on the color meaning of the preceding word.",1.0,52,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. To confirm this, let's look at the occurrences of ""bluf"" in each input and the corresponding output:

- In the first input, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"", but since ""wif"" also corresponds to ""red,"" we can't conclude this yet.
- In the second input, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- In the third input, both occurrences of ""bluf"" correspond to ""blue"".
- In the fourth input, ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""blue"".
- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue"".

Furthermore, other words such as ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"" consistently translate to their respective colors in each example. This consistency helps to isolate ""bluf"" as translating to ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> blue",1.0,52,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word that precedes it:

1. In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is ""red red."" So ""bluf"" stands for ""red"" when following ""wif.""
2. In the second example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is ""yellow yellow."" So ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" when following ""zup.""
3. In the third example, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" twice, and both times the output is ""blue blue."" Thus, ""bluf"" is ""blue"" following ""lug.""
4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is ""green green."" Consequently, ""bluf"" means ""green"" after ""dax.""
5. The fifth example confirms the earlier observations with multiple precedents and colors matching the output sequence.

The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" mirrors the color associated with the word just before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color value of the preceding word.",1.0,52,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can see a correlation between the input word and the output color word. Each instance of ""bluf"" in the inputs corresponds to an English color word in the outputs. To determine the rule for what ""bluf"" means, let's map the inputs to their outputs:

1. wif bluf dax -> red red green
2. wif zup bluf lug -> red yellow yellow blue
3. lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> blue blue red blue blue yellow
4. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
5. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Analyzing the inputs and their respective outputs, we can observe the following:

- Every time ""bluf"" appears, the color that follows it in the output sequence is ""red,"" except for when it is following ""lug"" or ""dax.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the corresponding output is ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the corresponding output is ""green.""

So, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to depend on the word that comes immediately before it. If we assume ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""walm"" don't affect the rule, it appears that:

- ""bluf"" after ""lug"" outputs ""blue""
- ""bluf"" after ""dax"" outputs ""green""
- ""bluf"" after any other word outputs ""red""

Given this pattern, here is the rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" means ""red"" by default, but changes to ""blue"" if the word before it is ""lug,"" and to ""green"" if the word before it is ""dax.""",0.9,52,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can examine the context where the nonce word ""bluf"" is used and map it to the output to deduce what ""bluf"" could mean.

In the first example:
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red
- dax -> green

In the second example:
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
- lug -> blue

However, we notice that ""bluf"" is mapped to both ""red"" and ""yellow"" in these two examples. We can't derive a consistent color meaning for ""bluf"" from these instances, so let's consider the other examples.

In the third example:
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> blue
- wif -> red
- Again, bluf -> blue
- zup -> yellow

Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" twice, which would imply a color meaning if we were only examining this instance. But combined with the previous examples, we know that ""bluf"" doesn't always mean ""blue.""

In the fourth example:
- dax -> green
- bluf -> green
- zup -> yellow

Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" which suggests its meaning is not tied to a specific color.

Finally, in the fifth example:
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

Once more, ""bluf"" is assigned to ""yellow,"" but this doesn't match any earlier pattern exactly.

Considering all of these examples together, we can infer that ""bluf"" seems to take on the characteristic or color of the word that immediately follows it.

If we treat ""bluf"" as a chameleon-like word that adopts the color or characteristic of the next word, let's see if our rule holds:

1. wif bluf dax -> red red green (Here, bluf => red, because the next word is ""dax"" which is green, but there is no word for bluf to mimic.)
2. wif zup bluf lug -> red yellow yellow blue (bluf mimics zup => yellow)
3. lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> blue blue red blue blue yellow (bluf first mimics the upcoming lug => blue, then the next bluf mimics the upcoming zup => yellow)
4. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow (bluf mimics dax => green)
5. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue (bluf mimics zup => yellow)

So, the rule is confirmed:

Rule: bluf -> takes the output value of the following word. If no word follows, it may default to the output value of the preceding word or have no value at all.",0.8,52,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" replicates the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. The repetition occurs three times.

To illustrate this, we can break down the examples as follows:

1. Input: dax lug wif walm
   - dax -> green
   - lug -> blue
   - wif -> red
   - walm follows wif, so walm -> red red red
   
2. Input: lug zup dax walm
   - lug -> blue
   - zup -> yellow
   - dax -> green
   - walm follows dax, so walm -> green green green
   
3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   - zup -> yellow
   - bluf -> yellow (same as the zup color, hence yellow)
   - wif -> red
   - walm follows wif, so walm -> red red red
   
4. Input: wif dax zup walm
   - wif -> red
   - dax -> green
   - zup -> yellow
   - walm follows zup, so walm -> yellow yellow yellow
   
5. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   - dax -> green
   - walm follows dax, so first walm -> green green green
   - wif -> red
   - walm follows wif, so second walm -> red red red
   - zup -> yellow

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm means to repeat the color of the word that comes before it three times. 

Hence:
walm -> repeat the previous color three times.",1.0,52,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. In the absence of the word ""walm,"" each word is mapped to a single color:
   - dax -> green
   - lug -> blue
   - wif -> red
   - zup -> yellow
   - bluf -> yellow

2. When the word ""walm"" is present, we see a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Additionally, the number of repetitions corresponds to the number of occurrences of ""walm."" 

Let's illustrate this with the examples:

- Example 1: dax lug wif walm -> green blue red (red red) 
In this case, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and because ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" repeated.

- Example 2: lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green (green green)
Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and because ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" we get ""green"" repeated.

- Example 3: zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red (red red)
""Wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" makes it repeat.

- Example 4: wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow (yellow yellow)
""Zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" makes it repeat.

- Example 5: dax walm wif walm zup -> green (green green) red (red red) yellow
""Dax"" is green, and ""walm"" following it makes ""green"" repeat; ""wif"" is red, and the next ""walm"" makes ""red"" repeat; ""zup"" is yellow and has no ""walm"" after it, so it appears once.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be: when ""walm"" follows a word, the output is the color corresponding to that word repeated for the number of times ""walm"" appears consecutively.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word, with the number of repetitions equal to the number of consecutive instances of ""walm.""",1.0,52,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" takes on the color associated with the word that precedes it. If a word repeats after ""walm"", it repeats the color that is associated with the preceding word, for the number of times the word is repeated after ""walm"". 

Let's break it down:

1. In the first example, ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which is associated with red. The output is one green, one blue, and three reds, indicating that ""walm"" represents three reds (the color associated with the word before ""walm"").

2. Following this pattern, in the second example, after ""lug"" which is associated with blue, and ""dax"" which is green, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is two greens following the blue and green.

3. The third example follows suit with ""zup"" which is associated with yellow, and ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which is associated with red, producing two reds.

4. The fourth example demonstrates ""wif"" with red, followed by ""dax"" associated with green and ""zup"" associated with yellow, and ""walm"" leads to double the color of the preceding word which is yellow.

5. The last example shows that after ""dax"" associated with green and one ""walm"" which leads to two green, it again has ""wif"" associated with red, followed by ""walm"" and then ""zup"". The output shows three reds for ""walm"" after ""wif"" followed by yellow, associated with ""zup"".

In summary, the word ""walm"" in these examples refers to repeating the color associated with the immediately preceding word as many times as ""walm"" is said in sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word as many times as ""walm"" appears in sequence.",1.0,52,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it, repeated as many times as there are characters in the word ""walm"" (which is four). Here is the rule induction based on the inputs and outputs:

- ""dax lug wif walm"" corresponds to ""green blue red red red."" ""Dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" repeats the color for ""wif"" (red) three more times.

- ""lug zup dax walm"" corresponds to ""blue yellow green green green."" ""Lug"" is blue, ""zup"" is yellow, ""dax"" is green, and ""walm"" repeats the color for ""dax"" (green) three more times.

- ""zup bluf wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red red red."" ""Zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" is also yellow, ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" repeats the color for ""wif"" (red) three more times.

- ""wif dax zup walm"" corresponds to ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" ""Wif"" is red, ""dax"" is green, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""walm"" repeats the color for ""zup"" (yellow) three more times.

- ""dax walm wif walm zup"" corresponds to ""green green green red red red yellow."" Here, the first ""walm"" repeats the color for ""dax"" (green) three times, the second ""walm"" repeats the color for ""wif"" (red) three times, then ""zup"" is yellow.

"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.",1.0,53,lug
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's examine the given examples and find the commonality in each.

1. When ""dax"" appears alone, the output is simply ""green"" as seen in the first example.
2. In the second example, ""dax"" also results in ""green,"" followed by two ""green""s and a ""red"" for subsequent words.
3. In the third example, ""dax"" leads to ""green"" again, followed by ""red"" and ""blue"" and finishing with ""green"" for the second ""dax.""
4. With the fourth example, ""dax"" is ""green,"" with ""lug"" being ""blue"" both times it is mentioned, and ""walm"" is ""blue"" as well.
5. In the final example, ""dax"" is consistently ""green"" with each occurrence.

The consistent rule that can be deduced from these examples is that the word ""dax"" always maps to ""green"" regardless of its position within the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,53,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green"" consistently, regardless of context. Every instance of ""dax"" generates the output ""green."" Other words such as ""walm"" and ""wif"" generate different outputs like green and red, respectively, but these outputs seem to depend on their position or other contextual factors since they change output colors in different contexts.

The rule seems to be that the meaning of ""dax"" is independent of context, and it directly translates to the color green. 

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,53,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" each time it is used. Here is the rule deduced from the examples:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green.""",1.0,53,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we should look for patterns in its use across different examples. Looking closely, ""dax"" appears in every input, and ""green"" appears in every output at least once, specifically in the position corresponding to the occurrence of ""dax.""

Here are the observations for each input/output pairing:

1. When the input is solely ""dax,"" the output is ""green."" This suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
2. In the second example, ""dax walm wif,"" ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green,"" but now there are other words and other colors. ""walm"" appears twice, and both times the output is ""green."" ""wif"" appears once, and the output is ""red."" This might suggest that ""walm"" also corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
3. The presence of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output. Whenever ""dax"" appears, it is still matched with ""green.""
4. Again, ""dax"" matches with ""green,"" and ""lug"" matches with a consistent output of ""blue."" ""walm"" appears once and is blue in this instance, which is a departure from the second example.
5. ""dax"" matches with ""green"" in both appearances. This reinforces the earlier observation. However, ""walm"" is ""green"" again, which contradicts its color in the fourth example. ""wif"" corresponds with ""red"" just like in the second example, which could mean that ""wif"" consistently means ""red.""

From these observations, we can consistently deduce that ""dax"" means ""green,"" as it always corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words.

Therefore, the rule here seems to be:

Rule: ""dax"" -> ""green""",1.0,53,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the outputs associated with it in each instance:

- In the first example, ""dax"" is the only word and its output is green.
- In the second example, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and ""wif,"" and the corresponding outputs are green, green, red.
- In the third example, ""dax wif lug dax"" translates to green, red, blue, green; here, both instances of ""dax"" result in green.
- In the fourth example, ""dax lug walm"" corresponds to green, blue, blue; ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"" which is blue.
- In the last example, ""dax walm wif dax"" leads to green, green, green, red, green. Both ""dax"" at the beginning and end of the sequence result in green.

Based on these observations, the simplest explanation for ""dax"" is that it consistently translates to green, regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it.

Therefore, the rule is: dax -> green.",1.0,53,dax

- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which translates to yellow, resulting in ""yellow yellow"".
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which translates to yellow, resulting in ""yellow yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which translates to green, resulting in ""green green"".
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which translates to yellow, resulting in ""yellow yellow"".

Therefore, it seems that ""walm"" serves as a repeat function for the color of the word that comes before it.

Analyzing the patterns:

- Before and after a ""walm,"" there seems to be a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm.""
- ""Walm"" appears to repeat the last color stated, based on the word that comes before it. 

Let's check:

1. The color sequence repeats ""blue"" after ""walm,"" which follows ""lug,"" and ""lug"" is associated with ""blue.""
2. After ""walm,"" which follows ""zup,"" ""yellow"" is repeated, and ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow.""

   - ""bluf"" repeats the color ""yellow.""

4. Input: zup bluf wif walm

   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""bluf"" repeats the color ""green,"" which was directly preceding it.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" changes to ""yellow.""

All examples show that ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color of the word that precedes it. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be determined as follows:

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.",1.0,54,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" I will analyze the examples and look for patterns:

- Every time the word ""bluf"" appears, the output includes two consecutive ""yellow"" colors.
- Additionally, every occurrence of ""bluf"" is followed by the word ""red"" in the output.
- ""bluf"" does not seem to directly translate to a particular color since its presence affects surrounding words and not just the spot it occupies.

Let's consolidate these findings:

1. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the sequence leads to ""green yellow yellow.""
    - This suggests that ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" causes the following color to repeat (""yellow yellow"").

2. When preceded by ""zup,"" ""bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow red.""
    - ""zup"" seems to translate to ""yellow,"" and following the pattern, ""bluf"" causes the following color to be ""red.""

3. If ""wif"" follows ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
    - ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and it appears that ""bluf"" causes this to double.

From these observations, it seems that the rule for ""bluf"" is that it repeats the color of the word that precedes it in the output. However, a closer analysis shows that each time ""bluf"" is used, the output color sequence also dictates a color that has not been specified by the preceding word. For example, when ""zup"" (yellow) precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow red,"" which does not follow the pattern of repetition alone.

Thus, a more nuanced rule is needed. It seems that ""bluf"" both repeats the color of the word before it and adds ""red"" after it, in that order.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the previous word and add ""red"" afterward.",0.9,54,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" represents the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it, each time adding another instance. For example:

    - walm repeats the color word before it (blue) three more times
   Output: green blue blue blue

2. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm

    - zup -> yellow
    - lug -> blue
    - dax -> green
    - zup -> yellow

    - lug -> blue
    - walm repeats the color word before it (blue) three more times
   Output: red blue blue blue

5. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
    - lug -> blue
    - walm repeats the color word before it (blue) three more times
    - wif -> red
    - bluf seems unrelated to the rule for walm; its meaning is not explicitly provided by the examples
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows: 

Rule: walm -> repeats the preceding color word three additional times.",1.0,54,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color associated with the word ""lug,"" which is blue. The number of repetitions is three. The rules can be inferred as follows:

- ""dax"" translates to green.
- ""lug"" translates to blue.
- ""wif"" translates to red.
- ""zup"" translates to yellow.
- ""bluf"" has only appeared once, and given the pattern of other words, it likely translates to blue as well.

Therefore, when ""walm"" is used, it is followed by three instances of blue.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with ""lug"" three times. In the given context, ""lug"" corresponds with blue, thus walm -> blue blue blue.",1.0,54,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce a rule for what ""walm"" means in this context.

1. In the first example, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue"". Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" produces three instances of ""blue"".

2. In the second example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" translates to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"". Again, ""walm"" seems to create additional instances of the color that precedes it, which is ""yellow"" in this case.

3. In the third example, ""dax lug dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue green blue blue blue"". As with the other examples, ""walm"" again seems to replicate the color word that comes before it, ""blue"" in this instance.

4. In the fourth example, ""wif lug walm"" translates to ""red blue blue blue"", reinforcing the earlier observation that ""walm"" multiplies the preceding color, which is ""blue"".

5. In the final example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue"". The word ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue"") and is followed by three instances of ""blue"", but not after the word ""wif;"" hence, ""walm"" does not affect the word ""bluf"" at the end, which likely corresponds to ""blue"".

Given these examples, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it three times.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the previous color three times.",1.0,54,walm

2. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm -> Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""walm"" was followed by three instances of ""yellow.""

3. Input: dax lug dax lug walm -> Output: green blue green blue blue blue

4. Input: wif lug walm -> Output: red blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" was followed by three instances of ""blue.""

5. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   - ""walm"" was followed by one instance of ""blue,"" but then the pattern changed with the introduction of ""wif,"" suggesting ""walm"" only has an effect until another color word appears.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" repeats the color word that immediately precedes it three times, unless another color word appears to interrupt this repetition.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word before ""walm"" three times, unless interrupted by another color word.",0.8,54,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems the word ""walm"" translates to repeating the color associated with the word ""lug"" multiple times. In all cases, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output for ""lug"" is ""blue,"" followed by additional instances of ""blue"" appearing in the output after the word ""walm"" is used.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" there are three instances of ""blue.""

Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
- ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" but ""walm"" comes after two ""zups,"" each of which translates to ""yellow,"" so the output has two additional ""yellow"" after ""blue.""

Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue
- ""Lug"" again translates to ""blue,"" and because ""lug"" is mentioned twice before ""walm,"" there are two additional ""blue"" in the output after ""walm.""

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
- ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" with two additional ""blue"" after ""walm.""

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
- ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" leads to two more ""blue"" before the pattern is interrupted by ""wif"" and returns to ""lug"" with ""blue.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color output of the word ""lug"" (blue) two additional times after the first occurrence.

"Based on the examples provided and their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""wif"". 

Here's the analysis of each example:

1. Input: zup wif bluf zup
   Output: yellow red red yellow
   - 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' at both the beginning and end, and 'bluf' corresponds to 'red'.

2. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   - 'wif' appears to correspond to 'red' since it is the first word in both the input and output. 'bluf' corresponds to double 'blue', as seen from both instances in the input and output.

3. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   - 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' and 'wif' corresponds to 'red'.

4. Input: wif
   Output: red
   - 'wif' on its own corresponds to 'red'.

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - Here 'wif' corresponds to 'red', 'walm' seems to correspond to 'red', 'dax' corresponds to 'green', and 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'.

From these examples, the simplest rule that can be deduced is that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. The presence of the word ""wif"" consistently results in the word ""red"" in the translation, irrespective of its position in the input sentence.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,55,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in each instance it's used. There seems to be no deviation from this pattern, regardless of the words that precede or follow ""wif."" Therefore, the rule that emerges from the examples is straightforward.

"From the provided examples, it's possible to infer the following pattern:

- ""dax"" always results in ""green""
- ""wif"" always results in ""red""
- ""lug"" always results in ""blue""
- ""zup"" has resulted in ""yellow"" twice

Now, considering the output associated with ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and is followed by ""dax"", with the outputs being ""red"" and ""green"", respectively.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output for both is ""green"".
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and both outputs are ""red"".

Given these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it duplicates the output of the word that comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the output color of the preceding word.",1.0,55,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine its output color in each example:

1. dax bluf wif -> green green red
2. dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green
3. wif zup bluf -> red yellow yellow
4. dax bluf -> green green
5. wif bluf lug -> red red blue

Analyzing each occurrence of ""bluf"" with the respective color before it:

1. bluf follows dax and results in green.
2. bluf is preceded by wif (red) and followed by dax (green), resulting in red.
3. bluf follows zup (yellow) and results in yellow.
4. bluf follows dax (green) and results in green again.
5. bluf follows wif (red) and results in red again.

It appears that the word ""bluf"" results in the same color as the word that precedes it. ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the previous word.

Rule:
bluf -> The color that ""bluf"" translates to is the same as the color of the word preceding it.",1.0,55,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

In the first example, ""dax bluf wif"" translates to ""green green red,"" with ""bluf"" taking the color of ""dax,"" which is green.

In the second example, ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue yellow red red green,"" with ""bluf"" taking the color of ""wif,"" which is red.

In the third example, ""wif zup bluf"" translates to ""red yellow yellow,"" with ""bluf"" adopting the color yellow from ""zup.""

In the fourth example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" again with ""bluf"" taking the color green from ""dax.""

In the fifth example, ""wif bluf lug"" translates to ""red red blue,"" with ""bluf"" taking on the color red from ""wif.""

"bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",0.6,55,bluf
"bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red.",0.2,55,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. In every example, the output following ""walm"" is the same color word repeated multiple times, which is the translation of the word before ""walm."" The only variation to this pattern is when ""walm"" is at the end of the input, in which case the color associated with the second-to-last word is repeated three times in the output.

To summarize the observations:

1. Input: lug walm wif bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red red
2. Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
3. Input: lug zup dax walm -> Output: blue yellow green green green
4. Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
5. Input: zup wif walm lug -> Output: yellow red red red blue

In examples 1 and 5, ""walm"" follows ""lug"", and in the output, ""blue"" (associated with ""lug"") is repeated three times, except in example 5 where ""lug"" follows ""walm"" and ""blue"" appears only once at the end. In examples 2 and 4, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and ""dax"", respectively, and in the output, ""red"" (associated with ""wif"") and ""green"" (associated with ""dax"") are repeated three times. Example 3 is the same as 2 and 4, with ""walm"" at the end and ""green"" repeated three times. Example 4 shows that if ""walm"" is the last word in the input, the color corresponding to the second-to-last word is still repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times, or repeated multiple times with a single instance of the initial color if another color word follows.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times, or if ""walm"" is followed by another color word, repeat the previous color multiple times but include a single instance of the following color.",1.0,55,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it three times. The color associations for the other words based on the outputs are as follows:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

So, when ""walm"" follows any of these color-associated words, that color is repeated three times in the output. For example, in the first input ""lug walm wif bluf,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm"" we see ""blue"" repeated three times before the sequence continues with ""wif,"" which corresponds to red. This pattern holds true across all examples.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.",1.0,55,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's look at the relationship between the input and the output in each example:

1. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
Here, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" to ""red"" as well. The word ""walm"" seems to cause the color before it to be repeated three times.

2. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
Here again, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" causes the color before it to be repeated three times.

3. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green
In this case, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The word ""walm"" causes the color before it to be repeated three times.

4. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
Here, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The word ""walm"" causes the color before it to be repeated three times.

5. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
Here again, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" The word ""walm"" has made ""red"" repeat three times before moving on to ""lug.""

Based on these examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> causes the color word before it to be repeated three times in the output.",1.0,55,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color that came just before it. Here is the reasoning:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which has been translated to ""blue."" The output is ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" caused ""blue"" to be repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" The output is ""red red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" caused ""red"" to be repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" which translates to ""green."" The output is ""green green green,"" again indicating that ""walm"" caused the preceding color to be repeated three times.
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""walm"" continues to result in the preceding color being repeated three times (""red red red"" and ""red red red,"" respectively).

Given this pattern, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the sequence, repeat the preceding color three times.",1.0,55,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the input and output pairs to identify patterns:

1. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
2. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
3. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green
4. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
5. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue

From the examples, it seems that each non-walm input word corresponds to a color in the output.

Let's identify the rules for the non-walm words first:
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

Now, for ""walm,"" we observe the following:

In the first example, ""walm"" precedes ""wif"" and the output has three ""blue"" followed by two ""red,"" which corresponds to the inputs ""lug"" (blue) and ""wif"" (red). But since there is only one ""lug"" in the input, ""walm"" must be causing the duplication of ""blue.""

In the second example, ""walm"" precedes ""dax"" and the output has three ""red"" followed by ""green,"" which corresponds to the inputs ""wif"" (red) and ""dax"" (green). Again, only one instance of ""wif"" is in the input, suggesting that ""walm"" causes the duplication of ""red.""

Similarly, in the third example, ""walm"" is at the end, following ""dax."" The output ends with three ""green,"" which implies that ""walm"" may cause the duplication or triplication of the color corresponding to the previous nonce word.

In the fourth and fifth examples, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the color ""red"" repeats thrice in the output, which aligns with ""wif"" being red and the apparent duplication/triplication effect of ""walm.""

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it in the input twice more, leading to a sequence of three colors corresponding to the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to appear three times in total.",0.9,55,walm

"lug -> blue

Rule: Each time the word 'lug' appears, it translates to the word ""blue."" The other words following 'lug' translate to different colors, with 'dax' translating to green, 'zup' to yellow, and 'wif' to red, but 'lug' consistently means blue in each example.",1.0,56,lug
"lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue,"" as it precedes each sequence of color outputs, consistently representing the color blue in each instance.",1.0,56,lug
"lug -> blue. Rule: The term ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue,"" regardless of the context or the other words that accompany it.",1.0,56,lug
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" let's look at the consistent aspect of each output in the presence of ""lug"":

- When ""lug"" is present, the output always starts with ""blue.""
- ""lug"" appears in every input example, paired with different words each time.

Now, let's analyze the remaining portions of the input and corresponding outputs:

1. Input: lug dax
   Output: blue green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. Input: lug zup
   Output: blue yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. Input: lug walm zup
   Output: blue blue blue yellow
   - ""walm zup"" indicates repetition of ""blue"" before the ""yellow"" associated with ""zup.""

4. Input: lug wif dax
   Output: blue red green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" followed by ""green"" which is associated with ""dax.""

Given these observations, the rule for ""lug"" seems to be that it is a prefix that indicates the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> ""blue"" (as a prefix indicating the color blue, with the subsequent word or words indicating additional colors or repetition patterns)",1.0,56,lug
"After analyzing the presented examples, a pattern emerges where each unique word is associated with a color:

- The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"".
- The word ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow"".
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
- The word ""walm"" seems to translate to the color ""green"" each time it appears.

"dax -> green

Rule: The word 'dax' consistently corresponds to the color 'green' irrespective of its position in the input sequence.

"dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Every time ""dax"" appears, the output includes the word ""green.""",1.0,56,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" Here's the reasoning:

- When ""dax"" appears on its own, the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is preceded or followed by different words, it still consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red"" as seen in ""zup wif dax"" and ""dax wif.""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" as seen in ""zup wif dax"" and ""dax zup dax walm"" where it precedes ""wif"" and ""dax"" respectively, yielding ""yellow"" for ""zup.""
- ""walm"" does not have a clearly assigned color, but since it follows ""dax zup dax,"" which would yield ""green yellow green,"" and the entire output is ""green yellow green green green,"" it is reasonable to determine that ""walm"" also translates to ""green.""

Given these observations, the rule appears to be: ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,56,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can infer a pattern for what ""dax"" and the other words represent in terms of colors. Here's the breakdown:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is always ""green.""
- When ""zup"" is present before ""dax,"" ""yellow"" precedes the ""green"" in the output.
- ""Wif"" leads to the output of ""red,"" as seen when it's either before ""dax"" (in the second example) or after it (in the fifth example).
- Lastly, ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""green,"" as seen in the third example, ""dax zup dax walm"" which leads to ""green yellow green green green,"" where the ""green green"" at the end corresponds to ""dax walm.""

Given these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule:
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""zup"" before ""dax"" -> yellow precedes green
- ""wif"" -> red (position appears to be irrelevant to the color it represents)
- ""walm"" -> green",1.0,56,dax

To validate this, I check the consistency of ""wif"" across examples:

- There are no instances where ""wif"" does not correspond to ""red"" in the output.

- In the second input, ""wif"" once again corresponds with ""red.""
- In the third input, each ""wif"" still equals ""red.""
- The fourth input follows the same pattern, with ""wif"" translating to ""red.""
- In the fifth input, ""wif"" on its own also translates to ""red.""

If a pattern in the surrounding words dictated the meaning of ""wif,"" we would likely notice a change in its corresponding output color in at least one of the given examples, but that is not the case. Thus, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of context.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,56,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine where it occurs in each input and the corresponding color in the output.

- When ""lug bluf wif"" occurs, the output is ""blue blue red"".
- When ""lug wif walm"" occurs, the output is ""blue red red red"".
- When ""zup wif"" occurs, the output is ""yellow red"".

The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs provided, no matter the position of ""wif"" in the input sentence or the words surrounding it.

- In the third example, ""wif"" is red, and following ""walm"", ""dax"" which previously corresponded to green now corresponds to red.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm"" it continues to correspond to blue, whereas it would typically correspond to yellow.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""walm,"" ""wif"" which previously corresponded to red now corresponds to green.",1.0,56,walm
"Based on the examples provided and the associated output, we can infer a rule for what ""walm"" means in this context.

In the first example, ""walm"" appears after ""wif walm lug wif,"" with corresponding output ""red red red blue red."" The color red is associated with ""wif,"" but after ""walm,"" it changes the next term, ""lug,"" from blue to red. 

In the second example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" alone in later examples correlates with the color yellow, suggesting ""walm"" may have turned the following non-existent term to yellow as well.

In the third input-output pair, ""wif walm dax zup"" corresponds to ""red red red green yellow."" Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" which usually translates to green. But the color green is delayed until after ""walm,"" and instead, ""red"" is repeated, indicating that ""walm"" may force the repetition of the previous color.

The fourth input-output pair, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" leads to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" suggesting that after ""walm,"" the color changes from yellow to yellow, repeating the color that should normally be associated with ""zup"" before it.

The final example, ""lug dax walm wif,"" translates to ""blue green green green red."" Here, after ""walm,"" the color green is repeated rather than changing to red, which corresponds to ""wif,"" until ""walm's"" effect wears off.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: walm seems to cause the color associated with the previous word to repeat for the next term in the sequence, overriding the normal color association of that next term.

Thus:

walm -> Causes the color associated with the previous word to repeat for the following term.",0.9,56,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" affects the color output of the word that immediately follows it. The color output for the following word is repeated once for each occurrence of ""walm"" before it. Let's examine the examples to see the rule in action:

- In the first example, ""wif walm lug wif,"" ""wif"" normally corresponds to ""red,"" but after ""walm"" the output for ""lug"" is ""red red.""
- In the second example, ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" would output ""yellow,"" but after ""walm,"" it outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" implying that ""walm"" causes the next word's output to repeat three times.
- In the third example, ""wif walm dax zup,"" ""dax"" normally outputs ""green,"" but here it outputs ""red red red,"" thus ""walm"" must have caused the previous color ""red"" to repeat instead of the usual ""green"" for ""dax.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" it results in ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"" where ""lug"" after ""walm"" is outputted three times as ""yellow"" then the color returns to ""blue"" for ""lug.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug dax walm wif,"" ""wif,"" which usually outputs ""red,"" outputs ""green green green"" after ""walm,"" repeating the color of ""dax.""

The rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the next word's color output to repeat for a number of times equal to the count of the previous word's color output. If the previous word has no output, ""walm"" repeats its output thrice by default.

Rule: walm -> causes the color output of the following word to repeat for the number of times equal to the previous color output. If the previous word has no output, repeat thrice.",0.8,56,walm
"Analyzing the examples provided, the role of the word ""walm"" seems to influence the color outcomes of the succeeding word(s). Specifically, ""walm"" appears to cause the following word or words to repeat the color output of the word directly preceding ""walm."" Here is the breakdown based on the examples:

1. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
    - 'wif' outputs red, 'bluf' outputs red, 'dax' outputs green, and after 'walm', 'lug' outputs red (the same as the last word before 'walm')

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
    - 'zup' outputs yellow, and after 'walm', it continues to output yellow (repeating the color of 'zup')

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
    - 'wif' outputs red, and after 'walm', 'dax' outputs red (the same as the last word before 'walm')

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
    - 'lug' outputs blue, 'bluf' outputs blue, 'dax' outputs green, another 'lug' outputs blue, 'zup' outputs yellow, and after 'walm', 'lug' outputs yellow (the same as the last word before 'walm')

5. Input: lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red
    - 'lug' outputs blue, 'dax' outputs green, and after 'walm', 'wif' outputs green (the same as the last word before 'walm')

From these observations, it appears that ""walm"" causes the output color to match that of the word immediately preceding it, for at least one subsequent word and potentially more if no other word is interjected.

"Given the examples, it seems that ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's an analysis of the examples provided:

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" duplicates it.

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green
- Each occurrence of ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the word before it: the second ""dax"" is green, so ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"".

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
- ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" duplicates it.

Input: lug bluf dax bluf
Output: blue blue green green
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""bluf"" duplicates it; likewise for ""dax"" which corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" then duplicates this green.

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow
- Here, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""bluf"" duplicates it.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf duplicates the color of the word that precedes it.",1.0,57,bluf
"Through analysis of the examples, we can discern a pattern for the word ""bluf"" in relation to the words that precede it.

In the first example:
Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and when followed by ""bluf"", ""bluf"" also translates to ""green.""

In the second example:
Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green
The first ""dax"" after ""wif"" corresponds to ""green"", as seen in the first example, and ""bluf"" following this ""dax"" also results in ""green"". Here, ""bluf"" maintains its correspondence to the word that comes right before it, ""dax"", which is translated as ""green"".

In the third example:
Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" following this ""wif"" also results in ""red"". Again, ""bluf"" takes the same output value as the word before it.

In the fourth example:
Input: lug bluf dax bluf
Output: blue blue green green
The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" following ""lug"" results in ""blue"". The word ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and the next ""bluf"" also translates to ""green"", further supporting the observed pattern.

In the fifth example:
Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow
The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow"".

From these examples, we can induce that ""bluf"" takes on the color that is associated with the immediately preceding word.

Rule:
bluf -> the same output as the word immediately before it in the sequence.",1.0,57,bluf
"From the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" requires looking at the word immediately preceding it to determine the output. Let's discern the rule based on each example.

1. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   - The word before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green,"" so ""bluf"" might repeat the color associated with the word before it.

2. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green
   - The sequence ""dax bluf"" is at the end. ""Dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and ""bluf"" results in another green.

3. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - ""Wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" again repeats the color associated with the word before it, ""red.""

4. Input: lug bluf dax bluf
   Output: blue blue green green
   - ""Lug"" translates to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" repeats the color ""blue."" For ""dax bluf,"" it repeats ""green.""

5. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   - The word before ""bluf"" is ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" gives ""yellow"" once again.

From these examples, we can deduce the rule that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,57,bluf
"Observing the examples, we can see a pattern emerge that relates to the presence of the word ""bluf"" and its output. The outputs are sequences of color words.

- When ""bluf"" follows the word ""dax,"" the output is ""green green."" 
- When ""bluf"" follows the word ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows the word ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue."" 
- The word ""zup"" before ""bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow.""

It seems that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word. In the examples where ""bluf"" immediately follows, the color of the previous word is doubled in the output.

Based on this pattern, we could say that the rule is: ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the directly preceding word to be repeated in the output sequence. If there's no specific color linked with the preceding word (as in the last example ""dax zup bluf""), it seems to default to ""yellow"" for some reason, but without further context or additional examples, stating a definitive rule for this case is difficult.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color linked to the word immediately before it in the output.",0.9,57,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be directly dependent on the word that precedes it. Specifically, it seems to repeat the output color associated with the word right before it.

- In the first example, ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the output is ""green green"", indicating that ""bluf"" takes the color associated with ""dax"" which is green.
- In the second example, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"", again repeating the color associated with ""dax"".
- In the third example, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"", so ""bluf"" takes the color of ""wif"", which is red.
- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf dax bluf"" results in ""blue blue green green"". The first ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and repeats its color, blue. The second ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and repeats its color, green.
- In the fifth example, ""dax zup bluf"" results in ""green yellow yellow"", which seems a bit irregular compared to the other patterns, but it could be reasoned that ""bluf"" is repeating the color of ""zup"" (yellow) since it immediately follows it.

Given these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it repeats the color output associated with the immediately preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color output of the word immediately before it.",0.8,57,bluf
"Looking at each instance of ""walm"" in the inputs and their respective outputs, we can attempt to identify a pattern for the word ""walm.""

Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
- Here, ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" which appears to correspond to ""yellow."" We observe a repetition of ""yellow"" three times in the output.

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- In this sequence, ""walm"" again follows ""zup"" and the corresponding output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" consistent with the first example. It does not seem affected by the presence of ""bluf"" (blue) and ""lug.""

Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
- ""Walm"" follows ""dax,"" which seems to represent ""green,"" observed in the output as three repetitions of ""green.""

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm -> Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""Walm"" appears twice, first after ""wif,"" translating to ""red red red,"" and then following a ""zup,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which follows the recognized pattern.

Input: zup wif walm lug -> Output: yellow red red red blue
- In this context, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which seems to be associated with ""red,"" and the pattern of three repetitions is consistent.

From these examples, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the word directly preceding it to be repeated three times in the output color. Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" seems to be ""repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,57,walm
"After evaluating the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of a color. Specifically, the color is repeated three times. Each occurrence of ""walm"" is preceded by a different word that has a corresponding color output:

- ""zup"" leads to the color output ""yellow""
- ""dax"" leads to the color output ""green""
- ""wif"" leads to the color output ""red""

Regardless of what follows ""walm"" or what precedes it, the word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times.

So the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,57,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color tied to the preceding word. Each word preceding ""walm"" is associated with a specific color, and when ""walm"" follows that word, the output is the color associated with the preceding word repeated three times.

- ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow."" This indicates that ""zup"" stands for the color ""yellow.""
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" which suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" showing that ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,57,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. Here's the breakdown of the rule application from the examples:

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" with ""zup"" associated with ""yellow.""
- ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" with ""zup"" still associated with ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" with blue (once, as it's not followed by ""walm"").
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" with ""dax"" associated with ""green.""
- ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" results in ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" with ""wif"" associated with ""red"" and ""zup"" again associated with ""yellow.""
- ""zup wif walm lug"" results in ""yellow red red red blue,"" with ""zup"" first associated with ""yellow,"" then ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" gives ""red red red.""

"Rule: The word ""walm"" translates to repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"" because ""dax"" stands for ""green,"" so ""walm"" means repeating ""green"" three times.

Thus, the rule is as follows:

"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"". Across all examples, whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output. There is no contextual variation or other contributing factors indicated by the examples provided.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,58,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

The examples indicate that whenever the word ""dax"" is presented in the input, the word ""green"" is part of the corresponding output sequence. Each occurrence of ""dax"" directly translates to ""green"", regardless of its position or the context within the sentence.",1.0,58,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we cannot deduce the specific meaning of ""dax"" when it stands alone because there is no singular instance where ""dax"" is not accompanied by other words which also correlate to specific colors in the output. However, we can infer that whenever ""dax"" is present, the color ""green"" appears in the output.

Here are the observations:

- In examples 1 and 2, ""dax lug"" consistently translates to ""green blue"".
- In example 3, ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"" (ignoring ""wif"" which acts like a separator) and the output is ""green green"".
- Example 4 features ""dax"" both at the beginning and end of the input sequence, each time corresponding to ""green"" in the output, irrespective of the words in between.
- Example 5 continues to support the pattern, as ""dax"" translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

From these observations, we can reasonably infer that ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green"". However, we must note that there's a consistent relationship between other words and colors, which also affects the placement of ""green"" in the output, but the presence of ""dax"" always results in ""green"" appearing somewhere in the corresponding output.

Thus, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: ""dax"" -> ""green""",1.0,58,dax
"Based on the provided examples, one can observe that the output always contains the color ""green"" whenever the input contains the word ""dax."" No matter the position of ""dax"" in the input string or the presence of other words, ""green"" is consistently in the output when ""dax"" is in the input.

Considering this information, here is the deduction:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,58,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following:

- ""wif"" always generates an output of ""red red red""
- Each instance of a unique non-""wif"" word corresponds to a unique color in the sequence

From the first example:
- ""wif walm zup walm"" corresponds to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow""
  This indicates ""wif"" is ""red red red"" and ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""walm"" is repeated.

From the second example:
- ""wif walm"" corresponding to ""red red red"" reaffirms that ""wif"" is ""red red red"".

From the third example:
- ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red green blue"". We know ""wif"" is ""red"", so ""zup"" is likely ""yellow"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""lug"" is ""blue"". ""Bluf"" doesn't seem to correspond to a color here, but since ""bluf"" occurs only once and each word corresponds to a pair or trio of colors, it could be an error or it's a non-contributing word in this sequence.

From the fourth example:
- ""dax wif zup dax"" corresponds to ""green red yellow green"", which supports the color associations for ""dax,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup"".

From the fifth example:
- ""wif lug zup bluf"" corresponds to ""red blue yellow yellow"". ""Wif"" is ""red"" and ""lug"" is ""blue"" after ""wif"". Since ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", it seems ""bluf"" could be contributing to the ""yellow"" after ""zup"", suggesting that ""bluf"" and ""zup"" together correspond to ""yellow yellow"".

Piecing this together, the meaning associated with ""wif"" doesn't depend on context but is a fixed output signal. Therefore, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red red red",1.0,58,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,58,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red."" Each instance of ""wif"" produces an output of ""red red red,"" which suggests that ""wif"" translates to the color red repeated three times. 

The rule, therefore, seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red red red",1.0,58,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

The examples demonstrate that whenever the nonce word ""wif"" is used in the input, the output consistently includes three reds in succession. There is no variation in the number or color representation of the output related to ""wif,"" suggesting that ""wif"" definitively translates to ""red red red.""",1.0,58,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to a specific color associated with it in the output. Each input that contains ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output sequence. Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Rule:

zup -> yellow",1.0,58,zup
"Examining the provided examples, let's look at the relationship between the input and the output:

- In the first example, 'dax' corresponds to 'green,' 'wif' to 'red,' 'bluf' to 'yellow,' and hence 'zup' must map to 'yellow' as well.
- In the second example, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue,' 'dax' to 'green,' so 'zup' again maps to 'yellow.'
- In the third example, we can confirm the previous mappings of 'dax,' 'wif,' and 'bluf' to 'green,' 'red,' and 'yellow' respectively, so 'zup' continues to correspond to 'yellow.'
- The fourth example reinforces the mapping of 'lug' to 'blue' and supports the previous instances of 'zup' mapping to 'yellow.'
- Lastly, the fifth example continues to support the mapping of 'dax' to 'green' and 'wif' to 'red,' with ‘zup’ mapping to 'yellow'.

Based on the above observations, every instance of 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow.' There is no indication that 'zup' changes meaning based on position, other words, or context within these examples. Therefore, we can deduce that 'zup' consistently maps to the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,58,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce that each unique word corresponds to a unique color. ""Dax"" always corresponds to green, ""wif"" to red, ""bluf"" to yellow, and ""lug"" to blue. 

When looking at the word ""zup,"" it appears in various contexts but consistently outputs the color yellow. However, we need to verify that ""zup"" is not context-dependent and that it always corresponds to yellow. 

Reviewing the examples:

- In the first and third examples, it seems like ""zup"" may just be the color yellow as it's the only word that maps to yellow in those strings.
- In the second example, ""zup lug dax"" translates to ""yellow blue green,"" and since we know that ""lug"" is blue and ""dax"" is green from the other examples, ""zup"" would then correspond to yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" appears twice and both instances correspond to yellow, strengthening the hypothesis that ""zup"" maps to yellow regardless of its position.
- In the fifth example, ""dax zup wif"" translates to ""green yellow red,"" confirming the patterns observed in previous examples.

Reviewing all the input and output sets, it's clear that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow, and there are no instances where ""zup"" maps to any color other than yellow.

Looking at the first example:

- ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""green red yellow yellow red red red.""

Here we see that ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Therefore, the word ""bluf"" coincides with the transition to repeating the color that just appeared.

Continuing with the other examples:

- ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" translates to ""blue green green red green.""

Again, the word ""bluf"" precedes a repetition of ""green.""

- ""wif walm lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue.""

The word ""bluf"" is followed by a repetition of ""blue.""

- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow.""

The word ""bluf"" is followed by a repeat of the yellow color.

- ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue.""

Again, ""bluf"" precedes a repeated color; this time it's ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before ""bluf.""

Hence, ""bluf"" causes the following color to be a repeat of the color directly preceding it.",1.0,58,bluf
"Given the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a repetition of the immediately preceding color. 

- In the first example, the word preceding ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" In the output, ""bluf"" is also translated into ""yellow."" 
- In the second example, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" and ""bluf"" again results in ""green"" in the output.
- The third and fourth examples follow the same pattern and thus further consolidate the rule.

So, based on these observations, the rule for the word ""bluf"" can be described as follows:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it.",1.0,58,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we will identify the pattern associated with the use of the nonce word ""bluf"" and formulate a rule.

Example 1:
Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

Example 2:
Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
Output: blue green green red green

Example 3:
Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue

Example 4:
Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Example 5:
Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

For all inputs, the occurrence of ""bluf"" is immediately followed by a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word:
- In Example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which maps to ""yellow,"" and the output is ""yellow"" after ""bluf.""
- In Example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which maps to ""green,"" and the output is ""green"" after ""bluf.""
- In Example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which maps to ""red,"" and the output is ""red"" twice after ""bluf,"" meaning it could be doubling the previous color.
- In Example 4, ""bluf"" again follows ""zup"" which maps to ""yellow,"" and the output is yellow again.
- In Example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which maps to ""yellow,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated in the output.

Rule:
From the given examples, we can infer that ""bluf"" -> repeats the color associated with the previous word. If the previous word's associated color output is not yet present or is the first occurrence, it seems to simply repeat the color of the previous word once, otherwise, it could potentially double the color output. However, the provided examples are insufficient to conclusively determine if doubling the output for previously occurred colors is consistent because there’s no example where ""bluf"" is preceded by a first occurrence word that is not at the start of the sequence.",0.9,58,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to represent a repeating sequence of previous colors in reverse order. We can determine this by analyzing the patterns in which ""bluf"" appears and the resulting color sequences:

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
- ""bluf"" produces ""yellow red,"" which is the reverse of the colors that appear immediately before it (red yellow).

Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
Output: blue green green red green
- ""bluf"" causes the reversal of the colors ""green blue,"" resulting in ""green red"" in the output.

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue
- ""bluf"" inverts the colors ""red red"" to ""blue blue.""

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
- ""bluf"" duplicates the color ""yellow"" from before it, which, since it's a single color, can also be seen as an inversion (as reversing a single-element sequence results in the same sequence).

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
- Here, ""bluf"" again demonstrates the rule by repeating the sequence ""yellow blue yellow"" in reverse, which results in ""yellow yellow blue.""

Rule:
bluf -> meaning: bluf means to take the sequence of colors before it and repeat them in reverse order. If there's only one color before it, ""bluf"" simply repeats that color.",0.8,58,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be the following:

Whenever ""bluf"" occurs in the input, the output is the repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".

The rule induction based on the examples can be:

1. In the first example, ""wif"" which corresponds to red, is immediately before ""bluf"", therefore, the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow yellow"" which is the repeated color associated with the preceding word ""zup"".

2. In the second example, ""dax"" which corresponds to green, precedes ""bluf"", making the output for ""bluf"" ""green red"", repeating the color for ""dax"".

3. In the third example, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"", which means ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue"" in the output, repeating the color for ""lug"".

4. In the fourth example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", making the output for ""bluf"" ""yellow"" repeated once.

5. In the last example, ""zup"" again precedes ""bluf"", which means ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow"" in the output, repeating the color for ""zup"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word.",0.0,58,bluf
"From the examples provided, ""walm"" appears to function as a word that repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it. Here's how this interpretation plays out across the given examples:

1. In ""lug walm wif,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" immediately follows it, thus resulting in another ""blue."" Then ""wif"" is ""red.""
   Output: blue blue blue red

2. In ""wif lug walm,"" ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue"" and is immediately followed by ""walm,"" which leads to another ""blue."" ""Wif"" is ""red"" at either beginning or end because the pattern remains consistent, regardless of position.
   Output: red blue blue blue

3. In ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" followed by ""walm,"" which repeats the color of ""wif.""
   Output: red red red

4. In ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" each ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" follows the ""wif"" here which is ""red,"" so ""walm"" repeats the color ""red."" ""Bluf,"" which is unfamiliar based on the previous patterns, can be deduced to correspond to ""blue"" as it precedes a ""wif"" leading to ""red.""
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

5. In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" follows it, thereby repeating the color ""blue.""
   Output: blue blue blue

Based on this information, we can construct the following rule:

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,58,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let us examine the provided examples and look for patterns concerning the position of ""walm"" and its corresponding output.

In all instances where ""walm"" is used, it seems to be associated with three consecutive words of the same color output. There is also a consistent correspondence between different words (""lug"" and ""wif"") and outputs (""blue"" and ""red""). Let's try to break it down:

- We can see ""lug"" appears to correspond to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" appears to correspond to ""red."" This can be confirmed as ""lug"" always precedes ""blue"" and ""wif"" always precedes ""red.""

- Now, looking at the examples with ""walm,"" it seems that ""walm"" is followed by three identical colors that are dependent on the word preceding it: 
    - In example 1, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word just before it three times.
    - The same happens with ""wif walm"" in example 3, this time repeating ""red"" three times.
    - In example 4, after ""lug,"" it is followed by ""blue"" three times, again consistent with the word prior.
    - Example 2 has ""walm"" at the end, and it follows the pattern of the word before it, repeating ""blue"" three times.
    - Example 5, being ""lug walm,"" repeats ""blue"" three times.

Based on this consistency in the pattern, we can surmise that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the word directly before it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,58,walm
"From the given examples, it looks like the nonce word ""walm"" refers to a color rule based on the proceeding word. Here's what can be deduced:

- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" it outputs ""blue blue blue.""
- When preceded by ""wif,"" it outputs ""red red red.""
- ""Walm"" by itself has not been demonstrated, so we can't deduce what it would output on its own.

Given these examples, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word just before it, three times. The rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes the color associated with the previous word and repeats that color output three times. If the word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" the associated color seems to be blue. If the word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" the associated color is red.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.",0.9,58,walm
"Based on the examples given, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
2. ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""

Examining the instances where ""walm"" appears, we notice:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" the output is an additional ""blue"" followed by a ""red"" at the end.
- When ""walm"" appears on its own after ""wif,"" the output is continuous ""red.""
- ""walm"" never appears without a preceding ""lug"" or ""wif.""

From this, we can hypothesize that ""walm"" continues the color pattern established by the preceding word until the sequence is broken by another word:

- If ""lug"" (blue) proceeds ""walm,"" it continues the ""blue"" sequence until the end of the sequence, where it adds a ""red.""
- If ""wif"" (red) proceeds ""walm,"" it continues the ""red"" sequence.

Rule:
walm -> when following ""lug,"" it means repeat the color ""blue"" (initiated by ""lug"") and end with ""red""; when following ""wif,"" it means continue with the color ""red"" (initiated by ""wif"").",0.9,58,walm
"To determine what ""walm"" means, we should look for patterns in the inputs and outputs. Let's examine the input and output pairs:

1. Input: ""lug walm wif"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue red""
2. Input: ""wif lug walm"" -> Output: ""red blue blue blue""
3. Input: ""wif walm"" -> Output: ""red red red""
4. Input: ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" -> Output: ""blue blue red blue red red red blue""
5. Input: ""lug walm"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue""

From the above inputs and outputs, we can deduce that:

- ""lug"" seems to be reliably associated with ""blue"".
- ""wif"" seems to be reliably associated with ""red"".
- ""walm"" appears to change its associated color based on its position or context.

Now, let's try to deduce the rule for ""walm"" based on the outputs:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue blue blue"", which suggests that ""walm"" in this context might mean ""blue"".
2. When ""walm"" is at the end and follows ""wif lug"", the output is ""red blue blue blue"", which suggests that ""walm"" in this case might mean ""blue"".
3. When ""walm"" follows only ""wif"", without ""lug"" preceding it, the output is ""red red red"", which suggests that ""walm"" in this context might mean ""red"".
4. When ""walm"" follows ""lug wif"", the output is mixed, but the color ""red"" seems to be resulting from ""wif"", and where ""walm"" is directly preceded by ""lug"", the color is ""blue""; after ""wif"" but within that sequence, ""walm"" leads to ""red"".

Considering the variability and comparison with inputs and outputs, we can propose a rule for the meaning of ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" takes the color of the immediately preceding word. If ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""blue"". If ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""red"".

Thus:
walm -> meaning: Walm takes on the color associated with the word immediately preceding it in the sequence. If it is preceded by ""lug"", it means ""blue"", and if preceded by ""wif"", it means ""red"".",0.9,58,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.",1.0,59,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,59,lug
"lug -> meaning. The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue.

Rule: lug means blue.",1.0,59,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in every example provided.",1.0,59,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position in the sequence or the context in which it appears.",1.0,59,lug
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we can identify patterns from the given input-output pairs. We'll compare the positions and occurrences of ""dax"" in the input sentences with the matching colors in the output sequences:

1. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green yellow blue green
2. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
3. dax wif walm -> green red red red
4. dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue
5. zup wif dax -> yellow red green

Based on the inputs and outputs, we can observe the following:

- Every time the input begins with ""dax,"" the output begins with green. 
- Whenever ""dax"" is directly followed by ""walm,"" we see a sequence of two green colors in the output, suggesting a rule where ""dax walm"" together translates to a two-fold ""green.""
- ""dax"" is green irrespective of position; it's green when it starts the input, ends the input, or is in the middle.
- The word that follows ""dax"" affects the color that comes after green if it's not ""walm"" (e.g., ""wif"" after ""dax"" leads to ""green red"").

Let's formulate a rule. Considering that ""dax"" consistently translates to green regardless of its position and the influence of the following word on the subsequent color, we can deduce that:

Rule: ""dax"" translates to ""green"" but also has an effect on the following word's color output based on an undetermined set of rules.",1.0,59,dax
"Observing the examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" has an associated color output, which is ""green"", because every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, a ""green"" follows in the output. There's no additional context on what ""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" or ""zup"" stand for in terms of color, but for ""dax,"" it consistently maps to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,59,dax
"Given the examples, it is possible to identify a pattern for what the nonce word ""dax"" might represent. To find the rule, I will assess the consistency of ""dax"" in the input and the corresponding output:

- In all examples where ""dax"" is present, the immediate output following ""dax"" is always ""green.""
- The word ""dax"" can be at the beginning, middle, or end of the input. Regardless of its position, the following outputs are always ""green"" for the number of times ""dax"" appears.

The simplest rule that fits these observations is:

Rule:
dax -> green

This means that the presence of the word ""dax"" in the input consistently results in the word ""green"" in the output.",1.0,59,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the color output for ""dax"" consistently corresponds to green. This is irrespective of its position in the input string. Each instance of ""dax"" maps to ""green"" in the output, regardless of which other words appear before or after it.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,59,dax
"From the given examples, it appears that the outputs are sequences of colors associated with the input words. The word ""dax"" shows up in every input, and every output sequence starts with ""green."" No other input word consistently produces the same color in the output. Thus, it can be inferred that the word ""dax"" is associated with the color green.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,59,dax
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,59,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,59,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,59,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,59,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,59,wif
Rule: zup -> yellow.,1.0,59,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.",1.0,59,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color yellow regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,59,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to the output ""yellow.""",1.0,59,zup
"Based on the examples provided, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the list or the words that accompany it. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is quite straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,59,zup
"bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position within the input sequence.",1.0,59,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> blue. When ""bluf"" is preceded by a color word, it repeats that color word. When it follows a color word without another intervening ""bluf,"" it retains the meaning of that color word. When two ""blufs"" follow each other directly or are separated by color words, they both take on the meaning of the preceding color word.",1.0,59,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Based on the examples, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to the word ""blue"" with the following observed pattern:

- If ""bluf"" follows the word ""lug"", the output is ""blue blue"".
- If ""bluf"" does not immediately follow ""lug"", it translates to ""blue"".
  
Rule: The output for ""bluf"" is ""blue"", and it duplicates the word ""blue"" if it immediately follows the word ""lug"".",1.0,59,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the word ""blue,"" but when directly following the words ""lug"" or ""wif"" it repeats the color that ""lug"" or ""wif"" translate to before becoming ""blue."" When it comes after ""zup,"" it just translates to ""blue.""",1.0,59,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" means ""blue"". However, it is repeated as many times as the color word preceding it. If the preceding color word is ""lug,"" then ""bluf"" is written twice as ""blue blue."" If ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" or ""zup,"" it's written once as just ""blue.""",0.8,59,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color immediately preceding it. Here are the rules that support this deduction:

- In the first example, ""wif lug zup"" translates to ""red blue yellow"", and then ""walm"" is followed by ""wif lug"", resulting in a repeated ""yellow"" for every ""walm"" before the ""wif lug"" sequence resumes with ""red blue"".
- In the second example, ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue"", and ""walm"" follows, causing a repetition of ""blue"" three times.
- In the third example, ""dax lug"" translates to ""green blue"", followed by ""walm"", which again results in a repetition of ""blue"" three times.
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", followed by ""walm"" that results in ""yellow"" being repeated two times, and then ""dax lug"" follows and translates to ""green blue"".
- The last example just has ""zup walm"", translating to ""yellow"" followed by ""walm"" repeating ""yellow"" two more times.

Given these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Replicate the color word that precedes it three times.",1.0,59,walm
"After analyzing the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color that comes before it until a new color is indicated by another word. 

For instance, in the first example, the color before ""walm"" is ""yellow,"" indicated by the word ""zup,"" and it is repeated until a new color, ""red"" indicated by the word ""wif,"" appears. Similarly, in the second example, the appearance of ""walm"" after ""zup"" (yellow) and ""lug"" (blue) results in a repetition of blue until the end of the sequence. This pattern holds true across all the provided examples.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last mentioned color until a new color is introduced.",1.0,59,walm
"Observing the given examples, we can deduce the following correlations:

- The color associated with ""lug"" is consistently ""blue.""
- The other words ""wif"", ""zup"", and ""dax"" correlate with ""red"", ""yellow"", and ""green"" respectively.

Now, let's focus on the input containing ""walm"":

- When ""walm"" is included after other words (like ""wif"", ""zup"", or ""dax"") as in the first three examples, it seems to repeat the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it. For example, in the first input ""wif lug zup walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and after ""walm"" we see ""yellow"" repeated. Similarly, in the third input ""dax lug walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and after ""walm"" we see ""green"" repeated.
- In the last two examples, where ""walm"" appears with ""zup"" but without a following word, ""yellow"" is repeated three times. This matches the pattern we've observed where ""walm"" repeats the color of the word just before it two additional times (for a total of three times including the original instance).

Based on this, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color output of the word immediately preceding it three times in total (including the original instance of the color). If ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"", the output is ""yellow"" three times; if by ""dax"", then ""green"" three times; and if by ""wif"", then ""red"" three times. If ""walm"" comes after ""lug"", it seems to consider the word before ""lug"" to decide the color to repeat.",1.0,59,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" causes the color before it to be repeated three times. In every instance where ""walm"" is used, the color that comes just before ""walm"" is outputted three times. 

For example:
- In ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and right after ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- In ""zup lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and after ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- In ""dax lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and after ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- In ""zup walm dax lug"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and right after ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated three times before moving on to ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"".
- In ""zup walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and after ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color word before it to be repeated three times.",1.0,59,walm
"Based on the examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat itself according to the previous color mentioned. Let's look at the instances:

1. ""wif lug zup walm"" translates to ""red blue yellow yellow yellow"". After ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", the ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat twice more.

2. ""zup lug walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue"". After ""lug"" which is ""blue"", the ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to repeat three times.

3. ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue"". After ""lug"" which is ""blue"", the ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to repeat three times.

4. ""zup walm dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue"". Here, ""walm"" after ""zup"" (which is ""yellow"") causes ""yellow"" to repeat two more times before moving onto ""dax"" and ""lug"" which produce ""green"" and ""blue"" respectively.

5. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"". The ""walm"" after ""zup"" (which is ""yellow"") causes ""yellow"" to repeat two more times.

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the last mentioned color to repeat three times total. If there is no color mentioned before ""walm"" (not applicable in given examples), we cannot deduce from the current data what the output would be.

Therefore:

walm -> The last mentioned color is repeated two more times, making three appearances in total.",0.9,59,walm
"From the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of ""lug"" by looking at its consistency across different inputs:

- Whenever ""lug"" appears alone, the output is ""blue"".
- When ""lug"" appears with ""bluf"", which by itself corresponds to ""red"", the output is ""blue blue"", which suggests ""lug"" still corresponds to ""blue"".
- In a more complex input such as ""wif dax lug walm"", we see that ""lug"" is followed by three instances of ""blue"" in the output, suggesting that it might contribute a single ""blue"" to the output sequence regardless of what follows it.

Based on this analysis, the rule seems to be:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,60,lug
"lug -> blue

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its positioning in the input sequence.

- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""zup lug"" consistently maps to ""yellow blue"". The word ""zup"" once more maps to ""yellow"".

Thus, we can deduce the rule:

zup -> yellow. Meaning: When the input contains ""zup"", the corresponding output color is ""yellow"".",1.0,60,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can see that regardless of what other words are present, the output always contains ""yellow"" when the word ""zup"" is in the input. There are no counterexamples provided that show ""zup"" leading to any output other than ""yellow."" Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The presence of the word ""zup"" in the input corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,60,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Regardless of context or position in the input sequence, whenever ""zup"" appears, the output includes the color ""yellow.""",1.0,60,zup
"Rule: bluf -> yellow when following zup, green when following dax, blue when following lug.",1.0,60,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeat the previous color.,1.0,60,bluf
"The examples seem to indicate that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word immediately preceding it. To put it into a rule:

Rule: bluf -> the color value of the preceding word.",1.0,60,bluf
"Rule: bluf translates to the color that follows the last word before bluf in the sequence. If bluf is the first word or there is no previous color word, it defaults to yellow.

- In the first example, ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup,"" bluf follows zup, which corresponds to yellow, so bluf is yellow.
- In the second example, ""dax zup bluf,"" bluf follows zup, which corresponds to yellow, so bluf is yellow.
- In the third example, ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" the first bluf follows zup, which corresponds to yellow, so the first bluf is yellow, and the second instance of bluf isn't present, but if it were to follow lug, it would be blue.
- In the fourth example, ""dax bluf zup bluf dax,"" the first bluf follows dax, which corresponds to green, so the first bluf is green, and the second bluf follows zup, which corresponds to yellow, so the second bluf is yellow.
- In the fifth example, ""lug bluf zup,"" bluf follows lug, which corresponds to blue, so bluf is blue.",1.0,60,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the correspondence between the input and output across the different examples:

1. ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""
2. ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""
3. ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue.""
4. ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the only instance it appears.

Now, let's look at the context in which ""bluf"" appears:

- In examples where ""bluf"" directly follows ""zup"" or ""dax,"" the output color is the same as the color assigned to ""zup"" or ""dax"" (yellow or green, respectively). Specifically:
  - ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow""
  - ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green""
- In the example ""lug bluf zup,"" ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and corresponds to ""blue"" (the same color as the one assigned to ""lug"") in the output.

From these observations, we can induce that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it. So, if ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" then ""zup bluf"" is ""yellow yellow."" If ""dax"" is ""green,"" then ""dax bluf"" is ""green green,"" and if ""lug"" is ""blue,"" then ""lug bluf"" is ""blue blue.""

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",1.0,60,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let us look at each occurrence of the word and the corresponding output:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   
2. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   
3. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   
4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
5. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Observing the patterns, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it three times. Each word seems to have a color associated with it:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

Thus, when ""walm"" follows any of these words, the output repeats the color of that word three times. Additionally, ""walm"" does not seem to have an associated color of its own, as no new color is introduced after its triplet. Instead, it possibly serves as a repeating mechanism for the previous color, and after ""walm"" has exerted its effect, the pattern continues with the next color word's corresponding color.

Rule: walm -> repeats the output color of the preceding word three times",1.0,60,walm
"From the provided examples, the pattern suggests that the word ""walm"" is associated with the output of a sequence of three colors corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" The color sequence repeats the color that represents the preceding word. The pattern can be summarized as follows:

- ""wif"" leads to the output ""red,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" results in ""red red red.""
- ""lug"" leads to the output ""blue,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" results in ""blue blue blue.""
- ""dax"" leads to the output ""green,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" results in ""green green green.""

Based on the last input, where ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it is reasonable to infer that ""zup"" would output ""yellow,"" and thus ""walm"" following it outputs ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Therefore, ""walm"" indicates a rule that repeats the color corresponding to the previous word three times in sequence. 

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,60,walm
"To figure out what the nonce word ""walm"" means, let's look at the patterns before and after ""walm"" appears, along with the output.

1. ""wif walm dax"" outputs ""red red red green""
   - Here, ""wif"" might correspond to ""red"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", based on the output.

2. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue blue red blue blue""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". ""walm"" appears between ""lug"" and ""wif"" in both the input and output, and a pattern of three blues is observed before ""red"", suggesting ""walm"" triggers a repetition.

3. ""dax walm wif"" outputs ""green green green red""
   - Just like before, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and following ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated until ""wif"" changes it to ""red"".

4. ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue""
   - With ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"", it seems like ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""blue"" with no color change since another color-word is not provided.

5. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" outputs ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and it seems ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""zup"", resulting in ""red"" being repeated. ""walm"" at the end repeats ""yellow"".

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color word before it to be repeated until a new color word changes the sequence. If no new color word is introduced, the repetition continues until the end of the sequence.

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeater. ""Walm"" makes the color indicated by the word before it repeat until a new color word appears. If no new color word appears, the repetition continues until the end.",1.0,60,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe that the nonce word ""walm"" seems to influence the output in a consistent manner:

- Whenever ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red green.""
- Whenever ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" the subsequent word (""dax"" in the third example) results in ""green"" which happens to be the same as ""dax"" by itself.
- In the example where ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is two instances of ""yellow.""

We can attempt to derive meaning from ""walm"" by looking for patterns in the examples where it's used:

- ""wif walm"" consistently leads to ""red red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" may inherit or extend the color associated with the word it follows. The additional color ""green"" seems independent of ""walm,"" as ""wif"" on its own does not correspond to ""green.""
- Similarly, ""lug walm"" consistently leads to ""blue blue blue,"" following the pattern where ""walm"" extends the output color of the preceding word.
- The instance of ""zup walm"" does not strictly follow this pattern since it leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" but we don't have a stand-alone ""zup"" for reference. Moreover, ""walm"" here is in the middle of the inputs and not followed by another color-word, suggesting ""walm"" might be extending any preceding color-word.

From these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color output of the previously mentioned color-word three times. When ""walm"" is the last word or is not followed by another color-word, it will only repeat the color-related to the preceding word three times. When ""walm"" is followed by a color-word, it extends the output of that color-word once, and the following color-word determines the final color in the output.

Rule: walm -> ""walm"" causes the next word's color to appear once and repeats the previous color three times. If there's no subsequent color-word, only the previous color repeats three times.",0.9,60,walm
"Looking at the given inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can try to deduce the pattern that will give us the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

1. In the first example, ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green."" Since both ""wif"" and ""dax"" are resulting in ""red"" and ""green"" respectively in different contexts, it seems that ""walm"" repeated ""red"" before it turned to green, suggesting that ""walm"" might be acting as a repeat function for the previous color or word before changing to a different color.

2. In the second example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" gives us ""blue blue blue red blue blue,"" wherein ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" into ""red,"" and ""bluf"" is unchanged, suggesting ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue."" ""walm"" again seems to repeat the color of ""lug"" twice before turning to ""red"" when encountering ""wif.""

3. The third example, ""dax walm wif,"" translates to ""green green green red."" Here, ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" The ""walm"" is again repeating the color of ""dax"" twice before changing to ""red"" for ""wif.""

4. The fourth example, ""lug walm,"" gives us ""blue blue blue,"" and since ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""walm"" is repeating ""blue"" twice.

5. In the final example, ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" the output is ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" So ""walm"" repeated the ""red"" color from ""wif"" two additional times before encountering ""zup,"" to which it translates to ""yellow."" Afterwards, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and when followed by ""zup walm,"" ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times.

It seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word prior to it. If the word is changed after ""walm,"" it appears as if ""walm"" repeats the last color two more times before taking on the new color word. However, the last example deviates from this pattern, with ""walm"" repeating ""yellow"" three times instead of two after a new color (""blue"") has been introduced.

Taking all these into account, a possible rule could be:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word multiple times before taking the color of the next distinct color word.

However, due to the deviation in the last example, there may be an additional or alternative rule not completely evident from the provided examples, or there could be an inconsistency in the data. Based on the given information, we can only approximate the meaning of ""walm.""

Here, ""wif"" appears before ""walm,"" which translates to a sequence of ""red"" repeated three times following it.

- In examples 1, 3, 4, and 5, immediately following a ""zup,"" the output has the color ""yellow.""
- Example 2 is slightly different because ""zup"" is preceded and followed by other nonce words. However, ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.

5. Input: lug wif walm -> Output: blue red red red

Now let's look for consistencies concerning ""walm"":

1. When ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" the color green follows ""dax,"" and subsequent colors are green until a new word appears.
2. When ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" the color is blue, and subsequent colors are red until a new word appears.
3. When ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" the color is red, and subsequent colors are red until a new word appears.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" represents the color immediately preceding it in the sequence. More precisely, whatever the color output is for the word right before ""walm"" is repeated for ""walm"".

1. lug dax **walm** wif -> blue green **green** red
2. wif zup lug dax zup **walm** -> red yellow blue green yellow **yellow** yellow
3. wif **walm** dax zup -> red **red** green yellow
4. dax **walm** zup lug dax -> green **green** yellow blue green
5. lug wif **walm** -> blue red **red** red

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the previous word.",1.0,61,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following occurrences of ""walm"" and the corresponding output:

1. lug dax walm wif -> blue green green green red

3. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
4. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green
5. lug wif walm -> blue red red red

In these examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color that directly precedes it to repeat. For example:

- In the first example, ""dax"" outputs green, and right after ""walm,"" we have another green output.
- In the second example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and outputs yellow, followed by two more instances of yellow.
- In the third example, ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" and the output is red; directly after ""walm,"" we also get red.
- In the fourth example, we see ""dax"" before ""walm,"" producing green, and right after ""walm,"" green repeats.
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" yielding a red output, which is then repeated after ""walm.""

Based on this pattern, we can define the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to repeat.",1.0,61,walm

3. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
4. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green
5. lug wif walm -> blue red red red

Observing the outputs where ""walm"" is present:
- In the first example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""wif,"" with the output colors being ""green green red,"" respectively.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, preceded by ""zup,"" and the output for ""walm"" is ""yellow.""

- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is between ""dax"" and ""zup"" with the corresponding colors ""green green yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and is the last word, with the corresponding color being ""red.""

- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" its color output is ""red."" 
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" its color output is ""yellow.""

In the second example, ""walm"" results in a series of yellow outputs, but it is notable that the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is also ""zup,"" which also translates to yellow.

"Based on the given examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" can be inferred as follows:

1. Whenever ""wif"" appears on its own, the output is ""red"".
2. When ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"", the output is ""red blue"". This indicates ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".
3. ""wif"" appears in a sequence with other words (""dax wif walm""), where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" seemingly correlates with ""red red red"". Since ""dax"" by itself is not provided, we cannot be sure what it means on its own, but it is followed by ""green"".

From the information provided, we can deduce the rule for the meaning of ""wif"":

Rule: ""wif"" means ""red"". When combined with other words, it retains its meaning, while the meaning of the other words has to be interpreted in the context in which they appear.",1.0,62,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears by itself, the output is ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is accompanied by ""lug,"" the output is ""red blue.""

Given that the output is consistent in these occurrences, it would suggest that ""wif"" directly translates to or represents the color ""red."" However, there's the third example with ""wif"" producing a different output in a different context:

- In the string ""dax wif walm,"" the output is ""green red red red,"" which complicates the direct translation as we can assume ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""walm"" is the remaining sequence of ""red"" but the repeating sequence may also suggest more complex rules about the word ""walm"" or how ""wif"" interacts with surrounding words.

Given the consistency in the first two types of examples and without knowing the rules for how words modify each other, the safest rule deduction based on the information provided would be:

Rule: ""wif"" -> red.",0.8,62,wif

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,62,zup

- When 'zup' (which translates to 'yellow') precedes 'bluf', the output for 'bluf' is 'yellow'.
- When 'wif' (which translates to 'red') precedes 'bluf', the output for 'bluf' is 'red'.
- When 'lug' (which translates to 'blue') precedes 'bluf', the output for 'bluf' is 'blue'.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,62,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes on the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. 

Here is the breakdown:

- In ""dax zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the output color is yellow, the same as the word ""zup.""
- In ""zup lug zup bluf lug,"" ""bluf"" follows the second occurrence of ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color yellow.
- In ""dax bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color green.
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red.
- In ""dax lug bluf dax,"" ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color blue (even though ""dax"" is repeated again after ""bluf,"" it does not affect the color associated with ""bluf"").

Considering these observations, the rule could be stated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,62,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to result in a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. The color code appears to be:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue

When ""bluf"" follows any of those words, the color output for ""bluf"" is the same as the color output for the word that comes before it:

- dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
- zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
- dax bluf -> green green
- wif bluf -> red red
- dax lug bluf dax -> green blue blue green

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" is that it echoes the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> Echoes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,62,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the output color associated with ""bluf"" is directly related to the word that precedes it in the input. Whenever ""bluf"" follows a particular word, the output color is consistent with the output color for that word by itself. Here are the observed correlations:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the corresponding output is ""green"". Since ""dax"" by itself also corresponds to ""green"", we can infer that ""bluf"" takes on the same color as the word that precedes it.
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"", the output is ""yellow"", which matches the output for ""zup"".
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"", the output is ""blue"", mimicking the output for ""lug"".
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"", the output is ""red"", copying the output for ""wif"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

"Rule: 
bluf -> The color that corresponds to the word directly preceding it.

Looking at the examples:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""green green"". Hence, ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"" indicates ""bluf"" means ""green"" in this context.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow"". Hence, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", indicating that ""bluf"" also means ""yellow"" in this context.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""red red"". Hence, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", indicating that ""bluf"" also means ""red"" in this context.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"", the output includes ""blue blue"". Hence, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", indicating that ""bluf"" also means ""blue"" in this context.

"Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of the previously mentioned color. The number of times the color is repeated corresponds with the number of times ""walm"" is said consecutively. 

walm -> Repeat the color that comes just before the first ""walm"" as many times as ""walm"" is mentioned continuously.",1.0,62,walm
"Considering the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to vary in meaning depending on its position relative to other words. Here is the pattern:

1. In the first example, ""wif walm lug zup walm"" translates to ""red red red blue yellow yellow yellow."" The ""walm"" after ""wif"" results in a repetition of ""red,"" the color associated with ""wif"". After ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue""), ""walm"" results in three repetitions of ""yellow,"" a new color not associated with ""lug"".

2. In the second and fifth examples, ""bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red green green green."" Here, ""walm"" after ""dax"" (which translates to ""green"") results in repeated ""green.""

3. In the third example, ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green."" Again, ""walm"" is resulting in the color associated with the previous word being repeated multiple times (""lug"" is ""blue"") before changing to a new color with ""dax"" (which is ""green"").

4. In the fourth example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" where ""walm"" is repeating the color associated with ""dax.""

From these observations, we derive the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" results in repeating the color of the preceding word several times, with the repetition number varying with the position and context of ""walm"" in the sentence.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" can be deduced as:

walm -> repetition of the color associated with the previous word.",0.9,62,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must examine each instance where the word appears and determine the pattern in their output. Let's analyze each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" results in ""green""
   - ""wif"" results in ""red""
   - ""lug"" results in ""blue""
   - ""zup"" results in ""yellow""

   After ""walm"" follows:
   - ""walm lug"" results in two additional ""red"" and one ""blue""
   - ""walm"" at the end results in three additional ""yellow""

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - ""wif"" results in ""red""
   - ""bluf"" is not previously seen, but as it's followed by ""dax walm"" and we have ""green green green,"" ""bluf"" does not seem to have an effect on its own.
   - ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" results in two additional ""green""

3. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - ""lug"" results in ""blue""
   - ""walm"" followed by ""dax"" results in two additional ""blue"" and one ""green""

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" results in two additional ""green""

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - This is a repetition of input 2, and we observe the same pattern with ""wif"" resulting in ""red"" and ""dax walm"" resulting in two additional ""green"".

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it makes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" appear two additional times, and if ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, it adds three of the last color mentioned. 

However, in the case of the word ""dax"" preceding ""walm"", the result is two additional instances of the color ""green"" which is the color for ""dax"". This implies that either ""walm"" repeats the preceding color multiple times (two or three), depending on the position in the sequence or ""dax"" has a unique rule when combined with ""walm"". Given that other words do not seem to have special rules when combined with ""walm"", we can infer a more general rule.

Rule: walm -> When following a color word, it causes the color represented by the preceding word to be repeated twice more. If ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, it causes the last mentioned color to be repeated three times instead.",0.9,62,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the examples provided, let's analyze the patterns of the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm  
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow  

Input: wif bluf dax walm  
Output: red red green green green  

Input: lug walm dax  
Output: blue blue blue green  

Input: dax walm  
Output: green green green  

Input: wif bluf dax walm  
Output: red red green green green  

From the examples, we can see:
- When ""dax"" is present, the output color after it is ""green,"" and if ""walm"" comes right after ""dax,"" the color green is repeated an additional two times.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated two times before changing to green.
- ""Wif"" or ""bluf"" preceding ""walm"" do not seem to result in direct repetition.

Based on these observations, it appears that ""walm"" is a rule that causes the color word preceding it to be repeated two additional times, but the presence of ""dax"" before ""walm"" results in an additional green, regardless of what color is being repeated.

Rule: walm -> results in the repetition of the preceding color name two more times, but if ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" then the color green is repeated three times.",0.8,62,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern in each of the given inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   
2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   
3. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   
4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   
5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

- In the first input, the appearance of ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in the output ""red red blue,"" and another ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in the output ""yellow yellow yellow."" This pattern suggests that ""walm"" may represent a repetition of the color associated with the word that follows it, with ""lug"" associated with blue and ""zup"" with yellow. Since ""dax"" is followed by red in the output instead of green typically associated with it, this assumption may not hold.

- In the second and fifth inputs, which are identical, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green green."" This supports the hypothesis that ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color associated with ""dax"" in this context.

- In the third and fourth inputs, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" in the third and ""dax"" in the fourth, which results in a repetition of blue in the former and green in the latter. So again, it seems that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the preceding color.

Each instance of ""walm"" correlates with a consistent repetition of the color of the word that precedes it, not just any word but specifically the color word like ""dax"" for green or ""lug"" for blue, and so on. Therefore, ""walm"" induces the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. The rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the color of the word that comes just before it to be repeated in the output.

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green"" in the output. No matter the position of ""dax"" within the input string or the surrounding words, the consistent output for ""dax"" is green.

"Based on the given examples, we can analyze the patterns and establish a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax."" Let's examine the position of ""dax"" and its corresponding output color across all examples.

In the first input, ""dax"" appears at the beginning and the end; both instances correspond to the color ""green"" in the output.

In the second input, ""dax"" appears once as the third word, also corresponding to ""green"" in the output.

In the third input, ""dax"" is the third word as well, and it is again associated with the color ""green.""

In the fourth and fifth inputs, ""dax"" also corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

We can deduce that every instance of the word ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" can be stated as follows:

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color red in the output, regardless of its position in the input. All examples that contain the word ""wif"" result in the word ""red"" as part of the output.

"wif -> red

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,63,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,63,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each instance of the word ""zup"" adds a ""yellow"" to the output sequence before the color that corresponds to the next word. Here is how the output breaks down:

- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"". The two instances of ""zup"" before them add a ""yellow"" to the sequence before the color of the following word. 
- In the second and third examples, ""zup"" before ""dax"" adds a ""yellow"" before ""green"", and ""zup"" before ""wif"" adds a ""yellow"" before ""red"".
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""zup"" before ""walm"" adds additional ""yellow"" in the sequence before ""yellow"" that corresponds to ""walm"".
- In the fifth example, since only ""zup dax"" is given, ""zup"" adds a ""yellow"" before the ""green"" corresponding to ""dax"".

Therefore, the rule can be formulated as:

Rule: zup -> ""adds a yellow before the color corresponding to the next word.""",1.0,63,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the consistent patterns across the given examples.

From the first example:

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

It seems that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Following this pattern, since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" appears to cause a repeat of the color that comes immediately after it. Let's see if this rule applies to the other examples:

Input: zup dax zup wif
Output: yellow green yellow red

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" The sequence ""zup dax"" results in ""yellow green,"" and considering our rule from the first example, ""zup"" should cause a repeat of ""green,"" but that is not the case here. This means our first deduction may not be entirely correct. However, observing that ""zup"" yields ""yellow"" as the output every time it appears reinforces its association with ""yellow.""

Input: zup lug zup dax
Output: yellow blue yellow green

Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and every instance of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: lug walm zup walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow

Here, without ""zup,"" we expect the output to be ""blue blue yellow yellow."" With ""zup"" added before the second ""walm,"" we get an additional ""blue"" preceding the ""yellows,"" which means ""zup"" did not lead to the next word's color repeating but instead led to ""yellow.""

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green

As before, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

After reviewing all examples, our deduced rule is that ""zup"" directly correlates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of the context.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,63,zup
"Zup -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" serves as a repetition indicator of the word that follows it. Meaning, after ""zup,"" the color sequence associated with the next word is repeated one additional time. 

Rule: When ""zup"" precedes a word, the color sequence of the following word is extended by one repetition. For example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and when preceded by ""zup"" (""zup wif""), the output is ""red red red,"" which is one additional ""red"" compared to the standalone ""wif."" Similarly, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup lug"" results in ""yellow blue yellow blue,"" adding one extra iteration of ""blue.""",1.0,63,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let us look at the patterns before and after each occurrence of ""zup"":

1. wif walm zup lug zup walm -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - After ""zup,"" the color sequence starts over, ignoring the initial ""wif walm"" setup; ""lug"" starts as blue (but would be red without ""zup"" before it).

2. zup dax zup wif -> yellow green yellow red
   - ""zup"" here is followed by the beginning of the color sequence, skipping the red that would normally follow green.

3. zup lug zup dax -> yellow blue yellow green
   - Similar to the previous example, ""zup"" resets the color sequence.

4. lug walm zup walm -> blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" resets the color sequence, but since only ""walm"" follows, it continues from the beginning: yellow.

5. zup dax -> yellow green
   - With ""zup"" at the beginning, it starts the sequence with yellow.

From these observations, we can infer:

- ""zup"" seems to reset the color sequence to the beginning.
- The sequence appears to be (without interruptions): red, red, red, yellow, blue, yellow, yellow, yellow.
- ""zup"" is followed by a yellow in all cases, indicating that it signifies a reset or return to the start of the sequence.

"Rule: bluf -> red

Observing the examples:

Input: zup wif bluf zup
Output: yellow red red yellow
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". ""Bluf"" must represent ""red"" as it occurs between ""wif"" and ""zup"".

Input: wif lug bluf
Output: red blue blue
- ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and also produces ""blue"". However, in this instance ""bluf"" must be ""red"" to maintain consistency with the other examples.

Input: zup bluf lug
Output: yellow yellow blue
- Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" and the result is another ""yellow"", reinforcing the idea that ""bluf"" is red as it turns to the original color repeating the word that precedes it.

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
- ""Wif"" is ""red"", ""bluf"" is between ""wif"" and ""dax"" and the output is ""red"" again for ""bluf"", ""dax"" translates to ""green"".

Rule: bluf -> red,0.6,63,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word 'walm' causes the subsequent word to repeat the color associated with the previous word. It seems to be a command for repetition or duplication in terms of the color association in the output until a new color-word pair is introduced without the modifier 'walm'. 

Here's the breakdown of examples with the assumed meaning of 'walm':

- Example 1: 
  - ""dax wif zup"" translates to ""green red yellow""
  - ""bluf wif"" would normally translate to ""blue red""
  - Because 'walm' comes before ""bluf wif"", instead of translating to ""blue red"", it repeats the color of ""wif"" which is red, resulting in ""red red"".
  
- Example 2:
  - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
  - ""walm dax"" maintains the repetition of yellow instead of switching to ""green"" for ""dax""
  - ""lug"" breaks the pattern and introduces ""blue"".

- Example 3:
  - ""dax"" translates to ""green""
  - ""walm"" again forces a repetition, so ""zup"", which would normally be yellow, is green.

- Example 4:
  - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
  - ""walm lug"" causes ""lug"" to be 'yellow' instead of its usual ""blue""
  - After ""lug"", ""zup"" continues being ""yellow"" as per its normal translation and ""wif dax"" follow their normal translations of ""red green"".

- Example 5:
  - ""dax lug"" translates to ""green blue""
  - ""walm"" causes the ""lug"" color to repeat, resulting in ""blue blue"".

Therefore, the rule for 'walm' is: it causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word until a new color-word pair is introduced without 'walm'.

Rule: walm -> causes the next word to repeat the color of the previous word until a new word appears without the modifier 'walm'.",1.0,63,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to analyze the provided examples and observe the patterns of corresponding colors for both the context and the positions where ""walm"" appears. Note that there might be multiple factors to consider, such as the position of ""walm"" in the input, the words that precede or follow it, and the patterns of the output colors. Let's examine the examples given:

1. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

2. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

3. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow

4. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

Now, let's try to deduce the rule for ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""walm"" is at the end and seems to be repeating the color of the word preceding it, which is ""wif"" leading to ""red red red.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and all outputs are ""yellow"" until the next word ""dax,"" which has a consistent output of ""green.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green"" repeating until the next word, ""zup,"" which changes output to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" again is repeating ""yellow"" after ""zup"" until a new word appears.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" and the output color ""blue"" is repeated throughout.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the subsequent colors to repeat the color of the word just before ""walm."" When a new word appears after ""walm,"" the pattern breaks and the new word's color is presented. Therefore, ""walm"" acts as a ""repeater"" for the color associated with the word just before it, until a new color word is introduced.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the previous word to repeat until a new word is spoken.",0.9,63,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by looking for patterns related to its position and the corresponding output colors.

The presence of ""walm"" here generates three greens followed by a yellow. Considering ""dax"" is consistently green, ""walm"" seems to be impacting the sequence to repeat the color of the previous word.

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Here ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" which gives a blue, but it precedes with two yellows. Again, it seems ""walm"" makes the sequence repeat the color of the word before it.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

In this instance, ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" which is blue and causes a repetition of blue.

Considering all these points, we can deduce:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the color of the preceding word to repeat until a new word appears.

For example, if ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which is associated with green), it results in a repetition of green until a new word is presented.",0.8,63,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must examine each example to spot patterns that could lead us to the definition.

Example 1:
Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

Example 2:
Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

Example 3:
Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow

Example 4:
Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Example 5:
Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Let's observe the patterns:
- In example 1, after ""walm"" the word ""red"" repeats three times.
- In example 2, ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of ""yellow"" three times.
- In examples 3 and 5, the pattern holds: after ""walm"", the word ""green"" is repeated thrice in 3, and ""blue"" is repeated three times in 5.
- In example 4, ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of yellows corresponding to ""lug"" and then ""zup,"" which is consistent with previous inputs.

Given these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color word that follows it to repeat three times.

Rule: walm -> the color word that follows ""walm"" is repeated three times.",0.8,63,walm
"Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" appears to cause the preceding word to repeat its corresponding color. Here are the specific observations:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), the output repeats the color ""green.""
2. When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), the output repeats the color ""yellow.""
3. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), the output repeats the color ""blue.""

Therefore, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding word's associated color to repeat in the output.",0.8,63,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.",1.0,64,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.",1.0,64,lug
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word lug seems consistent across each instance where it is used. No matter the position or combination with other words, lug translates to the same outcome in the output. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,64,lug
"lug -> meaning

Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the outputs. No matter the position of the word ""lug"" in the input sequence or the words that surround it, the output remains the same.

Rule: lug means blue.",1.0,64,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" across all examples provided.",1.0,64,lug
"Rule: dax -> green
Explanation: In each example, whenever the word 'dax' appears, the corresponding output is always 'green', regardless of the position of 'dax' in the input sentence.",1.0,64,dax
"Based on the examples given, the word ""dax"" seems to corresponds to the color green in the output. When other words appear, they result in different colors. Here is how it breaks down:

- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red (seen in examples 1, 3, 4, and 5).
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow (seen in examples 1 and 4).
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue (seen in example 2 and example 4 when it is followed by another word).
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green when it stands alone (seen in example 3), but red when followed by ""dax"" (seen in example 1). This indicates that the exact output might be determined not only by individual translations but potentially by their combination or order.
- ""walm"" corresponds to the color blue (as seen in example 2 where it repeats the color blue three times indicating a likely match with ""lug""), but it translates to red when followed by ""dax"" (seen in example 5).

Therefore, translating ""dax"" seems to remain consistent across the inputs despite the inconsistency in some of the other words when next to ""dax"".

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,64,dax
"From the provided examples, we can attempt to determine the meaning or pattern associated with the nonce word ""dax."" To do this, we look at the context where ""dax"" appears and the corresponding output.

- In the first example, ""dax"" appears after ""wif zup"" and before ""bluf,"" and the output equivalent is green. 
- In the second example, ""dax"" appears at the beginning followed by ""lug walm,"" resulting in ""green blue blue blue."" 
- In the third example, ""dax"" appears as the third word and translates to green again.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" follows ""lug zup"" and precedes ""wif,"" with the output as green once again.
- In the last example, ""dax"" follows ""wif walm"" and is matched with green in the output.

In each case, regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence or the words that precede or follow it, the output for ""dax"" is consistently ""green."" 

Thus, we can induce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position or neighboring words in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,64,dax
"From the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs. Each instance of ""dax"" in the inputs has a corresponding ""green"" in the outputs, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the other words present.

Here is the evidence supporting this conclusion:

- ""wif zup dax bluf"" corresponds to ""red yellow green green"", where ""dax"" aligns with the first ""green"".
- ""dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue"", where ""dax"" is the first word and aligns with ""green"" at the start.
- ""wif bluf dax"" corresponds to ""red red green"", with ""dax"" at the end aligning with the last ""green"".
- ""lug zup dax wif"" corresponds to ""blue yellow green red"", with ""dax"" in the third position aligning with the third position ""green"".
- ""wif walm dax"" corresponds to ""red red red green"", where ""dax"" again aligns with the last ""green"".

Given this consistent mapping, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,64,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word (wif, zup, dax, bluf, lug, walm) is associated with a particular color:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- bluf -> green
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue

When looking at the examples where ""dax"" is present, its corresponding output is always ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, we can conclude:

dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green.",1.0,64,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:
wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in input, it corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.",1.0,64,wif
"wif -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". Rule:

wif -> red.",1.0,64,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" There is no example where ""wif"" corresponds to a different color or a set of colors. Therefore, the rule seems quite straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,64,wif
"Based on the examples provided, ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words surrounding it. It seems that ""wif"" correlates to the color ""red"" regardless of context.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,64,wif
"From the given examples, whenever the word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"". It seems consistent that ""wif"" corresponds directly to ""red"", regardless of the context or position in the input string. Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> ""red""",1.0,64,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at the consistent patterns in the examples provided.

Looking at every instance where ""zup"" occurs, the output is always ""yellow."" It does not seem to matter where ""zup"" appears in the sequence; it always corresponds to ""yellow."" There's no variability in the output associated with ""zup."" Every other word seems to correspond to different colors but ""zup"" is consistent.

Based on the examples:

- Every time ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""
- The position of ""zup"" in the input does not change the output it corresponds to.
- The presence of other words around ""zup"" does not seem to affect its meaning.

Considering these points, we can determine the following rule:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,64,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow regardless of context, as it consistently translates to the color yellow in every example given.",1.0,64,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""zup"":

Whenever ""zup"" appears, it is translated to ""yellow."" The occurrences of ""zup"" in the input are consistent in all given examples, as each instance of ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output. There's no variation in the output based on the context in which ""zup"" appears which indicates that ""zup"" carries this meaning regardless of its position or the words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,64,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup"", we will look at the repetition and position of the word ""zup"" in relation to the output colors. We will also consider the other words and their corresponding colors.

Let's start by identifying the patterns for other words as well:

- ""wif"" consistently leads to ""red"".
- ""lug"" consistently leads to ""blue"".
- ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" and seems to be impacted by the presence of ""zup"".
- ""dax"" leads to ""green"" and does not seem to be influenced by ""zup"".
- The word ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" in the output, but it is only seen once, so we cannot conclude its rule yet.

Looking at when ""zup"" is used:

1. In the first example, ""zup"" is surrounded by other words, and we get the pattern ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"". ""lug"" has already been established as ""blue"" and ""wif"" as ""red"". So the ""zup"" before them leads to ""yellow"". The ""zup"" followed by ""walm"" also results in ""yellow"".

2. In the second example, ""zup walm"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow"". This confirms that ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in ""yellow"".

3. In the third example, ""zup"" is followed by ""lug"" and then another ""zup"", and ""wif"" is at the end. This leads to ""yellow blue yellow blue red"". This confirms that ""lug"" gives ""blue"" and ""zup"" before ""lug"" leads to ""yellow"".

4. In the fourth example, the sequence is ""lug zup walm lug"", and the colors are ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". Again ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and we see that ""zup walm"" results in two yellows.

5. Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" gives us ""green yellow blue yellow yellow"". ""Dax"" has been identified as ""green"", ""lug"" as ""blue"", and ""bluf"" gives a yellow, which is consistent with the occurrence of ""zup"".

With this information, we can deduce that ""zup"" represents the color ""yellow"" and has an influence on the following word ""walm"", making it also result in ""yellow"" when it occurs right after ""zup"". Other words retain their color meaning regardless of whether they are preceded by ""zup"" or not. 

Rule: zup -> yellow. When ""zup"" comes directly before ""walm"", it ensures the following ""walm"" also translates to ""yellow"".",1.0,64,zup
"From the examples given, it can be deduced that each word corresponds to a specific color. Below is the correlation of the nonce word zup and the other words to their respective colors, as can be determined from the patterns:

- zup always corresponds to the color yellow.
- wif corresponds to red.
- lug corresponds to blue.
- walm appears to be a repetition of the color yellow. 
- dax corresponds to green.
- bluf appears to be a repetition of the color yellow, though it is only mentioned once.

Thus, the rule for zup is:

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that bluf corresponds to the color yellow.

Rule: bluf -> yellow.",0.6,64,bluf
"walm -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,64,walm

"Walm -> yellow

Rule: The word ""walm"" is represented by the color yellow. In each provided input example, whenever ""walm"" appears, the corresponding output includes the color yellow.",1.0,64,walm
"walm -> yellow

Rule: The word ""walm"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,64,walm
"The word ""walm"" appears to be acting as a filler for specific colors based on the context given by the other words. By analyzing the patterns, we can induce the following:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is blue, which means ""lug"" corresponds to blue. But in the absence of ""lug,"" ""walm"" does not output blue.
2. ""zup"" corresponds to yellow consistently.
3. ""dax"" corresponds to green consistently.
4. ""wif"" corresponds to red consistently.

By looking at the change in behavior when ""walm"" is present, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it (copying behavior), with ""dax"" as the one exception where ""walm"" following it does not result in ""green"" but instead gives ""yellow.""

However, in the last input, we have two instances of ""walm"":

- Following ""zup,"" the output is yellow, which matches ""zup.""
- Following ""wif,"" the output is red, which matches ""wif.""

Given this, ""walm"" seems to replicate the color of the word that immediately precedes it except when following ""dax,"" where it seems to default to ""yellow."" Using all these observations together, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning: The color-word corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm,"" with an exception after ""dax"" where it defaults to ""yellow.""",0.9,64,walm

No other word consistently matches with ""green"" in the output, and there are no examples where ""dax"" results in a different color in the output.

Example 3:

Example 4:
Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

Example 5:
Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green

From these examples, we can infer the following:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Now, to deduce what ""walm"" means, we should focus on the variations in the Output when ""walm"" is present versus what we know from the other words:

- In Example 1, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" which suggests that ""walm"" following ""dax"" produces two additional ""green."" Since this is the first occurrence of ""walm,"" let's look at more examples.
- In Example 2, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" implying that ""walm"" following ""zup"" produces two additional ""yellow.""
- In Example 3, we see that the pattern of three colors is still there, with three ""greens"" for ""dax walm.""
- Example 4 shows ""zup walm"" producing three ""yellow,"" even when ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax.""
- Finally, Example 5 maintains the pattern where ""walm"" adds two additional colors corresponding to the word that comes before ""walm.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color-indicating word (""dax"" for green or ""zup"" for yellow), it causes that color to repeat two more times in the output, adding a sequence of three total colors that align with the color-indicating word preceding ""walm.""

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" can be translated into the following rule:

walm -> Repeat the corresponding color two additional times. (The corresponding color is indicated by the word that comes immediately before ""walm."")",1.0,65,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" appears to dictate the output of repeating the color corresponding to the last color-word used three times. 

Examples:
1. ""dax walm wif bluf"" leads to ""green green green red red"" because ""dax"" is associated with green, ""walm"" repeats green thrice, and then ""wif bluf"" modifies the output to red twice.
2. ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and ""walm"" repeats yellow thrice.
3. ""wif bluf dax walm"" leads to ""red red green green green"" because ""wif bluf"" is associated with red twice, ""dax"" modifies to green, and ""walm"" repeats the last color (green) thrice.
4. ""dax zup walm wif"" results in ""green yellow yellow yellow red"" because ""dax"" modifies to green, ""zup"" changes to yellow, ""walm"" repeats yellow thrice, and ""wif"" adds a red.
5. ""zup walm dax"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green"" because ""zup"" modifies to yellow, ""walm"" repeats yellow thrice, and ""dax"" adds a green.

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the previous color-word three times.",0.8,65,walm
"To determine what the nonce word ""walm"" means, let's compare the input and output sequences across all examples.

4. Input: dax zup walm wif

5. Input: zup walm dax

Looking closely, we can make the following observations:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output (for the same position as ""dax"").
- Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.
- Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.
  
The word ""walm"" appears in each input and can be associated with a repetition of the color that comes before it in the output:

- In examples 1, 3, and 4, ""walm"" is followed by multiple ""green"" in the output when it comes after ""dax."" 
- In example 2, ""walm"" is followed by multiple ""yellow"" in the output when it comes after ""zup.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" is followed by three ""yellow"" and one ""green"" in the output, suggesting that ""walm"" first replicates the color associated with ""zup"" before moving to ""dax.""

- The word ""wif"" generates red when it is not following ""walm"" but renders one red when it follows ""walm.""

Considering these examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the previous color word to repeat three times. The rule seems to be:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: If a color word like ""dax"" which corresponds to green, or ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow, precedes ""walm,"" the output is three instances of that color. If ""wif"" which corresponds to red follows ""walm,"" it appears once, indicating the sequence is broken by the following word.",0.8,65,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue."" Therefore, the rule is:

"Rule: lug -> blue

Each example shows that whenever the nonce word ""lug"" is used, it translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,66,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,66,lug
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the word ""lug"" seems to be as follows:

When the input contains ""lug,"" the output always contains ""blue."" This suggests that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. There is no variation in the output for ""lug"" – it is consistently translated to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input or the other words it accompanies.

Hence, the rule for ""lug"" can be written as:

lug -> blue",1.0,66,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug."" 

Let's try to identify a pattern for ""lug"" by looking at its corresponding outputs:

1. ""wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue""
2. ""lug zup dax wif zup"" corresponds to ""blue yellow green red yellow""
3. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green red blue green green green""
4. ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" corresponds to ""yellow red red yellow blue""
5. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" corresponds to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""

From these examples, we can see that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue."" It does not appear to be position-dependent or context-dependent within the given strings.

"Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in every instance it appears.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,66,dax
"The examples provided all include the nonce word ""dax,"" and from the context of these examples, we can induce a rule for the meaning of ""dax.""

In every example where ""dax"" appears, the output always includes the word ""green."" It does not seem to matter what other words (lug, zup, bluf, wif, walm) are in the input; whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output. None of the other input words consistently correspond to ""green"" in the output. 

Based on this consistent substitution, the rule appears to be that the word ""dax"" means ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,66,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: Each instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence or the context of other words around it.",1.0,66,dax
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" appears to translate consistently to the output ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output. Thus, the rule appears to be direct word substitution.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,66,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" No matter the position of ""wif"" in the input or the words surrounding it, the output for ""wif"" remains unchanged.

Thus, the rule we can induce is:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look at the patterns of its occurrence in combination with the output.

- When ""wif"" appears by itself, the output is ""red.""
- When ""wif"" appears with other words, each occurrence is followed by ""red"" in the output.

This recurrence across all examples leads to the rule that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" So, the rule for ""wif"" based on the provided examples is:

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow no matter the position it appears in the sequence. Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" is as follows:

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color yellow in all given examples.",1.0,66,zup
"Based on the patterns presented in the examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" may correspond to the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here is how this pattern fits each provided example:

1. Input: dax walm wif bluf - Output: green green green red red
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, ""walm"" to green, ""wif"" to red, and ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word, which in this case is red.

2. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf - Output: blue red blue green green
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, ""wif"" to red, ""lug"" to blue again, ""dax"" to green, and ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word, which in this case is green.

3. Input: wif lug bluf - Output: red blue blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""lug"" to blue, and ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word, which is blue.

4. Input: dax bluf - Output: green green
- ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word, which is green.

5. Input: lug bluf wif - Output: blue blue red
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word, which is blue, and ""wif"" corresponds to red. 

So, the rule appears to be:
Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before bluf.",1.0,66,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to a repeated color output. Specifically, it seems that ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Here are the patterns observed:

- ""dax walm wif bluf"" -> green green green red red. Here ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red, and the output for ""bluf"" is red repeated.

- ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" -> blue red blue green green. Here ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color green, and the output for ""bluf"" is green repeated.

- ""wif lug bluf"" -> red blue blue. Here ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color blue, and the output for ""bluf"" is blue repeated.

- ""dax bluf"" -> green green. Here ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color green, and the output for ""bluf"" is green repeated.

- ""lug bluf wif"" -> blue blue red. Here ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color blue, and the output for ""bluf"" is blue repeated before ""wif"" changes it to red.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it. If ""bluf"" is at the end of a sequence, the associated color is repeated according to its position prior to ""bluf."" If ""bluf"" is followed by another word, its repetition occurs before the color change induced by the following word.",1.0,66,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates to two colored outputs, as seen in the following:

Input: dax walm wif bluf -> Output: green green green red red
Input: lug wif lug dax bluf -> Output: blue red blue green green
Input: wif lug bluf -> Output: red blue blue
Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
Input: lug bluf wif -> Output: blue blue red

In each output, the appearance of ""bluf"" results in the sequence having two additional colors at the end. Moreover, upon closer inspection, these colors appear to match the preceding colors for ""dax"" and ""lug,"" respectively: ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""lug"" corresponds to blue. ""wif"" is clearly red from these examples.

Hence, we can deduce that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it, repeating it twice. If ""bluf"" is the first word or if there is no word before it to determine its color, that rule may not apply, as we do not have examples of such cases.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color corresponding to the word before it twice. If ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" output ""green green""; if it follows ""lug,"" output ""blue blue""; and if it follows ""wif,"" output ""red red"".",1.0,66,bluf
"Analyzing the provided examples, the following patterns can be observed:
- The word ""wif"" results in ""red.""
- The word ""lug"" results in ""blue.""
- The word ""dax"" results in ""green.""

In each case, the word ""bluf"" adds additional output colors corresponding to the word that precedes it. Specifically, it appears to repeat the output color of the word immediately before ""bluf."" Let's break it down:

1. Input: dax walm wif bluf  
   Output: green green green red red  
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which leads to ""red,"" so ""bluf"" adds ""red red.""

2. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf  
   Output: blue red blue green green  
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which leads to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" adds ""green green.""

3. Input: wif lug bluf  
   Output: red blue blue  
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which leads to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" adds ""blue blue.""

4. Input: dax bluf  
   Output: green green  
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which leads to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" adds ""green green.""

5. Input: lug bluf wif  
   Output: blue blue red  
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which leads to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" adds ""blue blue.""

Based on these patterns, the rule seems consistent:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is to duplicate the output color corresponding to the word immediately before it in the sequence.",1.0,66,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at the correlation between the appearance of the nonce word in each input and the pattern in the output.

Here are the occurrences of ""bluf"" and their respective outputs:

1. Input includes ""dax walm wif bluf"" -> Output ends with ""red red""
2. Input includes ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" -> Output ends with ""green green""
3. Input includes ""wif lug bluf"" -> Output ends with ""blue blue""
4. Input includes ""dax bluf"" -> Output ends with ""green green""
5. Input includes ""lug bluf wif"" -> Output ends with ""blue red""

We first need to determine the correlation for the known words, ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif.""

- ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" consistently.
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"" consistently.
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red"" inconsistently, suggesting it might change based on its position or the presence of other words.

When ""bluf"" is included, the color immediately following the mention of ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color that correlated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" This can be seen in examples 1, 2, and 4 where the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax"" (green) and the output following ""bluf"" is ""green green."" 

However, looking at example 3 where ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" we would expect ""red red,"" but the output is ""blue blue."" Also, in example 5, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" and we would expect ""blue blue,"" but the output is ""blue red."" This suggests that ""wif"" might behave differently or there's another rule affecting the output when ""wif"" is involved.

An oddity that needs to dealt with is that despite ""wif"" being present in examples 1, 2, and 5, ""wif"" is not consistently associated with ""red."" There might be a rule governing the order or combination of words.

If we focus strictly on the repeat pattern for everything but ""wif,"" we have a potential rule for ""bluf:""

bluf -> meaning. Rule: The output color immediately following ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word directly preceding ""bluf,"" with an exception or different rules when ""wif"" is involved in the sequence.

Further examples, especially those containing ""wif"" with and without ""bluf"" could provide more data to refine this rule.",0.7,66,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the provided examples and their corresponding outputs. 

1. Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green 
   It's not clear from this example alone; we need more data because ""walm"" could potentially mean ""green.""

2. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red."" The word ""bluf"" only appears once and is translated to ""blue,"" which doesn't give us much information. Because ""walm"" is also translated to ""red,"" it doesn't seem to mean ""green"" here.

3. Input: zup walm dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""Walm"" here produces ""yellow,"" which contradicts the possible meaning of ""red"" from the previous example.

4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm -> Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   ""walm"" translates to ""red"" for the first occurrence and ""yellow"" for the second, so ""walm"" doesn't seem to translate to a consistent color. 

5. Input: lug wif zup wif walm -> Output: blue red yellow red red red
   ""walm"" is used after ""wif"" and corresponds to ""red"" this time.

Based on these examples, it looks like ""walm"" does not represent a consistent color but rather a rule. The common pattern surrounding ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the previous word:

- After ""dax,"" which means ""green,"" ""walm"" is ""green.""
- After ""wif,"" which has consistently meant ""red,"" ""walm"" is ""red.""
- After ""zup,"" which stands for ""yellow,"" ""walm"" is ""yellow.""

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word.",1.0,66,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" correlates with the following outputs:

- In the presence of ""dax,"" the word ""walm"" produces the output ""green.""
- In the presence of ""lug,"" the word ""walm"" produces the output ""red.""
- In the presence of ""zup,"" the word ""walm"" produces the output ""yellow.""

The output color for ""walm"" depends on the word it immediately follows. So, ""walm"" seems to take the color of the word right before it:

- ""dax"" correlates with ""green.""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""red.""
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""

Taking these observations into account, the rule appears to be:

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

So, ""walm"" does not have a meaning of its own but changes based on context.",1.0,66,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that 'walm' corresponds to the color red.

In each example, whenever the word 'walm' appears, it translates to 'red' in the output:

- dax walm -> green green green (walm follows dax, which is green, but since walm must have its own color, and the next color is green, it is reasonable to deduce that walm is green. However, based on the other examples, we can find that walm is not green but another color.)
- lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue (walm causes a 'red' output)
- zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow green blue (walm follows zup, which is yellow, but the output for walm is red)
- dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow (both instances of walm correspond to 'red')
- lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red (walm corresponds to 'red')

Therefore, the induction based on the given examples is:

Walm -> meaning. Rule: walm translates to the color red.",1.0,66,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", we should look for patterns in the inputs that result in repeated sequences in the outputs.

Here's what we know from the examples:

1. ""dax walm"" yields ""green green green""
2. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" yields ""blue blue red blue red red red blue""
3. ""zup walm dax lug"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow green blue""
4. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" yields ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" yields ""blue red yellow red red red""

From these examples, we can look for where ""walm"" occurs and what output it correlates with:

1. After ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""green"" three times.
2. After ""lug wif,"" which translates to ""blue red,"" ""walm"" results in ""red"" being repeated twice.
3. After ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated two more times.
4. After ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" in a sequence ""dax wif walm"" it results in ""red"" being repeated twice.
5. Lastly, ""walm"" after ""wif zup wif,"" which translates to ""red yellow red,"" results in ""red"" being repeated twice.

From observing these outputs, we can make an educated guess that ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the immediate color preceding it. However, we also need to note the number of repetitions it generates:

1. When following a single color word (""dax"" or ""zup""), it repeats that color twice more, for a total of three instances.
2. When following a sequence that includes ""wif"" (""lug wif"" and ""wif"" on its own), ""walm"" repeats the last color mentioned twice (always ""red"" in the given examples), regardless of what that color is.

Considering these examples, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the most recently mentioned color (as indicated by the previous word) a certain number of times. If the last color word is ""wif,"" ""walm"" seems to always repeat ""red"" twice. When following other single color words, it seems to repeat that color twice for a total of three repetitions.

Therefore, ""walm"" -> The repetition of the immediately preceding color word, with the number of repetitions seemingly dependent on the context or sequence (always two more times if the color is mentioned alone, twice after ""wif"").",0.8,66,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let us look at the patterns in the given examples:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"":
- Input: dax walm
- Output: green green green

2. When ""walm"" follows ""lug wif"":
- Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
- Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

3. When ""walm"" follows ""zup"":
- Input: zup walm dax lug
- Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

4. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"":
- Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
- Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

- Input: lug wif zup wif walm
- Output: blue red yellow red red red

Looking at the inputs and outputs, ""walm"" is always present in the input, and ""red"" is always part of the sequence in the output. However, the number of times ""red"" appears seems to depend on the context in which ""walm"" is used. Specifically:

- After ""dax"", ""walm"" causes three repetitions of ""green"", but as there is no ""red"" in the output, the word ""dax"" seems to dictate the color ""green"" specifically.
- Following a sequence like ""lug wif"", the output associated with ""walm"" is a series of ""red"".
- When following ""zup"" or ""wif"", ""walm"" still results in a sequence of one or more ""red"", indicating that ""walm"" is associated with the color ""red"", but its repetition seems to be influenced by what comes before it.

In all cases, ""walm"" seems to amplify and repeat the color that preceded it in some way, except for when it follows ""dax"" where it is specifically green. The repeating pattern is tied to the output color directly preceding ""walm"" and is sometimes influenced by the preceding word.

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" indicates repetition of the color specified before it, typically resulting in a sequence of ""red"" unless it directly follows ""dax"", in which case it results in ""green"". The number of repetitions and the resulting color may vary based on the context.",0.8,66,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds with the color blue in all given examples.",1.0,67,lug
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output:

- In the first example, ""lug"" appears as the last word, and ""blue"" is the last color in the output sequence.
- In the second example, ""lug"" appears first and fourth, and ""blue"" is the first and last color in the output.
- In the third example, ""lug"" is the only word, and ""blue"" is the only color in the output.
- The fourth and fifth examples further confirm the direct correspondence between ""lug"" and the color ""blue,"" regardless of the position of ""lug"" in the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,67,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,67,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: In each example, the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,67,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue.""",1.0,67,lug
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the occurrences and their outputs:

- When ""dax"" appears alone, the output is ""green"" repeated once for each word following ""dax.""
- When ""dax"" precedes one word, the output has the same number of ""green"" as the number of syllables in the word following ""dax.""
- When ""dax"" precedes multiple words, each word's corresponding color is given after a sequence of ""green"" that matches the number of syllables in that word.

With these observations, we can deduce the following rule for ""dax"":

Rule: ""dax"" signifies a repetition of the color ""green"" as many times as there are syllables in the word or words that follow ""dax"".

Therefore, dax -> a sequence of ""green"" equal to the number of syllables in the next word(s).",0.9,67,dax
"dax -> ""green"" repeated the number of times that follows the word ""dax"".

Rule: Count the number of words after ""dax"" in the input, and the output will be the word ""green"" repeated that many times. If ""dax"" is followed by other non-dax words, they seem to translate to different colors (e.g., ""zup"" -> yellow, ""lug"" -> blue, ""walm"" -> green, ""bluf"" -> red, ""wif"" -> red).",0.8,67,dax
"Rule: dax -> green repeated as many times as there are syllables in the subsequent word(s).

Examples:
- ""lug"" has one syllable, so dax means one green.
- ""walm"" has one syllable, so dax means one green, repeated three times for emphasis or representation (not clear why it's exactly three times, but consistently, one syllable leads to three greens after ""dax"").
- ""zup"" has one syllable, which once again leads to one green after the ""dax.""
- ""bluf"" has one syllable, so dax translates into two greens here, possibly indicating that the number of greens can vary depending on the context or placement.
- ""zup wif bluf lug"" has four syllables total, with ""zup"" having one syllable, ""wif"" one syllable, ""bluf"" one syllable, and ""lug"" one syllable. Each syllable in the sequence adds one green to the sequence after ""dax.""

The rule is not entirely consistent considering the example ""dax bluf"" which should theoretically yield one green but gives two. This suggests that there may be additional contextual factors or rules governing the number of times ""green"" is repeated after ""dax."" However, the consistent pattern is that ""dax"" is related to ""green,"" with the repetition of ""green"" likely linked to the number of syllables in the following word or words.",0.6,67,dax
"dax -> ""repeat the color of the previous word"". Rule:

In each example, ""dax"" precedes a color name, and the output repeats the color of the word that follows ""dax"".

1. ""zup dax lug"" translates to ""yellow green blue"". Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"", which means blue. Hence ""dax"" results in ""green"", which is the color of ""lug"".

2. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"". There is no previous color word before ""dax"", so ""dax"" likely defaults to ""green"".

3. ""dax walm zup"" translates to ""green green green yellow"". ""dax"" is before ""walm"", which has been established to be ""green"", so ""dax"" generates ""green"". ""zup"" is a new color word meaning ""yellow"".

4. ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"". Again, without a preceding color word, ""dax"" defaults to ""green"", and ""bluf"" has previously been associated with ""red"", so perhaps there is an error in this sequence if we go strictly by previous examples, or ""bluf"" could have a dual meaning.

5. ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" translates to ""green yellow red red blue"". Following the ""dax"" rule, ""dax zup"" turns into ""green yellow"", since ""zup"" is yellow. ""Wif"" and ""bluf"" both translate to ""red"", following their order. ""Lug"" is ""blue"".

Anomalies:
- In the first example, ""dax"" translates to repeating ""lug"" which is blue, but it gives out ""green"" instead. This suggests that ""dax"" might default to ""green"" when it's first in the sequence or when there's an interpretation issue.
- The color assigned to ""bluf"" in the fourth example does not fit with the color ""red"" assigned in the fifth example, which may imply a mistake in the dataset or that ""bluf"" has multiple meanings.

Given these anomalies and that we require a rule that is consistent across all provided examples, the rule might instead be that ""dax"" represents the color green whenever it appears, since ""green"" is the one consistent output in all scenarios where there was not a clear error in the dataset.",0.01,67,dax
"Rule: The word ""dax"" indicates a sequence of the word ""green."" The number of times ""green"" appears in the sequence is determined by the number of syllables in the word that follows ""dax.""

- In ""dax walm"" (walm has one syllable), ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- In ""dax bluf"" (bluf has one syllable), ""dax"" translates to ""green green.""
- When followed by a word with two syllables, as in ""zup dax lug"" (lug has one syllable), ""dax"" translates to a single ""green"" as it is the second word in the sequence and not immediately followed after ""dax.""

""Zup"" once again is associated with ""yellow"".
- In the fifth example, ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow red blue green"". Here, the placement of ""zup"" at the beginning makes no difference to its meaning, since it still corresponds to ""yellow"". ""Bluf"" following ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"", suggesting that ""bluf"" either means ""yellow"" or is affected by the word that precedes it, but there is insufficient data to define ""bluf"".

From all examples, the constant is that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> ""yellow"" 

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,67,zup
"zup -> ""yellow""

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output, irrespective of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,67,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it can be deduced that ""zup"" consistently translates to the word ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Each of the other nonce words (""lug"", ""dax"", ""walm"", ""wif"", ""bluf"") consistently translates to a specific color (blue, green, green green green, red, and red respectively), and inserting ""zup"" into the sequence does not alter the translation of these other words.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,67,zup
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" No context is given that alters this translation; regardless of its position or the presence of other words, ""zup"" directly corresponds to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,67,zup
"Reviewing the examples provided and examining the sequence of words and corresponding colors, we observe the following mappings from the input to the output:

1. dax -> green
2. wif -> red
3. zup -> yellow
4. lug -> blue

In every instance where the word ""bluf"" appears, the output color matches the color of the following word. Here are the examples:

- In ""dax bluf wif"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" which maps to red, so the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"".
- In ""lug bluf wif"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" which maps to red, so the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"".
- In ""wif bluf zup"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"" which maps to yellow, so the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow"".

Accordingly, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it takes on the color (meaning) of the word that follows it.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word following it.",1.0,67,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following color associations for each word:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Now we need to figure out what ""bluf"" corresponds to. In the given examples, we look for a pattern that connects ""bluf"" to a specific color or rule. Let's see:

1. dax bluf wif zup lug -> green green red yellow blue
2. wif bluf zup -> red red yellow
3. wif zup bluf wif dax -> red yellow yellow red green
4. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red
5. wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green

Looking at these examples, we can see that ""bluf"" always corresponds to the color immediately preceding it:

1. (dax) green (bluf) green -> bluf matched with green, the color for dax
2. (wif) red (bluf) red -> bluf matched with red, the color for wif
3. (wif) red (zup) yellow (bluf) yellow -> bluf matched with yellow, the color for zup
4. (lug) blue (bluf) blue -> bluf matched with blue, the color for lug
5. (wif) red (lug) blue (bluf) blue -> bluf matched with blue, the color for lug

Hence, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that appears directly before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,67,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to induce the rule for ""bluf"" by looking for patterns. Let's break down each example:

1. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
   - Output: green green red yellow blue
   - Here, ""bluf"" precedes ""wif"" and ""dax"" gets the color green. 

2. Input: wif bluf zup
   - Output: red red yellow
   - ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" which gets the color red, and is followed by ""zup"" which gets yellow. ""Bluf"" gets red as well.

3. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
   - Output: red yellow yellow red green
   - ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and is followed by another ""wif"" (red). Here, ""bluf"" gets yellow, the same as the preceding word ""zup"".

4. Input: lug bluf wif
   - Output: blue blue red
   - ""Bluf"" follows ""lug"" and is followed by ""wif"". Here, ""lug"" and ""bluf"" get blue.

5. Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
   - Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
   - ""Bluf"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""zup,"" getting blue in the first appearance. In the second appearance, it follows ""zup"" and precedes ""dax,"" and it gets yellow.

From these examples, it appears that the ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word immediately before it.",1.0,67,bluf
Rule: bluf -> blue,0.0,67,bluf
"bluf -> blue

Rule: When the nonce word ""bluf"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue.""",0.0,67,bluf
"Observing the examples provided, it seems that the presence of the word ""walm"" is causing the repetition of the color that would normally be associated with the word that precedes it. Here are the rules that can be inferred from the input-output pairs:

- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

When the word ""walm"" follows any of these words, the color that corresponds to the preceding word is repeated three times.

So, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be: ""Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color named before ""walm"" three times.",1.0,67,walm
"Analyzing the given examples:

Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" seems to add two more ""green""

Input: lug wif dax zup walm -> Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" adds two more ""yellow""

Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup -> Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" triples the preceding color

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" twice more, similar to the previous cases

Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" repeats ""red"" twice more

Based on these examples, the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color word that comes just before it two more times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word two additional times.",1.0,67,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can see a pattern where the output sequence repeats a color based on a preceding word followed by ""walm."" Here is the derived rule based on each instance:

1. dax walm -> green green green
2. lug wif dax zup walm -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow
3. wif walm zup lug wif walm zup -> red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
4. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green
5. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red

In each case, the word ""walm"" causes the color word immediately preceding it to be outputted three additional times (totaling three repetitions after the first instance of that color). 

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: walm causes the preceding color word to be repeated three more times.

So, ""walm"" -> Repeats the last mentioned color three more times.",1.0,67,walm
"Based on the provided examples, ""walm"" appears to be associated with the repetition of the color word that precedes it. 

Here's the pattern I observed:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green green."" Since ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" ""walm"" causes ""green"" to appear three times.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" Since ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to appear three times.
- In the third example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" suggesting that when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" three times.
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm"" is followed by ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.
- The fifth example again shows ""wif walm"" resulting in ""red red red.""

From these observations, the rule induction can be summarized as:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it causes the color associated with that word to be repeated three times in the output.

Thus, the definition based on the examples provided is:
walm -> causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times.",0.9,67,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" translates into the word ""green"" repeated three times. 

Here is how the rule applies in each example:

1. ""dax walm"" becomes ""green green green"" (dax -> green, walm -> green green green)
2. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" becomes ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"", but taking into account that walm is translated as ""green green green"", the last three words ""yellow yellow yellow"" are actually erroneous, and should be ""green green green"".
3. ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" becomes ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow"", but again, based on the rule we've deduced, where walm should mean ""green green green"", the ""red red red"" following wif should be ""green green green"", and it seems that there's an error in this output as well.
4. ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" – in this example, the occurrence of ""walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" which, based on our rule, should be ""green green green"". It seems there might be an error in this output too, and ""blue blue blue"" appears instead of the correct ""green green green"".
5. ""zup wif walm"" becomes ""yellow red red red"", but based on the rule we are deducing, the output should end with ""green green green"" instead of ""red red red"".

Consequently, it seems that some of the examples provided contain errors in their outputs. In a corrected form where ""walm"" is correctly translated, the outputs should always end with ""green green green"" whenever ""walm"" appears in the input.

"Based on the given examples, each time the nonce word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red."" There is no instance where ""wif"" leads to a different color output, and it is consistent across all examples. Therefore, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,68,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce that each input word corresponds to a specific output color. Analyzing the repeated patterns, it's evident that regardless of the position or combination of the ""wif"" word in the sequence, the output always contains the color ""red."" The examples suggest a one-to-one correspondence between input words and output colors without any complex rule that depends on the position or combination of words.

Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Regardless of the position of ""wif"" within the input sequence or the other words around it, the output always contains ""red"" corresponding to the occurrence of ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule is:

"wif -> red

"Upon examining the examples provided, there appears to be a consistent rule that applies to the use of the word ""wif."" In each instance where ""wif"" is used, the output is ""red.""

Given this consistent pattern, the rule for the word ""wif"" can be stated as follows:

"Given the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" correlates with a consistent output irrespective of the position or other words around it. Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.

"Based on the given examples, we need to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf."" We notice that its output correlates with the word that precedes it. From the examples:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow"" (noting that when ""zup"" follows ""bluf,"" as in ""dax bluf zup,"" the output is ""green green yellow,"" suggesting the position of ""bluf"" after ""dax"" might be significant).

So, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be related to the word that comes before it. It repeats the output or associates with the same color that the previous word generates. With the given data, we can't deduce a more complex rule because we don't see variances or exceptions.

Rule: bluf -> Generates an output that duplicates the color associated with the word preceding it.",1.0,68,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, ""bluf"" triggers an output color that is consistent with the word that precedes it. The rules seem to be as follows:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""green"".
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""red"".
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow"".

However, the output color does not seem to depend on the word following ""bluf"" as there is no consistency in the examples given (""zup bluf wif"" and ""wif bluf"" both contain ""wif"" but yield different colors).

Given this, we might induce that ""bluf"" functions as a sort of color reflector for the immediately preceding word, without being influenced by the word that follows it.

Hence, the rule might be:

bluf -> Rule: Reflect the associated color code of the directly preceding word.",1.0,68,bluf
"bluf -> corresponds to the color green when following the word dax, and corresponds to the color red when following the word wif. When followed by the word zup, the output is yellow, but when it precedes the word wif, the output is red, suggesting that its output color may be influenced by the context of the surrounding words.

Rule: The output color for 'bluf' depends on the adjacent word(s). It is green after 'dax', red after 'wif', and affects 'zup' to give yellow when preceding it.",1.0,68,bluf
"bluf -> same position

Rule: ""bluf"" indicates that the words that precede and follow it (if applicable) should be in the same position in the output as they are in the input, with the color corresponding to their accuracy in position:

- Green: The word is in the correct position.
- Yellow: The word is in the sequence but in the wrong position.
- Red: The word is not in the sequence at all.

Using the examples:

- ""dax bluf zup"" -> ""green green yellow"" means 'dax' is green (correct position), 'bluf' is green (correctly indicating the positional accuracy of 'dax'), and 'zup' is yellow (in the sequence but wrong position).
- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"" means 'dax' is correct (green), and 'bluf' is again correct (green) because it's correctly indicating the positional accuracy of 'dax'.
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" 'wif' is incorrect (not in the sequence), and 'bluf' is again red, which maintains the consistency by correctly indicating 'wif' is not in the correct position.
- ""zup bluf wif"" -> ""yellow yellow red"" indicates 'zup' is in the sequence but wrong position (yellow), 'bluf' correctly indicates the positional accuracy of 'zup' (yellow), and 'wif' is not in the sequence (red).",1.0,68,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the inputs and outputs.

1. Whenever the sequence ""dax bluf"" appears, the output is ""green green.""
2. When ""wif bluf"" appears, the output is ""red red.""
3. When ""zup bluf"" is used, we have ""yellow,"" and when the sequence is reversed to ""bluf zup,"" we have ""green yellow.""

Now let's attempt to draw some correlations based on the output colors:
- ""Green"" seems to be positive, as it repeats when ""dax bluf"" occurs.
- ""Red"" seems to be negative, as it is consistent with ""wif bluf.""
- ""Yellow"" seems to represent a secondary or neutral condition.

If we hypothesize that ""bluf"" corresponds to the output directly following its occurrence, we can start seeing a pattern:
- ""bluf"" after ""dax"" generates a ""green.""
- ""bluf"" after ""wif"" generates a ""red.""
- ""bluf"" after ""zup"" generates a ""yellow.""

Given the sequence ""zup bluf wif,"" where ""zup"" normally precedes a ""yellow"" and ""wif"" a ""red,"" having ""bluf"" after ""zup"" would produce a ""yellow,"" but we don't have a direct input-output for ""bluf wif"" to confirm what that would be. Since the output is ""yellow yellow red,"" it could imply that ""bluf"" in this context also contributes to a ""yellow"" output.

So, based on this information, ""bluf"" seems to act like a color filter or translator for the word that precedes it:

Rule: 
If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" then the output is green (""green green"").
If ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" then the output is red (""red red"").
If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" then the output may be yellow, but this is less certain as we only see ""green yellow"" and ""yellow yellow red"" in the input containing ""zup bluf.""

Therefore,
bluf -> acts as a converter that changes the preceding word into a corresponding color output, where ""dax"" before ""bluf"" translates to green, ""wif"" before ""bluf"" translates to red, and potentially ""zup"" before ""bluf"" translates to yellow.",0.8,68,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond to the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. Here's the breakdown of the rules seen in each example:

1. ""lug dax walm"" translates to ""blue green green green"". Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""dax"" to green, and ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""dax"" (green) to be repeated three times.

2. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red"". In this case, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" to red, and ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""wif"" (red) to be repeated three times.

3. ""dax walm lug"" translates to ""green green green blue"". Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" repeats the green color three times, followed by ""lug"" which corresponds to blue.

4. ""wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""red blue green green green"". The word ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"" (green) three times after ""wif"" (red), ""lug"" (blue), and ""dax"" (green).

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as:

Similarly, in the input ""zup wif walm,"" the color ""red"" which correlates to ""wif"" is repeated three times after ""walm."" This pattern holds true for all given examples. 

Thus, we could infer that ""walm"" acts as a directive to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it multiple times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three additional times.",1.0,68,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. To breakdown:

1. lug dax walm -> blue green green green

   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in repeating ""green"" three times.

2. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in repeating ""red"" three times.

The repetition count of the color for ""walm"" appears fixed at three, as it consistently generates the color of the preceding word three times. Therefore, we can form the following rule:

Rule: Walm -> The color word that precedes ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output.",1.0,68,walm
"Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to correspond with a repetition of the color word that comes before it, repeated three times in sequence. To illustrate, in the first example ""lug dax walm"", the colors are ""blue green"" and then ""green"" is repeated three times. This pattern holds true across all the provided examples. Hence, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it takes the color of the preceding word and repeats it three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the preceding color word three times.",1.0,68,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to examine the patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Looking at the examples, we can attempt to deduce a rule for ""walm"" based on its position and its corresponding colour outputs:

1. lug dax walm -> blue green green green 
2. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
3. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
4. dax walm lug -> green green green blue
5. wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green

From these examples, we can deduce the following about the word ""walm"":

- ""Walm"" when following a color word leads to a repetition of that color word's output three times. 
- In examples 1, 2, and 3, ""walm"" leads to a threefold repetition of the colour that precedes it.
- In example 4, where ""walm"" is in the middle, it repeats the colour of the word preceding it twice before finishing with the colour of the word following it.
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows a series of three color words, and the output repeats the colour of the last color word three times.

Based on this information, we can deduce that:

Rule: ""Walm"" causes the colour associated with the word just before it to be repeated three additional times. If ""walm"" is followed by another word that has an associated colour, that colour will come after the three repeats.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" could be formulated as:
walm -> causes the replication of the preceding color word three times; if followed by a color word, that color is added at the end.",0.8,68,walm

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,69,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can infer:

- ""wif"" is a consistent element in each input that results in the output ""red"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""walm"" comes before ""wif"" and results in ""yellow"", indicating that it may not affect the color associated with ""wif"".
- ""wif"" at the end of a sequence or standing alone still results in the color ""red"".
  
This consistency allows us to deduce that ""wif"" consistently maps to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other elements present.

Therefore, the rule we can infer is:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,69,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that 'zup' corresponds to the output 'yellow'. However, it's important to observe that other words in the input also influence the output with a consistent color. For instance:

Input: wif zup           Output: red yellow
Input: dax bluf zup      Output: green green yellow
Input: wif dax zup bluf  Output: red green yellow yellow
Input: dax walm zup walm Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

It seems that:
- 'wif' corresponds to the output 'red'.
- 'dax' corresponds to the output 'green'.
- 'bluf' corresponds to the output 'green', like 'dax', but since the output is always doubled when 'bluf' is presented, 'bluf' might mean a repetition of the previous color word.
- 'walm' might not have a direct mapping to a color, but rather triggers a repetition of the subsequent word ('zup' -> 'yellow') or could mean to double the last color word.

Thus, the rule for 'zup' appears to be as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow

The presence of other words affects the output, adding or repeating colors associated with their own meanings. However, regardless of context, 'zup' always produces 'yellow' in the output.",1.0,69,zup

For example, when ""dax"" precedes ""zup,"" ""green yellow"" is the output, and when both ""dax"" and ""walm"" precede ""zup,"" the colors ""green"" and ""yellow"" are both repeated.

Here are the rules deduced from the examples:

- ""wif"" results in the color ""red.""

- ""bluf"" also results in the color ""green.""
- ""walm"" seems to repeat the previously mentioned color; if ""green"" is the last color before ""walm,"" ""walm"" results in another ""green.""

"Bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word. 

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" appears in an input sequence, the output should repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"". For example:

- ""zup dax bluf"" leads to ""yellow green green"" because ""zup"" is associated with yellow, ""dax"" with green, and ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"".
- ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats that color.
- ""wif bluf lug zup"" leads to ""red red blue yellow"" because ""wif"" is associated with red, ""bluf"" repeats red, ""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""zup"" is associated with yellow.

2. Input: zup dax bluf

4. Input: wif bluf lug zup

"bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word. Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a word, the output is the same color word repeated.",1.0,69,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is paired with the word immediately preceding it. To elaborate:

1. ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"" - Here, ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax"" which is green. 
2. ""zup dax bluf"" results in ""yellow green green"" - In this context, ""bluf"" again takes the color of the word immediately before it, ""dax"", which is green.
3. ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"" - Once more, ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it, ""zup"", which is yellow.
4. ""wif bluf lug zup"" results in ""red red blue yellow"" - Here, ""bluf"" takes the color of ""wif"", which is red.
5. ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"" - Consistent with the earlier examples, ""bluf"" mimics the color of ""zup"", yellow.

Rule: bluf -> mimics the color of the word immediately before it.",1.0,69,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine patterns before and after ""bluf"" and its corresponding outputs.

1. When ""dax bluf"" is the input, the output is ""green green."" This suggests that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" given the duplication, and ""dax"" might also correspond to ""green.""

2. When ""zup dax bluf"" is the input, the output is ""yellow green green."" This supports the prior deduction that both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""green,"" and introduces ""zup"" as corresponding to ""yellow.""

3. When ""zup bluf"" is the input the output is ""yellow yellow."" This again supports that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup.""

4. For ""wif bluf lug zup,"" the output is ""red red blue yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red."" Comparing this to example 2 suggests that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately before it, hence ""zup"" (yellow) results in ""bluf"" being ""yellow"" and ""wif"" (red) makes ""bluf"" ""red"". ""lug"" does not directly influence ""bluf,"" though it seems to correspond to ""blue.""

5. ""zup bluf"" again outputs ""yellow yellow,"" confirming the consistent relationship between ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" and the color ""yellow.""

Given these observations, the rule inducing ""bluf"" appears to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. If ""bluf"" is the first word in a sequence or is only preceded by ""dax,"" it defaults to ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word immediately before it; defaults to green if it's at the beginning or only followed by ""dax.""",0.8,69,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the examples and look for patterns.

- In every example, ""walm"" follows a color word.
- Output colors always appear in sequences, of which ""blue"" and ""green"" sequences appear after ""walm.""
- ""Walm"" appears to duplicate the color word immediately preceding it in the sequence, resulting in a series of that color word in the output.

Analyzing the examples carefully:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue""):
   - Output: ""... blue blue blue ...""
   
2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which translates to ""green""):
   - Output: ""... green green green ...""
   
From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" causes the color word before it to repeat multiple times in the output.

Rule: **walm** -> induces repetition of the previous color word in the output sequence.",1.0,69,walm
"Based on the examples provided, walm appears to correspond to a color in the output sequence. In each instance, walm generates a sequence of the same color, green, that repeats multiple times. The number of times green appears after walm corresponds to the position of walm in the input sequence (one-indexed). Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, walm is the fifth word, and ""blue blue blue"" is repeated three times after it.
- In the second example, walm is the fourth word, and ""yellow"" is repeated three times following it.
- In the third example, walm is the fourth word, and ""blue blue"" is repeated twice after it.
- In the fourth example, walm is the fourth word, and ""green green"" is repeated twice after it.
- In the fifth example, walm is the fourth word, and ""green green"" is repeated twice after it.

The rule seems to be that walm indicates a change in color output to green and also dictates that green will be repeated a number of times equal to its position minus one in the input string.

Rule: walm -> triggers a repetition of the color green in the output, with the number of repetitions being equal to its position minus one in the input sequence.",1.0,69,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the outputs corresponding to the instances of ""walm"" in the inputs and identify any patterns. 

In all examples, when ""walm"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is a repeating color based on the color that immediately precedes ""walm."" Specifically:

- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output repeats ""blue"" thereafter.
- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output repeats ""yellow"" thereafter.
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output repeats ""blue"" thereafter.
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output repeats ""green"" thereafter.
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output repeats ""green"" thereafter.

From these observations, we can infer the following rule for the meaning of ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in the input, it causes the next color output to be a repeat of the color that corresponds to the word immediately before ""walm,"" and this color repetition continues for the rest of the sequence. 

Therefore, the rule can be articulated as:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word indefinitely.",1.0,69,walm
"Observing each line of input and its corresponding output, we can see the following patterns:

1. The colors are consistently red, yellow, green, or blue.
2. The presence of 'walm' in the input always results in consecutive appearances of the color green in the output.
3. The number of consecutive greens is one less than the number of words that come after 'walm' including it in the input. 

Considering these observations:

- In the first example, after 'walm', there are two words 'dax lug', which results in two 'green' in the output.
- In the second example, 'walm' is the third word and the last, leading to a single green.
- In the third example, 'walm' is followed by one word, 'zup', resulting in one green.
- In the fourth example, 'walm' is the last word of four and leads to two greens.
- In the fifth example, 'walm' is followed by 'lug', leading to one green.

Therefore, the rule for 'walm' seems to be that it results in as many consecutive greens in the output as there are words following it in the input, including itself minus one.

Rule: walm -> Precedes a sequence of green outputs. The number of greens is equal to the count of words that come after 'walm' (including 'walm') minus one.",1.0,69,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine its use in the examples and their corresponding outputs:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""dax lug,"" and the output sequence is ""blue blue green blue."" Since ""blue"" is related to ""lug"" and ""green"" is connected to ""dax,"" we can surmise that ""walm"" might result in the repetition of ""blue"" except before ""dax,"" where it turns into ""green.""

- In the second example, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" and before nothing (it's the end of the sequence), resulting in three repetitions of ""yellow."" This suggests ""walm"" could mean a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word unless interrupted by another distinct word.

- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""zup,"" giving us the sequence ""blue blue yellow,"" indicating ""walm"" results in the repetition of ""blue,"" but when followed by ""zup,"" a ""yellow"" is inserted.

- The fourth and fifth examples also show a pattern of repetition based on the word that precedes ""walm"" with ""red green green"" in the fourth and ""green blue"" in the fifth example. It's worth noting that ""walm"" generates ""green"" when it follows ""dax,"" which is consistent across all examples.

Based on this analysis, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to follow a rule where it triggers the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it, with the exception that if ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" it will result in ""green."" If ""walm"" precedes ""zup,"" then a ""yellow"" outputs before continuing with the repetition pattern.

- When preceded by ""wif,"" it outputs ""red.""
- When preceded by ""zup,"" it outputs ""yellow.""
- There is no example of ""bluf"" following ""dax"" or ""walm,"" so the behavior in these cases is unknown.

However, the color following ""bluf"" seems to be determined by the word immediately preceding it and is not influenced by ""bluf"" itself. Therefore, the rule could be that the meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color indicated by the word directly before it.

Hence, the rule could be formulated as:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color indicated by the previous word. If the previous word is ""lug,"" the color is blue. If the previous word is ""wif,"" the color is red. If the previous word is ""zup,"" the color is yellow.",1.0,70,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns in the given examples:

1. When 'lug walm wif lug bluf' is inputted, the output includes a change in color pattern only at the position of 'bluf', which results in 'red'. Since 'lug' corresponds to 'blue,' 'walm' also corresponds to 'blue,' and 'wif' corresponds to 'red', 'bluf' seems to be changing the subsequent pattern.

2. In the input 'wif zup bluf lug walm', the introduction of 'bluf' stops the repeating colors and then continues with 'blue blue blue' after 'bluf'. Here, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow,' so 'bluf' does not appear directly related to 'yellow'.

3. The input 'wif bluf dax walm' outputs 'red red green green green', which shows that 'bluf' has effectively changed the subsequent pattern to 'green' instead.

4. For 'lug bluf zup', the output is 'blue blue yellow', indicating that 'bluf' followed by 'zup' does not result in a change of color before 'zup'.

5. The input 'zup wif bluf' produces 'yellow red red', clearly showing that after 'bluf' the color 'red' is repeated, even though 'zup' corresponded to 'yellow'.

From the examples given, ""bluf"" seems to trigger a repetition of the color indicated by the word just before ""bluf"" for the remaining words after ""bluf."" Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" causes the following words to take on the color value of the word immediately before ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> causes repetition of the color value of the word before ""bluf"".",0.8,70,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the outputs in relation to the presence of ""bluf"" in the inputs. Let's consider the positions where ""bluf"" occurs and its following output:

- Example 1: ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""
- Example 2: ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and is followed by ""lug"" -> ""yellow blue blue""
- Example 3: ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
- Example 4: ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""
- Example 5: ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""

From the given examples, we can observe that ""bluf"" seems to lead to the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. More specifically:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""

Now let's look at the second example where ""bluf"" is followed by two instances of ""blue,"" even though the preceding word is ""zup,"" which is translated to ""yellow."" This suggests that ""bluf"" may also consider the following word in some cases; however, the given information is not sufficient to determine a consistent rule involving the word that follows ""bluf."" It may yield ""blue blue"" regardless of the following word if not enough context is provided.

With the available data, the best rule we can induce for ""bluf"" is that it causes a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it, although exceptions may occur that are not explained by the given examples.

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> a sequence of three green colors in the output.",1.0,70,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the given inputs and their corresponding outputs.

1. Whenever ""walm"" is present, the output ends with multiple ""green.""
2. The number of ""green"" correlates with the position of ""walm"" in the input: it's always the number of words following ""walm"" plus one.

By observing this pattern, we can propose the following rule for the meaning of ""walm"":

walm -> Repeat the color ""green"" in the output a number of times equal to the number of words following ""walm"" in the input plus one.

"walm -> three repetitions of the previous color.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is used, it is followed by the color word that appeared just before it, repeated three times.",1.0,70,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to the output of repeated ""green"". The number of repetitions appears to be related to the presence of other words, particularly what precedes ""walm"". Here is a breakdown:

- In example 1, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" alone results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which matches the same number of colors as there are characters in ""walm.""
- In example 3, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red.""
- In example 4, ""dax walm"" again results in ""green green green.""
- In example 5, ""dax walm"" again results in ""green green green.""

Considering this pattern, it seems that ""walm"" generates a sequence of the same color, and the color it generates is determined by the preceding word (either ""dax,"" ""wif,"" or alone), and it always produces three repetitions.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> a repetition of three of the color designated by the previous word (or ""yellow"" if there is no word before it).

"Given the examples, each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. ""Dax"" seems to correspond to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Therefore, based on the examples provided, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,71,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""dax"":

- In Example 1, 'dax' corresponds to the color green when following 'wif walm'. However, 'wif walm' without 'dax' results in two reds, so 'dax' is not responsible for the color red.
- In Example 2, 'dax' again corresponds to the color green, this time following a single 'wif'.
- In Example 3, 'dax' is followed by 'lug' and still corresponds to the color green, while 'lug' translates to blue.
- In Example 4, 'dax' at the beginning of the sequence corresponds to green again, followed by a repeated sequence of 'walm wif', which translates to red red each time, and 'zup' at the end translates to yellow.
- In Example 5, when 'dax' stands alone with 'zup', it corresponds to green followed by yellow.

From these examples, we can notice that regardless of the position or the words around it, 'dax' always corresponds to the output color green. There is no instance where 'dax' corresponds to any other color.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,71,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word corresponds to a specific color. The unique word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in the output every time it appears in the input. Therefore, if we were to write this as a rule, it would be:

Rule:
dax -> green",1.0,71,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can infer the color associated with each word, as each word in the input corresponds with a color in the output.

- wif always corresponds with red.
- zup always corresponds with yellow.
- lug always corresponds with blue.
- walm has been seen associated with red as well, but not enough to confirm it as a rule.

Now, let's focus on the word ""dax"" and how it correlates with the output:

- In every example where ""dax"" is present, the first color in the output sequence is green.
- ""dax"" never corresponds to any color other than green in these examples.
- The occurrence of ""dax"" in the input does not seem to affect the color association of the other words that come before or after it.

Given these observations, we can deduce the rule:

dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,71,dax
"Analyzing the given examples:

- ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow""
- ""wif dax wif lug wif"" translates to ""red green red blue red""
- ""zup dax lug zup"" translates to ""yellow green blue yellow""
- ""dax walm wif walm zup"" translates to ""green green green red red red yellow""
- ""dax zup"" translates to ""green yellow""

It appears that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,71,dax
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,71,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" seems to be that it translates to the word ""red"". Here is the deduction:

- In all occurrences of ""wif"", the corresponding output is ""red"".
- ""Wif"" does not seem to depend on context or neighboring words, as it consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position or the words around it.

Hence, the rule is:

wif -> red",1.0,71,wif

"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

- In the first example, ""lug wif lug"" becomes ""blue red blue."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is paired with ""red"" which is between two ""lugs.""
- In the second example, ""dax zup walm wif"" leads to ""green yellow yellow yellow red."" We notice that ""wif"" appears at the end and corresponds to ""red."" We know from the first example that ""lug"" means ""blue,"" but it is not present in this example. However, ""dax"" means ""green"" and ""zup"" and ""walm"" both mean ""yellow."" ""Wif"" is distinct and appears as ""red"" at the end.
- In the third example, ""dax wif zup"" transforms into ""green red yellow."" Here, ""dax"" means ""green,"" ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" means ""red"" again, situated between ""dax"" and ""zup.""
- The fourth example, ""lug wif bluf lug wif,"" becomes ""blue red red blue red."" ""Lug"" remains ""blue,"" ""bluf"" is not defined, but the context suggests it could be ""red"" as well because there's no other color context to associate with ""bluf."" Thus, ""wif"" is still ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug zup wif zup"" translates into ""blue yellow red yellow."" In this case, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is again ""red.""

From these examples, we can determine that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the colors surrounding it.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a repeated sequence of a color, with the quantity and color dependent on the word that comes before it. Specifically:

- ""zup wif walm"" produces ""yellow red red red"". Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""walm"" seems to repeat the color “red” three times.
- ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue"", which means ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeats this color three times.
- ""wif dax zup walm"" creates ""red green yellow yellow yellow"", which suggests ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" repeats the last mentioned color, ""yellow,"" three times here.
- ""zup lug walm wif walm"" yields ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""; ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue"", and the first ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times. The word ""wif"" is ""red"", and the second ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times.
- ""dax lug walm"" produces ""green blue blue blue"", with ""dax"" being ""green,"" ""lug"" as ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeating the color ""blue"" three times, following the ""lug"".

From the above, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the last mentioned word three times. 

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,71,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to result in a sequence of colors being repeated. Observing the pattern, it seems like ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color that comes just before it. Notably, the color doesn't originate from the word ""walm"" itself but from the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Analyzing the examples:

- ""zup wif walm"": ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times.
- ""lug walm"": ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.
- ""wif dax zup walm"": ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times.
- ""zup lug walm wif walm"": ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" ""walm"" following ""lug"" repeats ""blue"" three times. Next, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times.
- ""dax lug walm"": ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be the repetition of the last color mentioned before ""walm,"" repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last mentioned color three times.",1.0,71,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a rule that involves repeating the color associated with the previous word a certain number of times.

In each example, the color output following ""walm"" seems to be directly related to the color associated with the word right before it:

1. ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red"", where ""wif"" seems to correlate to the color red, and ""walm"" leads to it being repeated three times.
2. ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"", suggesting ""lug"" correlates to blue, and ""walm"" repeats it three times.
3. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", where ""zup"" aligns with yellow, and ""walm"" repeats it thrice.

Furthermore, when ""walm"" is used after different words, it still leads to the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word:

4. ""wif dax zup walm"" produces ""red green yellow yellow yellow"", where ""walm"" repeats the preceding yellow three times.
5. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue red red red"", with ""walm"" first repeating the preceding blue three times and then repeating red (preceded by ""wif"") also three times.
6. ""dax lug walm"" yields ""green blue blue blue"", where ""walm"" repeats ""lug""'s blue three times.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times.",1.0,71,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the input-output pairs.

- Input: zup wif walm
  Output: yellow red red red
- Input: lug walm
  Output: blue blue blue
- Input: wif dax zup walm
  Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
- Input: zup lug walm wif walm
  Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
- Input: dax lug walm
  Output: green blue blue blue

Observations:
1. ""walm"" always seems to be associated with a repetition of colors.
2. The number of times the color is repeated corresponds to the number of nonce words before ""walm"" in the sentence.
3. The color that is repeated seems to be determined by the word that immediately precedes ""walm"". For instance:
   - In ""zup wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", so ""walm"" makes ""red"" repeat three times.
   - In ""lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", so ""walm"" makes ""blue"" repeat three times.
4. The sequence of colors before the repetition remains consistent, each unique word translated to a specific color.

Based on these observations, we can extract the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Causes the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word to be repeated the number of times equal to the total count of nonce words preceding ""walm"" in the input sequence.

For example:
- ""lug walm"" -> ""lug"" is blue, and there is one nonce word (""lug"") before ""walm"", so the output is ""blue"" repeated once, giving us ""blue blue blue"".",1.0,71,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe a pattern in which the word ""walm"" generates a repetition of the color associated with the word before it. Here is the breakdown of the examples with their respective color translations:

   (zup corresponds to yellow, wif corresponds to red, walm repeats the color red three times.)

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

3. Input: wif dax zup walm

"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" correlates with a particular color in the output. Each time ""zup"" is an input, ""yellow"" is the corresponding output.

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

"From the provided examples, we can infer the following:

1. When the input ""zup"" occurs by itself, the output is consistently ""yellow.""
2. In sequences with other words, the presence of ""zup"" still results in ""yellow.""

It is not entirely clear what the words ""dax,"" ""walm,"" and ""lug"" mean in this context and whether ""zup"" influences or is influenced by these words. There doesn't appear to be a positional rule or any alteration that depends on adjacent words for ""zup,"" since its output doesn't change regardless of its position. Therefore, it seems that ""zup"" is invariant and always corresponds to the same output.

Rule: zup -> yellow. ""Zup"" means yellow, independent of context or position.",1.0,72,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the instances of ""zup"" consistently result in an output of ""yellow,"" regardless of the surrounding context.

Rule: zup -> yellow. This means that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.",1.0,72,zup
"Based on the given examples, the meaning of ""zup"" seems to be consistent regardless of its position in the sequence.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's first list the corresponding colors for each instance of ""bluf"" in the given examples:

1. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
2. wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow
3. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
4. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
5. lug wif bluf lug wif -> blue red red blue red

We can see that the color after ""bluf"" always matches the color corresponding to the word before it. Here is the breakdown of given examples:

1. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the color after ""bluf"" is ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif.""
2. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the color after ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup.""
3. ""wif"" follows ""bluf"" and the color that follows is ""red,"" corresponding to ""wif.""
4. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the color after ""bluf"" is ""green,"" which corresponds to ""dax.""
5. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the color after ""bluf"" is ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif.""

From the pattern above, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the last color used before it. Therefore, the rule could be considered as follows:

bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word. Rule: The color output for ""bluf"" matches the color output for the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,72,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", we need to look for patterns in the given examples related to the position and presence of ""bluf"" and the corresponding outputs.

1. The output always has one more color than the input has words, suggesting that each word in the input corresponds to a color, and ""bluf"" may represent two colors.

2. ""bluf"" always corresponds to the colors ""red red"" or ""green green"" in the output (two of the same color in a row).

3. ""bluf"" is found between different words in all examples (except the last one, which ends with ""bluf"") and still corresponds to two repeated colors in the output.

4. The color before ""bluf"" is not consistent across the examples, meaning the word that comes before ""bluf"" does not influence the color it represents.

5. When ""bluf"" is at the end of the input, as in example 4, it still results in a double color in the output (""green green"").

6. When ""bluf"" occurs with different words surrounding it, the double color that it represents varies (""yellow red red,"" ""yellow yellow red red red,"" ""yellow green green""). This suggests that the context of the words around ""bluf"" does not affect its output.

By comparing the outputs whenever ""bluf"" is included in the input, the pattern suggests that ""bluf"" corresponds to a repetition of the color represented by the word immediately preceding it in the input.

So, the rule is:

bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word directly before ""bluf"" in the input.

Rule: Repeat the previous color.",1.0,72,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by looking for patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Let's analyze the given examples:

1. Input: zup wif bluf
   - Output: yellow red red

2. Input: wif dax zup bluf
   - Output: red green yellow yellow

3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   - Output: yellow yellow red red red

4. Input: zup dax bluf
   - Output: yellow green green

5. Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
   - Output: blue red red blue red

Examining the colored outputs for each instance of ""bluf"":
- In example 1, after ""bluf"" we see ""red red"".
- In example 2, after ""bluf"" we see ""yellow yellow"".
- In example 3, after ""bluf"" we see ""red red red"".
- In example 4, after ""bluf"" we see ""green"".
- In example 5, after ""bluf"" we see ""red red"".

One potential pattern is that ""bluf"" is followed by a duplication of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf"". However, example 4, where it is followed by ""green"" rather than ""green green"", breaks this pattern. While the rule generally holds up in other examples, example 4 suggests that there may be exceptions to the rule or additional context we are not privy to.

Further analysis is needed to confirm the rule or modify it to account for example 4. Looking at other non-""bluf"" words, we see that:
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

If we strictly follow the pattern of duplication, ""bluf"" translates to ""red red"" when preceded by ""wif,"" to ""yellow yellow"" when preceded by ""zup,"" and to ""blue blue"" when preceded by ""lug.""

However, since example 4 shows ""dax bluf"" translating to ""green"" instead of ""green green,"" it suggests that context matters and ""bluf"" might mirror the preceding word just once if it's preceded by ""dax.""

Therefore, a tentative rule could be:

Rule: ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the word directly before it, unless it's ""dax"" which leads to a single instance of the color.

This pattern could be expressed as:

bluf -> if the preceding word is ""dax,"" the output is ""green""; otherwise, duplicate the color associated with the preceding word.",0.8,72,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the input and output. Let's start by looking for inputs that contain ""bluf"" and noting the associated outputs:

1. Input: zup wif bluf           -> Output: yellow red red
2. Input: wif dax zup bluf       -> Output: red green yellow yellow
3. Input: zup bluf wif walm      -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
4. Input: zup dax bluf           -> Output: yellow green green
5. Input: lug wif bluf lug wif   -> Output: blue red red blue red

Now, let's examine the data to identify what ""bluf"" corresponds to in each output:

1. The word ""bluf"" correlates with the double ""red.""
2. The word ""bluf"" correlates with the double ""yellow.""
3. The word ""bluf"" correlates with the double ""red.""
4. The word ""bluf"" correlates with the double ""green.""
5. The word ""bluf"" correlates with the double ""red.""

So far, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to a double color in the output. However, different instances of ""bluf"" are associated with different colors.

To find a pattern, let's compare other shared pairs in the examples:

- ""wif"" seems to always correspond to ""red.""
- ""zup"" appears to always correspond to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" appears to always correspond to ""green.""

Now, keeping those correlations in mind, let's look specifically at the colors that are doubled when ""bluf"" is in the input:

1. After ""zup"" (yellow) and ""wif"" (red), we have a double ""red.""
2. After ""wif"" (red), ""dax"" (green), and ""zup"" (yellow), we have a double ""yellow.""
3. After ""zup"" (yellow) and before ""wif"" (red) and another word, we have a double ""red.""
4. After ""zup"" (yellow) and ""dax"" (green), we have a double ""green.""
5. ""lug"" does not appear in any other example, but considering the output sequence, it likely correlates to ""blue."" Before and after ""bluf"" are ""lug"" (blue) and ""wif"" (red), resulting in a double ""red.""

It is observed that ""bluf"" may mean to repeat the color immediately preceding it. However, this rule doesn't hold for example 2, where ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) but outputs ""yellow"" twice instead of ""green,"" which precedes it.

The variations impede the development of a clear pattern. The connection between ""bluf"" and the double color appears to stem from the words immediately around ""bluf,"" rather than ""bluf"" itself having an intrinsic color meaning.

To refine the rule considering the anomaly of the second example, we could consider that ""bluf"" might involve repeating the color of the word two places before ""bluf"" if it is not immediately preceded by a color word (which can be the case if ""bluf"" is the last word in the sequence).

With this contingent rule in mind, let's try to reapply it to example 2:

Input: wif (red) dax (green) zup (yellow) bluf
Output: red green yellow (yellow comes from ""zup,"" two places before ""bluf"") yellow

However, without additional examples or clear evidence, this rule is speculative and not robustly supported. More examples or clarification on the nature of the other words (e.g., ""lug"" or ""walm"") in relation to ""bluf"" would be necessary to refine this rule further.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> ""bluf"" seems to cause the repetition of a color, often the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it or under certain conditions, the color of the word two places before it, if the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" is not a color word.",0.6,72,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the corresponding outputs for each input.

1. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
2. wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow
3. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
4. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
5. lug wif bluf lug wif -> blue red red blue red

We will analyze the surrounding words of ""bluf"" to find the correlation:

- When ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"", the color yellow appears before red (yellow red red, yellow yellow red red red, yellow green green). From this, we could initially hypothesize that ""bluf"" correlates with ""red"". However, it's not that straightforward because ""bluf"" appears in the last position in examples 1 and 2 but does not correspond with the same output color, and ""zup"" does not always precede ""bluf"".

- When ""wif"" comes after ""bluf,"" we get the sequence red red. However, in example 5, the presence of ""wif"" after ""bluf"" changes the sequence (red red blue red), making it clear that ""wif"" after ""bluf"" does not consistently result in ""red red.""

- In example 3, ""wif"" comes after ""bluf"" and we get a sequence of yellow yellow and then red red red, suggesting that ""bluf"" might not have a fixed color representation but depends on the context of surrounding words.

- Example 4, zup dax bluf -> yellow green green, indicates that ""bluf"" might have a meaning of ""green"" when preceded by ""dax,"" but this is inconsistent with the outputs of ""bluf"" in other examples.

- Example 5 is a sequence where ""lug"" borders ""bluf"" resulting in (blue red red blue red). This doesn't provide a clear correlation either since the output ""red red"" doesn't pair exclusively with ""bluf.""

The inconsistencies in these examples do not provide a definitive rule for ""bluf"" based on the position or surrounding words alone. Instead, ""bluf"" may have a meaning associated not with a specific word but with the pattern and combination of words that appear around it.

Given the variability, we have to consider that ""bluf"" does not stand for a single color but changes depending on the word combination in each input. There does, however, appear to be a trend related to ""bluf"" and the output ""red."" When ""bluf"" occurs, ""red"" tends to follow, although not consistently in terms of sequence.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" likely alters its meaning depending on the words or sequence of words that come before or after it. It correlates with ""red"" in multiple instances, but not exclusively or consistently enough to conclude a direct translation to ""red"" without more examples or additional rules to specify the conditions under which ""bluf"" results in ""red"" or other colors. Since we don't have a consistent rule, the best we can say is that ""bluf"" has an output that seems to be context-dependent. More data is needed to formulate an exact rule.",0.3,72,bluf
"Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the previous word three times. 

Examples supporting this rule:

- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" (the color associated with ""lug"") three times.
- ""dax walm wif walm"" translates to ""green green green red red red,"" where ""walm"" first repeats ""green"" (the color associated with ""dax"") three times, and then it repeats ""red"" (the color associated with ""wif"") three times.
- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue,"" where ""walm"" immediately follows ""lug"" and repeats ""blue"" three times, with subsequent color mappings following their respective words.

Therefore:

"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following:

1. ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"" which suggests that ""walm"" translates to three repetitions of the color associated with the word before it.
2. ""dax walm wif walm"" matches ""green green green red red red"" which reinforces the rule that ""walm"" repeats the color preceding it three times.
3. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue,"" where after ""lug walm,"" we have ""wif"" followed by ""lug bluf"" resulting in ""red blue blue,"" aligning with the rest.
4. ""lug walm"" on its own produces ""blue blue blue"" consistently with previous examples.
5. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue"" where ""lug walm"" yields ""blue blue blue,"" and the rest of the sequence matches color words not associated with ""walm"" directly.

- ""dax walm wif walm"" gives ""green green green red red red"", where both ""dax"" and ""wif"" seem to correspond to ""green"" and ""red"" respectively, and ""walm"" again signifies a repetition of the preceding color three times.

- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue blue"", again showing that ""walm"" repeats the preceding color three times, and ""wif"" seems to mean ""red"" based on prior examples, while ""bluf"" seems to be another way to say ""blue"" (likely ""bluf"" -> ""blue"").

- ""lug walm"" simply repeats the same as the first example, reinforcing the rule.

- ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" transforms into ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue"" where new words ""zup"" and ""dax"" are introduced. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green"" based on this sequence, and ""walm"" again repeats ""blue"" three times after ""lug"".

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I'll analyze the relationship between the inputs and the outputs. Here's the breakdown:

Input: wif dax lug walm
Output: red green blue blue blue
- The word 'walm' follows 'lug' and the corresponding output is 'blue blue blue,' which suggests that 'walm' could be related to repeating the color associated with the word that comes right before it.

Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue
- Again, 'walm' follows 'lug,' and the output is 'blue blue.' This reinforces the idea that 'walm' is causing a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- 'Walm' follows 'wif' first and the output is 'red red red,' again suggesting repetition of the color associated with 'wif.' The second 'walm' follows 'zup' and the output is 'yellow yellow yellow.'

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- 'Walm' follows 'dax,' resulting in 'green green green'; further supporting the repetition rule.

Input: dax zup walm wif walm
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
- 'Walm' follows 'zup' and leads to 'yellow yellow yellow' and then it follows 'wif' and leads to 'red red red,' which again implies repetition.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that the word ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color output of the word that immediately precedes it, three times.

Rule: walm -> The nonce word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat three times.",1.0,73,walm
"To figure out the rule for ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples. We will look at the words preceding ""walm"" and the colors they correspond to:

1. In ""wif dax lug walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Since ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in triple ""blue,"" it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color of the directly preceding word.

2. In ""dax lug dax lug walm,"" following this pattern, ""walm"" would repeat the color of ""lug,"" resulting in double ""blue,"" and that is consistent with the output.

3. In ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" resulting in triple ""red,"" following the established pattern. The second ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" resulting in triple ""yellow,"" further affirming the pattern.

4. In ""dax walm wif,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax"" with a corresponding color ""green,"" and it results in double ""green,"" once again consistent with the pattern.

5. In ""dax zup walm wif walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and produces triple ""yellow."" The second ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and results in triple ""red,"" which maintains the pattern.

Based on these observations, we can induce the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning: Repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it three times.",1.0,73,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the provided examples:

1. wif dax lug walm -> red green blue blue blue
2. dax lug dax lug walm -> green blue green blue blue blue
3. wif walm zup lug zup walm -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
4. dax walm wif -> green green green red
5. dax zup walm wif walm -> green yellow yellow yellow red red red

Observing the outputs, we notice patterns dependent on the presence of ""walm"". It seems that ""walm"" triggers repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. In example 1, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and following ""walm"", we see ""blue blue blue"". Similarly, in example 4, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""walm"", it results in ""green green green"".

Let's validate this with each example:

1. ""lug"" (blue) precedes ""walm"", so the output after ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue"".
2. ""lug"" (blue) precedes ""walm"", so the output after ""walm"" is ""blue blue"".
3. ""wif"" (red) is directly followed by ""walm"", resulting in ""red red red"". Then ""zup"" (yellow) is repeated after the second ""walm"".
4. ""dax"" (green) precedes ""walm"", thus ""green green green"".
5. ""zup"" (yellow) precedes the first ""walm"", then ""wif"" (red) precedes the second ""walm"", each time the colors are repeated.

Based on these patterns, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color corresponding to the word just before it, three times if the word is at the start of the sequence, or two times if it is in the middle or at the end.

Rule: walm -> ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. If ""walm"" occurs after the first word in the sequence, repeat the color three times; if ""walm"" occurs at any other position, repeat the color two times.",0.9,73,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" refers to a repeating sequence of the previously mentioned color(s) in the pattern. The exact rule seems to depend on the color that comes before ""walm."" Here’s the rule deduced from the examples:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the sequence of colors that come before it, starting from the last color mentioned, and repeat the sequence that many times again as there are colors in the sequence.

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color blue. Since blue is the only color mentioned before ""walm,"" it is repeated three times (because the sequence contains one color).
- In the second example, ""lug"" (blue) precedes ""walm,"" and the sequence prior to it is ""green blue."" Hence, ""walm"" results in ""blue blue,"" doubling the sequence because there are two colors in the sequence.
- In the third example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and is the last color before the second ""walm."" The sequence ""red yellow"" is repeated twice (four times in total) because the sequence contains two colors.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), so it repeats green three times, once for the single color in the sequence.
- In the fifth example, the last color before the first ""walm"" is yellow (from ""zup""), so ""walm"" repeats it three times because it alone forms the sequence. After ""wif"" (red), the second ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times, once for each color in the new sequence.

To clarify the repetition pattern, consider the first ""walm"" in the fifth input (""dax zup walm wif walm""):

- ""dax"" (green)
- ""zup"" (yellow)
- ""walm"" should repeat the sequence ""green yellow"", but since ""zup"" is the last color, ""yellow"" gets repeated three times (because it's the only color in the sequence).

Then for ""wif"" (red) followed by ""walm,"" it should repeat:

- ""wif"" (red)
- ""walm"" repeats the sequence ""red"" three times (because it's the only color in the new sequence).

Hence, ""walm"" acts as a command to duplicate the immediate preceding pattern of colors a number of times equal to the number of distinct colors in that pattern.",0.8,73,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,74,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" we should analyze the given examples and see how the output changes based on the presence of ""lug.""

In the first example, ""dax lug walm"" maps to ""green blue blue blue."" It is noted that ""dax"" alone maps to ""green,"" and ""walm"" we can deduce maps to ""blue"" (we can tell because ""walm"" appears multiple times always followed by blue).

In the second example, ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm,"" ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""walm"" continues to map to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Here ""lug walm"" maps to ""blue blue blue,"" indicating ""lug"" might have an effect of repeating the color of the next word three times.

In the second example, ""zup wif lug,"" ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" is followed by ""blue,"" which does not follow the previously deduced pattern.

Looking more closely, wherever ""lug"" appears, the word immediately following it is ""walm"" except in the last two examples. There, ""lug"" is followed by the color ""blue."" The pattern could suggest that ""lug"" causes the next word to map to its color output three times or, more specifically, perhaps ""lug"" means to triplicate the color output of the subsequent word.

Let's test this hypothesis with the fourth example, ""zup lug dax."" If ""lug"" causes the next word to triplicate its output color, we would expect ""zup"" to not apply since it is before ""lug,"" and ""dax"" which follows ""lug"" should be triplicated. However, the output does not confirm this as it's ""yellow blue green."" 

Similarly, the fifth input ""dax zup lug"" produces ""green yellow blue,"" which doesn't support the above-stated hypothesis either but does provide another piece of evidence – ""lug"" results in the color blue, regardless of the following word.

Given this information:
- ""lug"" does not triplicate the color output of the word that follows it.
- ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue.""

Therefore, the most consistent rule that can be deduced from the given examples is that ""lug"" translates directly to the color ""blue,"" regardless of position in the sequence or the word that follows.

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,74,lug
"By examining the examples provided and their corresponding outputs, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug."" 

First, we need to identify the pattern by looking at the context in which ""lug"" appears and the resulting outputs:

1. dax lug walm —> green blue blue blue
    - Here, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of ""blue."" However, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm —> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
    - In this example, ""lug"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""walm."" The sequence of ""red"" repeats until ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which results in ""blue blue blue.""

3. zup wif lug —> yellow red blue
    - In this example, ""lug"" is preceded by both ""zup"" and ""wif,"" and the only word after it is ""blue,"" which seems to be the contribution of ""lug.""

4. zup lug dax —> yellow blue green
    - Here, ""lug"" is in-between ""zup"" and ""dax,"" with the corresponding output being ""yellow blue green."" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""lug"" seems to contribute the ""blue.""

5. dax zup lug —> green yellow blue
    - Similar to the previous examples, ""lug"" follows ""dax"" and ""zup"" and the corresponding colors are ""green,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue,"" respectively.

From these examples, it seems that the common factor when ""lug"" appears is the color ""blue."" To further establish this association, we can note that in every instance where ""lug"" is used, no matter what the preceding or following words are, the output includes ""blue."" This ""blue"" is not attributed elsewhere to other words, so we can deduce that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

- When ""lug"" appears after ""wif,"" which is associated with red, the output is blue.

Regardless of the word that precedes ""lug"", the output for ""lug"" is always blue. Therefore, we can deduce that ""lug"" does not change its meaning based on context and is consistently represented by the color blue.

Other words in the input correspond to other colors in the output, but the rule regarding ""dax"" is consistent across all examples.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,74,dax
"The nonce word dax seems to be translated into the color ""green"" in each of the given examples. Here's how I derived at the rule:

- In the first example, ""dax wif"" results in ""green red"". Considering ""dax"" is the first word and ""green"" is the first color in the output, it most likely that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

- In the second example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"". Since ""walm"" doesn't appear in any of the other inputs, it's not immediately clear what corresponds to “green” in the triad ""green green green"". However, given the previous association of ""dax"" with ""green"", it's reasonable to assume that ""dax"" remains ""green"" and ""walm"" is also encoded as ""green"".

- In the third example, ""lug dax"" results in ""blue green"", and ""lug"" by itself is associated with ""blue"" in another example. Therefore, ""dax"" remains consistent with the color ""green"".

- In the fifth example, ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" results in ""yellow green yellow green red red"". ""Zup"" seems to translate to ""yellow"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""bluf"" possibly to another ""red"" (since ""bluf"" doesn't appear in any other examples, this association is more uncertain). The consistent element is that ""dax"" continues to correspond to ""green"".

With the repetition of ""dax"" consistently leading to ""green"" in different contexts and the other words seemingly translating to other colors, the rule appears to be:

dax -> ""green"".",1.0,74,dax

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" I will look at the instances in which it appears and the corresponding output it generates:

1. ""dax wif"" results in ""green red,"" where ""green"" is associated with ""dax"" and ""red"" is associated with ""wif.""
2. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" where ""green"" appears three times, suggesting that ""walm"" may cause repetition of the color associated with ""dax.""
3. ""dax lug dax wif dax"" results in ""green blue green red green."" Here, ""green"" appears around ""lug"" and ""wif,"" with ""blue"" associated with ""lug"" and ""red"" with ""wif."" Each ""dax"" results in a ""green.""
4. ""lug dax"" results in ""blue green."" Again, ""green"" follows ""dax,"" suggesting a correlation.
5. ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" results in ""yellow green yellow green red red."" Here, ""yellow"" appears to be associated with ""zup,"" whereas ""green"" consistently follows ""dax.""

From these examples, it is possible to induce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of the context in which it is used.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,74,dax
"Based on the examples given, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" The other words also seem to have a one-to-one correspondence with specific colors: ""lug"" with ""blue,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" ""walm"" with ""yellow,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""bluf"" with ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: ""wif"" consistently means ""red.""",1.0,74,wif
"Given the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the output includes the color ""red."" 

The other words in the examples appear to correspond to different colors as well: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" also corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Additionally, ""bluf"" could correspond to ""red,"" given that it appears once in the input paired with ""wif"" and the output is ""red red.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be that each unique nonce word represents a specific color in the output:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,74,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" Here's the mapping derived from the given inputs and outputs:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> yellow
- dax -> green
- bluf -> red (assuming there is no typographical error in the seed examples)

Rule: ""wif"" means ""red"".",1.0,74,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the meaning or rule associated with the word ""wif."" Here's the pattern that emerges from the examples:

- When ""wif"" appears on its own, the output is ""red.""
- The word ""lug"" appears after ""wif"" in three examples, and the sequence ""wif lug"" always translates to ""red blue.""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow."" When ""zup"" precedes ""wif,"" the output is ""yellow red.""
- ""dax"" appears only once, in sequence with ""wif lug,"" and the output sequence includes ""green"" following ""wif,"" which is ""red."" So, it seems that ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- ""bluf"" appears once as well, following ""wif,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""

Given the constancy of the output for ""wif,"" the examples suggest the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" within the context of these examples is:

wif -> red",1.0,74,wif
"Based on the given examples, each instance of a word translates consistently to a color. The word wif consistently translates to the color red. Therefore, the meaning of the nonce word wif in this context can be established as red.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,74,wif
"To deduce the rule for what ""zup"" means, let's look at the provided examples and their respective outputs. We'll follow the pattern of associating each input with the corresponding color in the output.

- In the first example, ""zup"" appears between ""bluf"" and ""wif,"" and in the output, ""yellow"" appears between ""red"" and ""red."" So, potentially ""zup"" could translate to ""yellow.""

- In the second example, ""zup"" comes after ""wif"" and before another ""wif,"" corresponding to ""yellow"" coming after ""red"" and before another ""red."" This seems to support our initial hypothesis.

- In the third example, ""zup"" is before ""dax"" and ""wif,"" lining up with ""yellow"" being before ""green"" and ""red."" This is consistent with the hypothesis.

- In the fourth example, ""zup"" appears twice, first before ""dax"" and ""bluf wif,"" and then again before ""bluf lug."" The output has ""yellow"" in both places where ""zup"" appears, once before ""green green red"" and then again before ""yellow blue."" This matches what we've seen so far.

- In the fifth example, ""zup"" is between ""dax"" and ""walm,"" and in the output, ""yellow"" is between ""green"" and ""yellow yellow."" The instance of ""zup"" here does not immediately follow ""wif,"" and yet is still translated as ""yellow.""

From these examples, it seems that ""zup"" doesn't depend on the context of the words that come before or after it in any of the cases—it is always translated as ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the string. Thus the rule appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,74,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Explanation: In all the examples given, whenever 'zup' appears in the input, 'yellow' appears in the corresponding position in the output. Regardless of the position of 'zup' within the sequence or the terms that precede or follow it, the output is consistently 'yellow'. Therefore, the meaning of 'zup' appears to translate directly to the color 'yellow'.",1.0,74,zup
"Observing the patterns in the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Whenever the term ""zup"" is used in the input, ""yellow"" is used in the same position in the output. There doesn't appear to be a context-dependent rule based on the examples given; it seems to directly translate every time it is used.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,74,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup."" Let's examine each input-output pair to uncover this pattern:

Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif  
Output: red green red red yellow red  
- Every ""wif"" is translating to ""red."" ""Dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""red."" When ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""

Input: wif zup wif dax  
Output: red yellow red green  
- Following the pattern, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green."" Here ""zup"" is also translating to ""yellow.""

Input: zup dax wif  
Output: yellow green red  
- ""Dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug  
Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue  
- ""Dax"" is ""green,"" ""bluf"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

Input: lug wif dax zup walm  
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow  
- ""Lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" ""Walm"" does not translate directly, but given that all appearances are followed by ""yellow,"" it suggests a correlation.

From the patterns above, it is evident that regardless of its position in the input, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" within the given context is directly translated to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,74,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that zup has a consistent output in the pattern, regardless of its position or occurrences. So, we can hypothesize the following rule:

In every example, zup corresponds to the output ""yellow."" It does not appear to alter based on its position or the words surrounding it. Therefore, we can conclude that zup equates to the color yellow in the given context.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,74,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns related to the word ""bluf"" across the examples given.

1. Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green
2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
3. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
4. Input: wif lug zup bluf -> Output: red blue yellow yellow
5. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red

Looking at these examples, we can infer the following for each input:
- Example 1: ""bluf"" follows two words (""zup"" and ""dax"") that produce two different colors (yellow and green), and the output for ""bluf"" is the color green, which is the color of the word that immediately precedes it.
- Example 2: ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" again and the output is yellow, which is the same as ""zup.""
- Example 3: ""bluf"" is after ""lug,"" and the output is blue, which is the same as ""lug.""
- Example 4: ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" again and the output is yellow once more, following the same pattern of matching the color of the preceding word.
- Example 5: ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is red, which is the same color as ""wif.""

Given these observations, the rule seems consistent:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. 

Thus, the definition can be written as:
bluf -> meaning. The meaning is to repeat the color of the previously mentioned word.",1.0,74,bluf
"By analyzing the patterns of the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" Let's look at the occurrences of ""bluf"" and what output it generates in each context:

1. ""zup dax bluf"" yields ""yellow green green"" – ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green.""
2. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" yields ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue"" – ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow.""
3. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" yields ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"" – ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the output is ""red.""
4. ""wif lug zup bluf"" yields ""red blue yellow yellow"" – ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow.""
5. ""wif bluf"" yields ""red red"" – ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red.""

From these examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. If ""dax"" is represented by green, ""bluf"" after ""dax"" turns green. Similarly, if ""zup"" is represented by yellow, ""bluf"" after ""zup"" turns yellow, and if ""wif"" or ""lug"" are represented by red, ""bluf"" after them turns red.

Rule: bluf -> the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,74,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color output. Specifically, after examining each case, we can see that ""bluf"" always corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Additionally, other words seem to consistently correspond to other colors as well. Let's formalize this analysis:

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""blue"" and ""green"" respectively.
- For the third example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" so it should correspond to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" as well.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

With this pattern, we can say that ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs.

Rule: bluf -> yellow.",1.0,74,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs:

- In every instance, when the word ""bluf"" appears, the color ""green"" appears in the output.
- However, ""bluf"" results in a different number of ""green"" occurrences depending on its position and the surrounding context.
  
Now, let's check ""bluf"" against other words:

1. Every time ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow green green.""
2. When ""bluf"" stands alone or is not preceded by ""zup,"" the output is simply ""red red"" or includes a single ""green,"" as seen in the other examples.

Given these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" itself translates to ""green,"" but its output can be influenced by the preceding word. Specifically, when it follows ""zup,"" it results in two instances of ""green"" in the output.

Rule: bluf -> ""green,"" with the rule being that if ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output contains two greens instead of one.",0.9,74,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""yellow"" when it appears in the output. Therefore:

Rule: bluf -> yellow.",0.0,74,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it multiple times. To validate this, we can analyze the first items in each sequence and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""zup wif dax walm"" leads to ""yellow red green green green."" Here, ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and then ""green"" is repeated three times.

2. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" leads to ""blue blue blue green red blue red."" In this example, ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" ""blue"" is outputted multiple times until another color is introduced.

3. ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" leads to ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue."" The first ""walm"" sequence comes after a ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" so ""red"" is repeated. The second ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and so ""blue"" is repeated.

4. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""yellow"" is outputted three times.

5. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" leads to ""yellow red green green green blue."" After ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""walm"" leads to ""green"" being repeated before a new color is introduced with ""lug.""

The number of repetitions can vary, but the pattern shows that ""walm"" causes the last color mentioned to be repeated in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the color corresponding to the previous word in the output.",1.0,74,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze how it affects the output in each example:

Input: zup wif dax walm
Output: yellow red green green green

In this sequence, ""walm"" generates three instances of ""green"" after ""dax.""

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

After ""lug,"" ""walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue."" 

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

Here, ""walm"" after ""wif"" again leads to three instances of ""red,"" and after ""lug"" to ""blue blue blue.""

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

In isolation after ""zup,"" ""walm"" results in three instances of ""yellow.""

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue

The ""walm"" here follows the same pattern after ""dax,"" resulting in three ""green"" followed by a color related to the next word (""lug -> blue"").

From these examples, we can deduce a pattern:

1. ""Walm"" after ""zup"" results in three instances of the color ""yellow.""
2. ""Walm"" after ""wif"" results in three instances of the color ""red.""
3. ""Walm"" after ""dax"" results in three instances of the color ""green.""
4. ""Walm"" after ""lug"" results in three instances of the color ""blue.""

It appears that ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color connected to the preceding word three times. The rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes the color produced by the previous word in the sequence and repeats it three times.

Rule: 

walm -> Repeats the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,74,walm
"Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times. 

In all the examples provided, the word that appears after ""walm"" leads to three repetitions of the color that is associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Based on the examples:

- In ""zup wif dax walm"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which corresponds to the color green, so the output is ""green green green.""
- In ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"", ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which corresponds to the color blue, so the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"", there are two instances of ""walm"":
  - The first ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which corresponds to the color red, leading to the output ""red red red.""
  - The second ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which corresponds to the color blue, leading to the output ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""zup walm"", ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to the color yellow, so the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In ""zup wif dax walm lug"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which corresponds to the color green, so the output is ""green green green.""

Therefore, we can formulate the following rule:
walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",1.0,74,walm
"Given the examples, let's examine the outputs associated with ""walm"" in each line:

1. ""zup wif dax walm"" -> Output: yellow red green green green
2. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" -> Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
3. ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" -> Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
4. ""zup walm"" -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
5. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> Output: yellow red green green green blue

In each example where ""walm"" is used, the sequence of colors that follow it is green repeated one or more times. It is also noticeable that ""walm"" does not directly correspond to the same single color each time. Instead, its output seems to be a function of the color sequence.

Now let's apply the rule to each specific instance to see if there's a consistent pattern:

1. ""zup wif dax walm"" -> yellow red green (walm causes the next color to repeat)
2. ""lug walm dax wif"" -> blue (before walm) blue (after walm, blue repeats) green (different color)
3. ""wif walm dax"" -> red (before walm) red (after walm, red repeats) green (different color)
4. ""zup walm"" -> yellow (before walm) yellow yellow (after walm, yellow repeats twice)
5. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> yellow red green (walm causes the next color to repeat) blue (color after the repeated sequence)

Based on this, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color immediately after it to be repeated one or more times.

Rule: walm -> causes the next color to repeat.",0.8,74,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by looking at the patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs.

Here are the observations:
- Whenever ""walm"" is in the input, the word ""green"" is repeated in the output.
- The instances of the word ""green"" directly correspond to the position of ""walm"" in the input.
- The number of ""green"" words in the output matches the total number of words before ""walm"" in the input, not including ""walm"" itself.

Examples analyzed:
1. ""zup wif dax walm"" maps to ""yellow red green green green"": here, ""walm"" follows three words, resulting in three instances of ""green.""
2. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" maps to ""blue blue blue green red blue red"": ""walm"" follows one word, hence there is one ""green"" in the output.
3. ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" maps to ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue"": ""walm"" follows two instances, first after one word, then after three words, showing one and three ""green"" instances in the output respectively.
4. ""zup walm"" maps to ""yellow yellow yellow"": ""walm"" follows one word which gives us three ""yellow"" in the output, signaling a slight deviation in the rule as it's a series of ""yellow"" instead of ""green"". This might imply that ""walm"" repeating the color of the previous word if it's the second word in the input.
5. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" maps to ""yellow red green green green blue"": ""walm"" follows three words again, with three ""green"" instances.

From the examples above, we can infer the rule for ""walm"".

Rule: ""walm"" -> The appearance of ""walm"" in the input results in the repetition of the word ""green"" in the output, the number of times being equal to the number of words preceding ""walm,"" not including ""walm"" itself.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze the patterns related to its appearance and the corresponding output colors:

1. Every instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green.""
2. ""Dax"" appears in various contexts (beginning, middle, end of sequences) and still outputs ""green.""

Given these observations, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green

The meaning of ""dax"" is that it always corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,75,dax
"Based on the examples provided and the respective outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""dax"" and other words by finding patterns. Here's how the rule induction might work:

- The word ""lug"" in the input corresponds with ""blue"" in the output.
- The word ""wif"" in the input corresponds with ""red"" in the output.
- The word ""zup"" in the input corresponds with ""yellow"" in the output.
- It also seems that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the input words and the output colors, regardless of their order.

Considering this, we can induce that each word translates to a color, and ""dax"" specifically translates to ""green.""

Rule: Each unique word is associated with a specific color in the output. ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color ""green.""",1.0,75,dax

- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""

- ""wif dax"" -> ""red green""

We can infer that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" in the output, regardless of what precedes or follows it. 

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

wif -> red

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the relationship between the inputs and the outputs in each example:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the output is always a pair of identical colors.
- The color that appears twice is not immediately obvious from the word ""bluf"" alone since different colors appear across examples.
- The color that appears twice seems to depend on the preceding word in the input sequence.

Now let's look for patterns that correspond with the presence of ""bluf"":

1. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""
   ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and after ""bluf"" we see ""yellow"" is repeated.

2. ""lug wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue red blue blue""
   ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and after ""bluf,"" we see ""blue"" is repeated.

3. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
   ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and after ""bluf,"" we see ""green"" is repeated.

4. ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow green yellow green red red""
   ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" we see ""red"" is repeated.

5. ""dax lug wif bluf"" -> ""green blue red red""
   ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" we see ""red"" is repeated.

In each case, the color that is duplicated following ""bluf"" is the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""

Rule: ""bluf"" in the input causes the output to repeat the color that corresponds to the word that comes immediately before ""bluf.""

Thus, the induction based on the provided examples is:

"Based on the provided examples, we can determine a pattern for the output corresponding to each input that contains the nonce word ""bluf.""

- The presence of ""bluf"" in the input results in a duplicated word in the output.
- The word that is duplicated (red or blue) corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" in the input (wif->red, lug->blue).
- No other words seem to pair with ""bluf"" to generate a duplication effect (e.g., ""dax"" does not cause duplication when followed by ""bluf"").
- The color associated with ""bluf"" does not appear to be dependent on its absolute position in the input sentence, but rather on its relative position to the preceding word.

Therefore, the rule associated with the word ""bluf"" seems to be that it causes the color that corresponds to the immediately preceding word to be repeated in the output.

Rule: bluf -> causes the duplication of the color associated with the word immediately before it in the output.",1.0,75,bluf
"The examples provided suggest that each word corresponds to a color and that the word ""bluf"" results in a repetition of the color indicated by the penultimate (second to last) word in the sequence. Let's examine the patterns:

1. The word ""wif"" corresponds to red since ""zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow red red red,"" with ""wif"" coming before ""bluf"" and ""red red"" following ""bluf"".

2. The word ""lug"" corresponds to blue since ""lug wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue blue,"" meaning ""bluf"" takes the color of the penultimate word ""lug"" and gives ""blue"".

3. The word ""dax"" corresponds to green because ""dax bluf"" converts to ""green green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" mimics the color of the preceding word ""dax"".

4. For the input ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf,"" the output is ""yellow green yellow green red red,"" which means ""bluf"" takes the color from the penultimate word ""wif"" resulting in ""red red.""

5. Finally, ""dax lug wif bluf"" produces ""green blue red red,"" so again ""bluf"" repeats the color of the penultimate word ""wif"" as ""red red.""

Based on these patterns, we can determine the following rule:

bluf -> Repeats the color indicated by the penultimate word in the sequence.

Rule: ""bluf"" outputs the color corresponding to the second to the last word that appears before it in the sequence, and this color is repeated once.",1.0,75,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red red

Based on the examples provided, every time the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output consistently ends with ""red red,"" regardless of the other words present. This suggests that the rule for ""bluf"" is that it translates directly to ""red red"" in the output.",1.0,75,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we must look for patterns in each example.

1. The output ""yellow yellow red red red"" corresponds to ""zup bluf wif walm."" When ""bluf"" is present, there are two colors that correspond to the one word ""bluf.""

2. In ""lug wif lug bluf,"" the output is ""blue red blue blue."" Here ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""

3. ""Dax bluf"" has the output ""green green,"" indicating ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

4. ""Zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" gives ""yellow green yellow green red red."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red red.""

5. ""Dax lug wif bluf"" has the output ""green blue red red."" In this example, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red red.""

From these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" doubles the color that is associated with the last unique word before ""bluf."" In examples 2 and 3, the word before ""bluf"" is ""lug"" and ""dax,"" corresponding to ""blue"" and ""green,"" respectively. In examples 1, 4, and 5, the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color ""red."" Thus, the output for ""bluf"" is always two instances of the color tied to the previous word.

Rule: bluf -> The color associated with the previous unique word is repeated once (if the word before ""bluf"" corresponds to ""color X,"" then ""bluf"" outputs ""color X color X"").",0.8,75,bluf
"walm -> repeated color of the word immediately preceding it

Rule: ""walm"" takes the color of the word immediately before it and repeats it three times. For example, if the word before ""walm"" is ""zup"" (which outputs ""yellow""), then ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". If the word before ""walm"" is ""lug"" (which outputs ""blue""), then ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"". If the word before ""walm"" is ""dax"" (which outputs ""green""), then ""walm"" results in ""green green green"".",1.0,75,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. By examining these pairs, we can discern a possible rule for the word ""walm.""

- In the first input ""zup wif walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the output features ""red"" repeated thrice after the initial colors. This suggests that ""walm"" is causing a repetition of the color word that comes just before it.

- In the second input ""zup lug walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and following this, ""blue"" is repeated thrice. This supports the initial observation that ""walm"" repeats the color word preceding it three times.

- In the third input ""wif zup lug dax zup walm,"" we can match ""wif"" with ""red,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""dax"" with ""green."" ""Zup"" precedes ""walm"" and in the output, ""yellow"" is repeated three times after the sequence. This further reinforces the rule we are deducing.

- In the fourth input ""wif lug dax walm,"" we have ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""green"" corresponding to ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax,"" respectively. ""Green"" is then repeated thrice, a pattern consistent with the previous examples.

- In the fifth input ""dax walm lug,"" we see ""green"" corresponding to ""dax,"" and after ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated thrice before ending with ""blue"" for ""lug.""

All these examples consistently show that ""walm"" repeats the color word that comes just before it three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> causes the immediate preceding color word to be repeated three times in the output.",1.0,75,walm
"To deduce what ""walm"" means, let's analyze the patterns associated with the output colors for each input containing ""walm.""

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output color is red.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output color is blue.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output color is green.
- Whether ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" directly or not, the output color after ""walm"" is not consistently yellow but instead follows the pattern of the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

It seems that ""walm"" takes its meaning from the word that precedes it directly, repeating the associated color of that input word. Thus:

- ""walm"" after ""wif"" -> red red red
- ""walm"" after ""lug"" -> blue blue blue
- ""walm"" after ""dax"" -> green green green

The rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it copies the color associated with the immediately preceding word and repeats it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.",1.0,75,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to determine the repeated color in the output. The color that repeats is the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm.""

Here's the breakdown:
- In the first example, ""wif"" comes before ""walm"" and the color ""red"" repeats.
- In the second example, ""lug"" comes before ""walm"" and the color ""blue"" repeats.
- In the third example, ""zup"" comes before ""walm"" and the color ""yellow"" repeats.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" comes before ""walm"" and the color ""green"" repeats.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" comes before ""walm"" again and the color ""green"" repeats.

Thus, the implicit meaning of ""walm"" is that it indicates repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat.",1.0,75,walm
"From the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by looking at the patterns and the associated outputs. Let's investigate each input and its corresponding output:

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
Analysis: walm follows wif, which corresponds to the color red, and the output is three reds following one yellow (which corresponds to zup).

Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue
Analysis: walm follows lug, which corresponds to the color blue, and the output is three blues following one yellow.

Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
Analysis: walm here seems to be following zup, corresponding to yellow, but it's notable that the preceding colors occur once before the sequence of yellows.

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green
Analysis: walm follows dax, which corresponds to the color green, and the output is three greens after the other colors are mentioned once each.

Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue
Analysis: walm follows dax again, with the output being three greens and then a blue corresponding to lug, coming after walm this time.

Rule:
Based on the pattern in the examples, ""walm"" seems to result in three repetitions of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm"". If a word has an associated color, ""walm"" seems to triple that color in the output, regardless of other colors that follow in the input.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word three times.",0.8,75,walm
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,76,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word 'lug' appears in the input, it corresponds to the color blue in the output.",1.0,76,lug

"lug -> blue

"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the outputs provided.",1.0,76,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce what ""dax"" means by discerning a pattern associated with its occurrence and the corresponding output colors. 

1. ""Input: dax wif walm"" results in ""Output: green red red red."" The word ""dax"" yields a ""green"" output.
2. ""Input: dax zup dax walm"" results in ""Output: green yellow green green green."" The first and third occurrences of ""dax"" yield a ""green"" output.
3. ""Input: dax"" results in ""Output: green."" The single occurrence of ""dax"" yields a ""green"" output.
4. ""Input: dax lug dax lug wif"" results in ""Output: green blue green blue red."" The first and third occurrences of ""dax"" yield a ""green"" output.
5. ""Input: dax"" results in ""Output: green."" The single occurrence of ""dax"" yields a ""green"" output.

Every time the word ""dax"" occurs, no matter the context, it consistently corresponds to a ""green"" output. Therefore, for purposes of this exercise, ""dax"" could be represented as a symbol or concept that translates to ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,76,dax
"dax -> green. Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.",1.0,76,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at each example and the corresponding output:

1. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   - ""dax"" results in ""green,"" while the other words lead to ""red.""

2. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   - When ""dax"" is repeated after another word, ""zup,"" it results in a sequence where ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and both instances of ""dax"" following it are ""green.""

3. Input: dax
   Output: green
   - ""dax"" on its own results in ""green.""

4. Input: dax lug dax lug wif

5. Input: dax
   Output: green
   - ""dax"" on its own again results in ""green.""

From these observations, the rule seems to be:

dax -> green.",1.0,76,dax
"dax -> green

Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that every instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds with the output ""green."" Thus, ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, the output is ""green.""",1.0,76,dax
"To deduce the rule for the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze the pattern in the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax wif walm -> Output: green red red red
2. Input: dax zup dax walm -> Output: green yellow green green green
3. Input: dax -> Output: green
4. Input: dax lug dax lug wif -> Output: green blue green blue red
5. Input: dax -> Output: green

From these examples, we can infer the following:

- Every time the input starts with ""dax,"" the output starts with ""green.""
- ""dax"" by itself always results in ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by another occurrence of ""dax,"" both instances result in ""green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" gets the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
- When ""dax"" is followed by different words (""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""walm""), the output colors change (red, yellow, blue, green), suggesting that ""dax"" does not alter the colors of the following words.
- The colors associated with other words are consistent across examples (""wif"" is always followed by ""red,"" ""lug"" by ""blue,"" and ""walm"" by ""green""), indicating that ""dax"" has no effect on the color associated with these words.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude the rule for ""dax"":

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" irrespective of its position or the presence of other words. The word ""dax"" by itself or following another ""dax"" will always result in the color ""green.""",0.9,76,dax

- ""wif"" -> red
- ""walm"" -> red
- ""zup"" -> yellow

It's important to note that ""walm"" and ""wif"" both map to ""red"" in the output, which could indicate that there are multiple words in the input language that can result in the same color in the output.

Based on the information we have, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,76,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,76,zup
"Considering each of the given examples individually and focusing on the placement and repetition of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can observe that each instance of ""bluf"" directly corresponds to a color output that is a duplicate of the color output of the word that immediately precedes it:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (blue), the output is ""blue blue.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red), the output is ""red red.""
- When ""bluf"" is between two instances of ""lug"" (blue) or ""dax"" (green), the output reflects the duplication of the color of the word directly before ""bluf.""

This leads to the induction that the word ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word right before ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" means to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,76,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can infer that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when it directly follows ""wif,"" and ""green"" when it follows ""dax."" However, when it follows ""zup"" or ""lug,"" it translates to ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" respectively.

Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that its meaning changes depending on the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence.

Rule:
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
- ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""

So we can deduce the following general rule for bluf:

Rule: bluf -> The output for bluf is the color word that corresponds to the color output of the immediately preceding word repeated twice.",1.0,76,bluf
"From the examples given, we can establish a pattern and deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf."" We will analyze each example to see what ""bluf"" corresponds to in the output:

1. Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
In this case, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

2. Input: wif lug zup bluf -> Output: red blue yellow yellow
Here, ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. Input: lug wif bluf -> Output: blue red red
Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: lug bluf dax bluf -> Output: blue blue green green
In this example, both instances of ""bluf"" correspond to the color immediately preceding it: the first ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and the second ""bluf"" to ""green.""

5. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax -> Output: green green red yellow green
Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color immediately preceding it, which is ""green.""

Based on these examples, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is immediately preceding ""bluf"" in the input sequence.

So, our rule induction would be:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: bluf replicates the color word immediately preceding it in the sequence.",1.0,76,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red (if followed by wif), blue (if followed by lug), green (if followed by dax), yellow (if followed by zup or at the end of the sequence)",0.0,76,bluf
"bluf -> red

Rule: The word bluf takes on the color value of the word preceding it in the input. If there is no preceding word, as in the first input example, bluf defaults to 'yellow'.",0.0,76,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" causes the word that comes before it to be repeated three times in the output. Taking this into account, let's break down the examples:

- In the first example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", indicating that the word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" causes this yellow to be repeated three times.

- In the second example, ""dax walm zup lug dax"" gives us ""green green green yellow blue green"". Here, ""walm"" comes after ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"". Consequently, ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times.
  
- The third example, ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"", results in a ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red"" sequence. Once again, ""walm"" is responsible for the triple ""yellow"". The rest of the words correspond to their respective colors.
  
- The fourth example, ""zup wif walm"", translates into ""yellow red red red"". This is particularly telling as ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", but ""walm"" appears at the end, thus indicating that ""walm"" still causes ""red"" to repeat three times although there is no word after ""walm"".

- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""dax walm wif"", which results in ""green green green red"", we see that ""walm"" again causes ""green"", linked to ""dax"", to be repeated three times before moving to ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"".

These examples establish the consistent pattern where ""walm"" causes the color linked to the word preceding it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the previous word's associated color to be repeated three times.",1.0,76,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's correlate the outputs with the presence of ""walm"" in the inputs.

Looking at each example:
1. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
2. Input: dax walm zup lug dax -> Output: green green green yellow blue green
3. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
4. Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
5. Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red

In each case, the appearance of ""walm"" seems to produce a triplet of the color that corresponds with the word immediately preceding it. For example:
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green""

It is also noted that after the triple color repetition induced by ""walm,"" the pattern returns to normal single color mapping for words following ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule is:
walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it causes the output color that corresponds to that word to be repeated three times.",1.0,76,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can analyze the word ""walm"" and its context to deduce its meaning. By examining how the output pattern changes with the presence of ""walm,"" we can infer a rule about its significance.

Here's a breakdown of the examples:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and results in a repetition of ""yellow.""

2. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and we see a repetition of ""green"" before the pattern continues normally starting with ""zup.""

3. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and results in repetition of ""yellow"" before the pattern continues with the regular colors assigned to the following words.

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""walm"" is at the end after ""wif"" (which corresponds to red), and ""red"" is repeated.

5. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which corresponds to green), resulting in a repetition of ""green"" followed by the color for ""wif.""

From these observations, it appears that ""walm"" causes the previous color word to be repeated three times. So, if ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it leads to three ""yellows."" Similarly, when ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green""), it causes three ""greens"" to be outputted.

Rule: walm -> causes the color word that immediately precedes it to be repeated three times.

Therefore: walm -> causes repetition of the preceding color.",0.9,76,walm
"Based on the patterns observed in the input and output examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of the color that immediately follows it, repeating as many times as the color that precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

- ""dax walm zup lug dax"" outputs ""green green green yellow blue green"". ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""walm"" causes ""green"" to repeat three times before the sequence continues.
- ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red"". Again, ""walm"" causes the ""yellow"" which corresponds to ""zup"" to repeat three times.
- ""zup wif walm"" outputs ""yellow red red red"". ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes ""red"" to repeat, this time three times since ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow"") precedes ""wif"".
- ""dax walm wif"" outputs ""green green green red"". ""Walm"" causes ""green"" to repeat three times, since ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green"") precedes ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red"").

Other words such as ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""walm"" correspond to different colors (""red,"" ""blue,"" ""green"" in the cases shown above), but ""zup"" consistently correlates with ""yellow.""

Therefore, we can state the rule for ""zup"":
Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,77,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Each appearance of the word ""zup"" in the input corresponds directly to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,77,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" The rule can be confirmed by the consistent output whenever ""zup"" appears in the input.

"bluf -> blue. Rule: whenever the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, it translates to ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,77,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color that is the same as the word that immediately precedes it.

Explanation of the rule based on examples:

- In ""zup bluf lug"", ""zup"" means yellow, so ""bluf"" means yellow.
- In ""dax bluf wif lug zup"", ""dax"" means green, so ""bluf"" means green.
- In ""lug dax bluf"", ""dax"" means green, so ""bluf"" means green.
- In ""lug wif lug bluf"", the last ""lug"" means blue, so ""bluf"" means blue.
- In ""wif bluf"", ""wif"" means red, so ""bluf"" means red.

Bluf -> The same color as the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,77,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> green

The rule can be deduced from the consistent substitution of ""bluf"" with ""green"" in the given input-output pairs.",0.0,77,bluf
"walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is used, it indicates that the color associated with the preceding word should be repeated three times in the output. For example, if ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which is associated with yellow, then the output will have ""yellow"" repeated three times.",1.0,77,walm
"Walm -> repetition of the color corresponding to the preceding word

Rule:
When the word ""walm"" follows another word associated with a color, it causes the repetition of the color output of the preceding word as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence. For example, if ""walm"" is the second word, the color corresponding to the first word is repeated twice. If ""walm"" is the fifth word, the color corresponding to the fourth word is repeated five times, and so on.",1.0,77,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. We can deduce this because:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which yields ""blue""), and the output contains three ""blue"" in a row.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" again, and we see three ""blue"" in a row in the output.
3. The third example features ""walm"" after ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red"") first and then after ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow""), resulting in a series of ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively.
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which yields ""green""), and the output is triple ""green"".
5. The fifth example again shows ""walm"" after ""lug"" (blue), resulting in the output of three ""blue"".

Thus, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,77,walm
"Based on the examples, the word ""walm"" appears to cause the output to repeat the color that directly preceded it multiple times.

In the first example, ""lug"" outputs blue, and it is followed by walm, which results in ""blue red red"". Here walm seems to repeat the blue once and then output red as well.

In the second example, ""lug"" again precedes walm and the output is ""blue blue blue"", implying that walm repeated the blue color output twice.

In the third example, ""zup"" precedes walm and the output sequence is ""yellow yellow yellow"" which confirms that walm repeats the yellow color that came from ""zup"" twice.

In the fourth example, ""dax"" is followed by walm and the output is ""green green green,"" which further supports the idea that walm repeats the preceding color two times.

In the fifth and last example, ""lug"" again precedes walm and the output is ""blue blue blue"", consistent with the previous examples.

From this analysis we can deduce that walm causes the preceding color to occur two additional times in the output.

"dax -> green

Rule: When ""dax"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.",1.0,78,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green,"" regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the presence of other words. Here are the observations:

1. When ""dax"" is followed by other words (e.g., ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" ""walm,"" ""lug,"" ""wif""), the output still includes ""green"" corresponding specifically to the presence of ""dax.""
2. When ""dax"" is the sole input, the output is ""green.""
3. When ""dax"" is in different positions (e.g., first word, second word), it still corresponds to ""green.""

Given this consistent pattern, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: Every time the word ""dax"" appears in an input, it corresponds to the output ""green,"" regardless of its position or the presence of other words. 

Hence, dax -> green.",1.0,78,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present. Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,78,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax"", let's examine the correlation between the presence of the word ""dax"" and the output colors.

- Whenever ""dax"" is present, the first color in the output is green.
- The color changes only occur with the addition of other words.
- When ""dax"" is alone, the output is a single green.
- When ""dax"" is followed by a word, each following word has a corresponding color that does not seem to depend on the word's position relative to ""dax"".

Based on this, we can infer that ""dax"" correlates with the color green, but the outcome of subsequent colors depends on the other words, not on ""dax"" itself. 

Rule: ""dax"" -> green",1.0,78,dax
"Rule: wif -> red

In each example where ""wif"" appears, the output is always ""red"". Regardless of position or surrounding words, ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red"".",1.0,78,wif

"Based on the examples provided, ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,78,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red."" We can check this hypothesis by looking for consistent patterns in the input and corresponding output:

1. Whenever ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red.""
2. When ""wif"" appears with another word, such as ""walm,"" which is repeated in the output (""red red red""), ""wif"" still translates to ""red.""
3. When ""wif"" is part of a sequence with other words, regardless of position (""dax bluf wif zup"" or ""lug walm wif zup wif""), each instance of ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

Rule: ""wif"" always translates to ""red,"" and the other words translate to different colors based on their own rules.

wif -> red.",1.0,78,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be:

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' corresponds to the color yellow.",1.0,78,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,78,zup
"Based on the examples provided and the consistent association between the word ""zup"" and the color mentioned in the output, the rule seems quite straightforward:

zup -> yellow

Therefore, whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.",1.0,78,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the word ""zup"" is as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in all given contexts.",1.0,78,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can see that each time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

zup -> yellow.",1.0,78,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can analyze the patterns to understand what ""bluf"" might mean in the context of the input and the corresponding output:

First, let's look for the direct occurrences of ""bluf"" and their outputs.

1. ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" -> ""red green red red yellow red""

2. ""dax walm wif bluf"" -> ""green green green red red""

3. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" -> ""red red green green red red red blue red""

4. ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""

5. ""dax bluf wif"" -> ""green green red""

From these examples, we can deduce a possible rule for the meaning of ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""zup"". The output for ""bluf"" in this sequence is ""red"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and has no word after it. The output is again ""red"", suggesting ""bluf"" maps to ""red"" independently of what comes after it.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" occurs twice: first, it follows ""wif"" and precedes ""dax"", again mapping to ""red""; second, it follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif"", still mapping to ""red"". This supports the notion that ""bluf"" is consistently mapped to ""red"".
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""wif"" and ""dax"" in different orders but still maps to ""red"".

A potential complication arises in the third example, where ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif"". However, in this sequence, all elements, including ""bluf"", map to ""red"", suggesting that the presence of these three specific words consecutively might trigger a special rule overriding the standard mapping of ""dax"" to ""green"".

However, considering the consistency across the rest of the examples, it appears safe to conclude that ""bluf"" consistently correlates with ""red"" in the output, regardless of the surrounding context.

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,78,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's observe each instance where ""bluf"" occurs and compare it to the corresponding output color:

1. When ""bluf"" occurs after ""wif,"" the output is red.
2. When ""bluf"" occurs at the end of the statement, the output is red.
3. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is green.
4. When ""bluf"" occurs before another ""bluf,"" the output is red.
5. When ""bluf"" occurs after ""dax,"" the output is green.
6. When ""bluf"" occurs before ""dax,"" the output is red.

Looking at these examples, ""bluf"" seems to correspond consistently to the output ""red."" However, when ""bluf"" is directly preceded by ""dax,"" it corresponds to the output ""green."" Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be dependent on its position relative to ""dax.""

Rule: bluf -> ""red,"" except when directly preceded by ""dax,"" then ""green.""",1.0,78,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output. The presence of ""bluf"" in the input consistently corresponds to ""red"" in the output.",1.0,78,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" Let's analyze each instance where ""bluf"" appears and its corresponding output in the sequences:

1. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
   Output: red green red red yellow red
   - Just before ""bluf"" the color is red, after ""bluf"" the color is yellow.

2. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   - ""Bluf"" appears after ""wif"" and the color is red, the second instance of ""red.""

3. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   - ""Bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" the color is red, and following another ""bluf,"" the color is still red.

4. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red
   - ""Bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" the color is red.

5. Input: dax bluf wif
   Output: green green red
   - ""Bluf"" appears after ""dax,"" and the color is green.

From these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the following pattern:

When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the color is red.
When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the color is green.
   
Combining this with the examples:

bluf -> meaning. The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it: ""red"" if it follows ""wif,"" and ""green"" if it follows ""dax"". Rule: When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" output is ""red."" When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" output is ""green.""",1.0,78,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the input and output patterns closely:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
2. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by a word not in the list (e.g., ""zup""), the output is ""red yellow.""
3. When ""bluf"" stands between ""dax"" and ""wif,"" the output is ""green red.""
4. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""

Now, let's identify a pattern for the other words:

- ""wif"" seems to consistently map to ""red.""
- ""dax"" seems to consistently map to ""green.""
- ""walm"" seems to map to ""green"" when it follows ""dax"" but to ""red"" when it follows ""wif.""
- ""lug"" directly corresponds to ""blue.""

Given that ""bluf"" results in ""red"" just like ""wif,"" we might infer that ""bluf"" has the same output as ""wif"" but only under certain conditions. However, this is inconsistent with the output when ""bluf"" follows ""dax.""

Based on the available data, it seems that ""bluf"" can be either ""red"" or ""green,"" and its meaning changes depending on the context, specifically the word immediately before it. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

- If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" then the output is ""red.""
- If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" then the output is ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> ""red"" if preceded by ""wif"", ""green"" if preceded by ""dax"".",0.9,78,bluf
"Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"". Here is the breakdown of the instances:

- In ""wif walm dax zup"", ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after ""walm"", the output is ""red red red"", showing ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""red"".
- In ""dax walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""walm"", the output is ""green green green"", again indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"".
- In ""lug walm zup"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue"", following the pattern of repetition based on the preceding word.
- In ""wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after ""walm"", the output is ""red red red"", consistently repeating the color before ""walm"".
- In ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"", the word before ""walm"" is ""lug"", which corresponds to blue. After ""walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue"", until another color is mentioned, ""dax"", which changes the color to green.

Walm -> meaning: ""Walm"" indicates that the preceding word's corresponding color should be repeated until a different color word is encountered.",1.0,78,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the given examples and identify the patterns associated with the use of the word ""walm"" and the corresponding output colors:

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Analyzing the Output:
1. Whenever ""walm"" appears after a word, all the preceding words share the same color in the output.
2. The color changes right after ""walm"" and doesn't seem to be influenced by it.
3. The presence of ""walm"" doesn't affect the color of the words that come after it.

Examining the Inputs:
1. ""wif walm"" always leads to ""red red red.""
2. ""dax walm"" always leads to ""green green green.""
3. ""lug walm zup"" leads to ""blue blue blue yellow,"" where ""zup"" seems to determine the color yellow, and ""lug"" determines blue.
4. ""lug walm dax lug"" sequence turns into ""blue blue blue green blue,"" signifying that ""dax"" is linked to green when following ""walm.""

Rule:
Based on the observations, ""walm"" seems to result in the preceding word dictating the color of all words until ""walm"" itself. ""Walm"" triggers repetition in color based on the color assigned to the word immediately before it.

Conclusion:
walm -> Meaning: A function that causes the preceding word to dictate the color output up to but not including the position of ""walm."" Rule: If ""x"" is the word before ""walm,"" then the color of ""x"" is applied to all words before ""walm"" in the sequence.",1.0,78,walm
"Observing the patterns in the given examples, it can be deduced as follows:

1. ""wif walm dax zup"" outputs ""red red red green yellow."" Here ""walm"" is surrounded by ""wif"" and ""dax,"" both of which translate to ""red,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

2. ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green."" ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

3. ""lug walm zup"" outputs ""blue blue blue yellow."" Here, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

4. ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red."" This results in ""red"" colors following the word ""wif.""

5. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" outputs ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue."" The colors appear to link to the words before ""walm"": ""wif"" connects with ""red,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""dax"" with ""green.""

Based on the given data, it can be deduced that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that appears immediately before it.

Rule: walm -> meaning: ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the previous word.",0.9,78,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns:

- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is three reds.
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is three greens.
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is three blues.
- When ""walm"" appears without a specific preceding word, the output is red if ""wif"" is elsewhere in the input, green if ""dax"" is elsewhere in the input, and blue if ""lug"" is elsewhere in the input.

The color that ""walm"" represents seems to be determined by the word that precedes it, or by other words earlier in the input sequence. If ""walm"" is working as a kind of ""chameleon"" word, it takes on the color according to the last color-related word seen in the sequence before ""walm"" itself.

Rule: walm -> adopts the color associated with the preceding color-related word or, if isolated, the earlier present color-related word in the sequence.",0.9,78,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" influences the output color sequence, which directly follows the mention of ""walm."" Here's what we can deduce from each of the given examples:

1. Input: ""wif walm dax zup"" 
   Output: ""red red red green yellow""
2. Input: ""dax walm""
   Output: ""green green green""
3. Input: ""lug walm zup""
   Output: ""blue blue blue yellow""
4. Input: ""wif walm""
   Output: ""red red red""
5. Input: ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug""
   Output: ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue""

From the examples, we observe:

- The color immediately following ""walm"" is always repeated three times (or for however many words follow ""walm"" if fewer than three words are present).
- The color that is repeated is generally associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"":
  - When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output color is ""red.""
  - When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output color is ""blue.""
  - When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output color is ""green.""
  
The only exception to this rule seems to be when ""walm"" is preceded by a word associated with ""yellow"" (""zup"" or ""bluf""). In these cases, ""walm"" does not affect the output, as seen in the 1st and 5th examples, where ""yellow"" is not repeated after ""walm.""

With this information, we can define the rule as follows:

Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears in the input, it causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times in the output (if there are at least three words following ""walm""). If ""walm"" is preceded by a word associated with ""yellow,"" it does not influence the repeated color.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: A command to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times in the output. If the preceding word's associated color is ""yellow,"" this rule does not apply.",0.8,78,walm
"Analyzing each of the input-output pairs, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" translates to a specific color in the output. To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's examine the presence of ""lug"" and its corresponding output color in each given example:

- The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""red"".
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow"".
- The word ""walm"" is paired with ""blue"" in the first input, but since ""lug"" also corresponds to ""blue"" and is present in the same input, we can't confirm the meaning of ""walm"" for sure. It does not appear in any other example.
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green"".

The nonce word ""wif"" appears in multiple examples and consistently, its presence in an input leads to a ""red"" in the corresponding output, regardless of its position in the sequence.

Since ""blue"" is not a unique color for ""zup"" and ""wif"" can correlate to the color ""red"" as seen in the last example, it might be a mistake or there's another rule affecting the result.

- In examples 2 and 3, ""zup"" is the only input and ""yellow"" is the sole output.

- In example 4, ""zup"" appears twice and both times the output is ""yellow.""

- In the last example, ""zup"" comes at the end of a sequence of words, and the corresponding output is ""yellow.""

Considering these instances and especially the clear correlation in the second and third examples, we can rule out that the appearance of the color ""blue"" in the first example is a part of a more complex rule or a context-specific anomaly. Focusing on the simplest and most consistent meaning, we can determine the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.",0.8,79,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to correlate with the color immediately preceding it in the output. When the input contains ""bluf,"" the corresponding output is a repetition of the color that immediately precedes ""bluf."" Here is the breakdown:

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green
(""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and after ""bluf"" we see ""yellow"" repeated.)

Input: dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow
(""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and after ""bluf"" we see ""green"" repeated.)

Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
Output: yellow green yellow green red red
(""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and after ""bluf"" we see ""red"" repeated.)

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
(""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and after ""bluf"" we see ""green"" repeated.)

Input: lug bluf wif
Output: blue blue red
(""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and after ""bluf"" we see ""blue"" repeated.)

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word (color) before it in the output.",1.0,79,bluf
"From the examples provided, each occurrence of ""bluf"" corresponds to a repeated color word in the outputs. We observe that ""bluf"" follows the color of the word immediately preceding it:

1. wif zup bluf -> red yellow yellow
2. dax bluf -> green green
3. lug bluf -> blue blue

Rule:
bluf -> the same color as the word that comes right before it.",1.0,79,bluf
"Based on the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" represents the color that immediately precedes it. When ""bluf"" is present, it translates to the same color as the word before it. Here is the rule determined from the examples:

- In ""wif zup bluf wif dax"", ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which translates to yellow, so ""bluf"" is translated to yellow.
- In ""dax bluf wif zup"", ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", which translates to green, so ""bluf"" is translated to green.
- In ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which translates to red, so there are two reds in the output.
- In ""dax bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which translates to green, so ""bluf"" is translated to green.
- In ""lug bluf wif"", ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", which translates to blue, so ""bluf"" is translated to blue.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word that comes immediately before it.",1.0,79,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color that follows the pattern present in the sequences. The rules that can be deduced are as follows:

1. wif corresponds to red.
2. dax corresponds to green.
3. zup corresponds to yellow.
4. lug corresponds to blue.

Using this pattern, we can analyze the term ""bluf"" in the context of each input sequence:

- In ""wif zup bluf wif dax,"" ""bluf"" is being followed by ""wif,"" which means red. Therefore, ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow, matching the color that comes before it (zup -> yellow).
- In ""dax bluf wif zup,"" ""bluf"" is being followed by ""wif,"" meaning it should match the color of ""dax,"" which is green.
- In ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf,"" the pattern suggests that ""bluf"" should match with the color of the word that comes before ""wif,"" which is ""dax,"" so it should be green. However, ""bluf"" is outputted as red red, which is the same color for ""wif"" but repeated twice. This may indicate that ""bluf"" doubles the color output of the word that immediately follows it.
- In ""dax bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and since there is no word following ""bluf"" for comparison, it replicates the color of ""dax,"" which is green.
- In ""lug bluf wif,"" ""bluf"" is following ""lug,"" which is blue, and is followed by ""wif,"" which is red. Nonetheless, ""bluf"" results in blue, replicating the color of the word before it.

From these observations, we can infer a rule: ""bluf"" seems to replicate the color of the word that comes immediately before it. However, if ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" it results in a repetition of the color that ""wif"" would represent.

Rule: bluf -> Replicates the color of the word that immediately precedes it unless it is followed by ""wif,"" in which case it replicates the color corresponding to ""wif,"" red, twice.",0.8,79,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, each time the word ""bluf"" is present in the input, it translates to ""green"" in the output. All other words seem to have a fixed corresponding color as well: ""wif"" is consistently associated with ""red"", ""zup"" with ""yellow"", ""dax"" with ""green"", and ""lug"" with ""blue"".

Thus, we can determine the rule:

Rule: bluf -> green.",0.0,79,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs associated with each input and look for patterns.

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" also to ""green.""

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
- In this example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm,"" based on the previous example, could be ""green,"" but the output shows ""blue."" This implies ""walm"" might not correspond to a single color but might be influenced by its position or the surrounding context.

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow
- ""lug"" is consistently associated with ""blue,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" ""walm"" is followed by ""blue"" in the output, again matching the color of the word before it, which is ""lug.""

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- ""zup"" matches ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Following the pattern observed, ""walm"" is associated with ""red,"" which is the color of the word before it, ""wif.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- In this example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Without any other word following ""walm,"" the pattern indicates that ""walm"" should adopt the color of the preceding word, resulting in ""green"" here.

Based on the observations:
walm -> Takes on the color of the preceding word (when there is a preceding word). If there is no preceding word, it appears to have a default color of green.

Rule:
If ""walm"" follows a word, the output color for ""walm"" will match the output color of the word that comes directly before it.
If ""walm"" is the first word or stands alone, the output color for ""walm"" will be green.",1.0,79,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a pattern of repeating the color associated with the previous word. In each output, the color immediately following ""walm"" is the same color that translates from the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Let's analyze the examples:

- In the first example, ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red"". Here, ""walm"" is followed by green, which is the same color associated with ""dax"" that precedes it.
- In the second example, ""wif lug walm"" translates to ""red blue blue blue"". The color following ""walm"" is blue, which corresponds to ""lug"" that comes just before ""walm.""
- In the third example, ""lug walm zup"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow."" The word ""walm"" is followed again by the color blue, associated with ""lug.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" Here, ""walm"" follows the color red, which corresponds to ""wif.""
- In the last example, ""dax walm,"" without the third word, still translates to ""green green green,"" reinforcing the pattern that ""walm"" mirrors the color associated with the word just before it.

Rule: walm -> The output color for ""walm"" will be the same as the color output for the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,79,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we will look for patterns in the provided examples.

In the first example, ""dax walm wif"" corresponds to ""green green green red."" ""Dax"" is the only common word in all instances where ""green"" appears, so it is likely that ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green."" The last word ""wif"" must then correspond to ""red,"" as it is the only word in this instance that leads to ""red"" and it consistently leads to ""red"" in other examples. That leaves ""walm"" corresponding to the second and third instances of ""green.""

In the second example, ""wif lug walm"" produces ""red blue blue blue."" We already deduced that ""wif"" is ""red,"" and it appears the word ""lug"" is consistently leading to ""blue,"" as it does so in every instance it is present. With ""walm"" at the end, this sequence ends with ""blue,"" suggesting ""walm"" might relate to ""blue"" in this context.

The third example, ""lug walm zup,"" leads to ""blue blue blue yellow."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" again, and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" as it does in the fourth example when it is the first word. ""Walm"" appears between two ""blue"" outputs, reinforcing the notion that it might contribute to a ""blue"" output.

However, in the fourth example ""zup wif walm,"" we get ""yellow red red red."" We see ""walm"" at the end, leading to ""red,"" but we have already tied ""wif"" to ""red.""

Looking at the last example, ""dax walm,"" which leads to ""green green green,"" it is now clear that ""walm"" is not tied to a single color but instead repeats the color associated with the previous word. That is:

- When preceded by ""dax,"" ""walm"" leads to ""green"" (replicating ""dax"").
- When preceded by ""lug,"" ""walm"" leads to ""blue"" (replicating ""lug"").
- When preceded by ""wif,"" ""walm"" leads to ""red"" (replicating ""wif"").

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

walm -> meaning: ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color indicated by the word immediately before it. If there is no preceding word (as in the last example), ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the standalone word.",1.0,79,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can look for patterns in the examples given.

Examining each input and corresponding output:

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- The output corresponds to three greens followed by a red. Since ""dax"" and ""wif"" are both before and after ""walm"" in other examples, they cannot be responsible for all three greens. Therefore, ""walm"" likely contributes to at least the second green.

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
- ""Walm"" is at the end and ""wif"" is at the beginning; ""lug"" is in the middle, resulting in a pattern that ends with three blues. This suggests ""walm"" contributes to the last blue.

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow
- ""Walm"" is in the middle, suggesting that it may contribute to at least one of the blues, as ""zup"" is responsible for the yellow.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- ""Walm"" is at the end again, suggesting it contributes to the last red.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- There's no third item, and the pattern is three greens. This reinforces that ""walm"" is responsible for green when in a pair.

From these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" is contributing to the second color in the output, which is always the same as the first color in the output. This suggests that ""walm"" is a repeater for the first color.

Rule: walm -> when present in an input, it duplicates the color associated with the first item in the sequence. If the first item's color is green, ""walm"" will also be green; if the first item's color is blue, ""walm"" will repeat blue; and so on.",0.9,79,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repeated color. The color that is repeated is determined by the word that comes before ""walm."" Here’s the breakdown:

- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" hence ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""walm"" repeats it three times.
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" hence ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" repeats it three times.
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" hence ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" repeats it three times.
- When ""walm"" is followed by another word, ""wif,"" ""lug,"" or ""zup,"" it results in the corresponding color being output once more after the three repetitions.
- The presence of ""walm"" at the end of the input seems to cause it to repeat the color of the last word before it, without ""walm"" leading to duplication of the last color (e.g., ""dax walm"" vs. ""dax walm wif"").

With this considered, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times, and if there is another word following ""walm,"" output the color associated with that word once more.

However, the last example ""dax walm"" only repeats the color twice, which might be an inconsistency or indicates that ""walm"" always needs a word after it to complete the pattern. Since the other four examples contain three words before ""walm"" and consistently produce the color repetition three times followed by one additional color, this inconsistency in the ""dax walm"" example could be a mistake. 

Assuming the last example is incorrect or an anomaly, the given rule still stands. If the last example is correct, the rule would need to account for scenarios where ""walm"" is at the end with no following word, which currently seems inconsistent with the pattern seen when ""walm"" is followed by another word.",0.8,79,walm

"To deduce the meaning or rule of ""dax,"" let's analyze the output patterns associated with each example.

1. When ""dax"" appears at the beginning of the input (example 1, 2, and 3), the output starts with ""green.""
2. When ""dax"" appears after other words (example 4 and 5), it still corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
3. ""dax"" never correlates with any other color in the output, therefore it consistently represents ""green.""
4. Other words such as ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""lug,"" and ""bluf"" seem to have different output colors which change depending on their position or repetition in the input sequence.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""dax"" is independent of context or position in the string of words. ""Dax"" always maps to the color ""green"" in the output regardless of where it appears in the input.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,80,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""dax"" is present, the output is always ""green."" It doesn't change with position or surrounding words. Thus ""dax"" corresponds directly to the color ""green.""",1.0,80,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green,"" no matter its position in the input string or the context of the other words present. It is clear that ""dax"" is directly associated with the output ""green,"" regardless of other factors.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,80,dax
"To figure out the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the consistency of its representation in the output and its position in the input:

1. When ""dax"" is used in the input, the output always begins with ""green.""
2. ""Dax"" does not seem to require any specific context to be translated to ""green,"" as it appears in various positions in the example inputs, both at the beginning and in the middle of sequences.
3. No other word in the input seems to consistently correlate with ""green"" in the output.
4. Regardless of the surrounding words (""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" ""walm""), ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""dax"" in the input consistently corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context provided by other words.

Therefore:

dax -> green",1.0,80,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax"" based on the given examples, we need to analyze the relation between the input and output in various scenarios.

From the first example:
Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
We can see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

From the second example:
Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
Here, ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green.""

From the third example:
Input: dax
Output: green
Once again, ""dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green.""

From the fourth example:
Input: lug dax lug

We can notice that ""dax"" remains consistent with ""green,"" while ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

From the last example:
Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green
""Dax"" once more corresponds to ""green."" This time ""wif"" and ""walm"" lead to ""red"" and ""green"" respectively.

"Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" can be deduced using a comparison approach. By reviewing each example and its corresponding output, we can isolate the occurrences of ""zup"" and identify its meaning in context. Here is the analysis:

- In every input where ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
- No matter what other words (""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""bluf,"" or ""wif"") are used in the input, only ""zup"" consistently maps to the output ""yellow.""
- The other words in the inputs have different outputs when ""zup"" is not present, indicating that they likely correspond to other colors.
- The position of ""zup"" in the input does not change the output; it always translates to ""yellow"" regardless of whether it is at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is consistent across all examples:

zup -> meaning. Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,80,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

"Based on the given examples, one can induce the following pattern for the word ""zup"":

Whenever ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" is included in the output at the corresponding position. 

This consistent behavior, irrespective of the position of ""zup"" in the input string, or the other words around it, allows us to conclude that ""zup"" directly translates to ""yellow"". 

Other words like ""dax"" and ""wif"" must correspond to other colors based on their respective positions relative to ""zup"" and each other.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the immediately preceding word.",1.0,80,bluf
"Based on the given examples, you can infer the following relationships:

1. ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" but also seems to trigger a ""red"" after any non-""lug"" word that follows it.
2. ""wif"" results in ""red"" if preceded by ""lug"", otherwise it does not appear.
3. ""bluf"" follows the color of the word right before it.
4. ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
5. ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".

The non-""bluf"" words seem to have fixed translations, while ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word. For instance, in the first example ""lug wif bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" (because it follows ""lug""), and ""bluf"" repeats the color ""red"" from ""wif"". Similarly, in ""dax bluf"", ""dax"" becomes ""green"", and ""bluf"" repeats that color, becoming ""green"" again.

Based on this pattern, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it takes on the color of the immediately preceding word. Therefore:

bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,80,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates to a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the reasoning according to the provided inputs and outputs:

- ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue,"" providing further evidence that ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color word before it (blue-blue, then later red-red-red).

- ""zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow red,"" again supporting the rule, as ""yellow"" is repeated due to ""bluf"".

- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" showing that ""bluf"" repeats the green color given by ""dax"".

- ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue green green,"" wherein ""bluf"" causes the repetition of green after ""dax"".

   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red
   - ""walm lug"" has ""lug"" after ""walm,"" so ""lug"" corresponding to red is repeated until the next color word, which is ""zup"" corresponding to blue

   - ""wif"" corresponds to red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green
   - ""walm lug"" again has ""lug"" after ""walm,"" which repeats green until the next color word, ""lug"" corresponding to blue
   
3. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
   - ""dax walm"" has no corresponding color word after ""walm,"" thus ""dax"" corresponding to green is repeated until the sequence ends
   
4. Input: lug walm zup lug walm

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the positioning and corresponding color outputs in each example.

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

In this sequence, ""walm"" appears after ""wif"" and before ""lug,"" and then after ""zup."" The corresponding colors are ""red"" for the first ""walm"" and ""yellow"" for the second ""walm.""

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue

Here ""walm"" is after ""dax"" and before ""lug,"" and the corresponding color is ""green.""

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green

""Walm"" follows ""dax"" again and precedes no word, and its color is ""green.""

Input: lug walm zup lug walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

There are two ""walm"" instances, each follows ""lug""; the first ""walm"" leads to a color ""blue"" and the second one also to ""blue.""

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

""Walm"" comes after ""zup"" and before ""lug,"" giving it the color ""yellow.""

From the examples, it seems that the color output for ""walm"" depends on the word that comes directly before it. Here are the observed rules:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the color is ""red.""
2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the color is ""green.""
3. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the color is ""yellow.""
4. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the color is ""blue.""

So, we might induce that ""walm"" takes on the color indicated by the word that precedes it.

Rule: walm -> The color output for ""walm"" depends on the preceding word:
- After ""wif,"" walm means red.
- After ""dax,"" walm means green.
- After ""zup,"" walm means yellow.
- After ""lug,"" walm means blue.",1.0,80,walm

   - Again, ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" results in additional green outputs.

4. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in additional blue outputs. ""zup"" does not seem to be affected by ""walm"" here.

5. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   - ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in additional yellow outputs.

Considering the above examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the last color invoked before ""walm"". It repeats the output color corresponding to the word that appears immediately before it. This is evident because whenever ""walm"" appears, following outputs repeat the color of the word before ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> repeats the output color of the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,80,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the recurring patterns in regard to the appearance of ""walm"" and the corresponding output colors:

1. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue

3. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green

4. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

5. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

In these examples, the appearance of ""walm"" does not correspond to one specific color, indicating that ""walm"" does not translate directly to a singular color. However, observing the changes that occur in the sequence when ""walm"" is introduced, we can deduce a pattern based on the positional context of ""walm.""

In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax wif"" which is assigned ""green red,"" but here ""walm"" has resulted in three ""red"" outputs (""red red red"") before the sequence changes color at ""lug."" Subsequently, another ""walm"" appears and is followed by three ""yellow"" outputs.

Using similar analysis for each example, we can infer the following pattern:

- ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to repeat three times.

With this context-sensitive rule in mind, we can define the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in a sequence, it extends the color associated with the preceding word, causing the output to reflect that color for three additional instances beyond the usual single instance.",0.9,80,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should analyze its occurrences and the corresponding outputs:

- ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow""
- ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> ""yellow red green green green blue""
- ""lug zup dax walm"" -> ""blue yellow green green green""
- ""lug walm zup lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue""
- ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green""

Observations for ""walm"":
1. When ""walm"" appears after ""dax"", it leads to a sequence of reds until a different color is introduced (""blue"" in the first example).
2. When ""walm"" appears after ""lug"", it leads to a blue (second example, fourth example).
3. When ""walm"" appears before ""lug"", it seems to modify the color output to multiple instances of the color that would follow ""lug"" (blue in the fourth example).
4. ""walm"" appears to change the sequence in which it appears in the remaining examples, leading to the repetition of the next color to appear after it.

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" has a repeating or emphasizing effect on the color that follows it. Let's formulate a general rule:

Rule: ""walm"" increases the repetition of the color word that comes after it. If the next color word is 'blue', we see a repetition of 'blue'. If ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" we see a repetition of 'red' as ""dax"" is linked to 'green' and the sequence is red until another color appears. 

Thus:
walm -> means to repeat the subsequent color/output in sequence.",0.8,80,walm
"Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the given examples, every time the word 'lug' appears in the input, the word 'blue' appears in the corresponding output position, regardless of the words before or after it. Therefore, we deduce that the rule is that the nonce word 'lug' translates to the color 'blue'.",1.0,81,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" in every example provided. There is no variation in output associated with the appearance of ""lug,"" which means it directly signifies the color blue irrespective of its position or the context within the sequence of words.",1.0,81,lug
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""lug"" seems to consistently correspond to the color ""blue."" In every instance where the word ""lug"" appears, the output color is blue, regardless of its position or the other words around it. Therefore, the rule I have deduced is:

Rule: lug -> blue. Meaning, when you see ""lug,"" you should think of the color blue.",1.0,81,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.",1.0,81,lug
"Given the examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""lug"" by comparing the input with its corresponding output. The process will involve looking for patterns and consistencies:

- In the first example, ""lug"" is followed by three instances of ""wif walm zup,"" and the output after ""lug"" is ""blue"" followed by three sets of ""red red red yellow.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" appears twice, and in the output, it corresponds with the color ""blue"" both times.
- In the third example, ""lug"" is followed by ""dax,"" resulting in ""blue"" followed by ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" is at the beginning and is followed by ""blue"" in the output, and after that sequence, ""wif zup wif walm"" corresponds with ""red yellow red red red.""
- In the last example, ""lug"" is at the end, and its corresponding output color is ""blue.""

From the above observations, we can conclude that irrespective of its position or the words that follow, ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,81,lug
"Rule: dax -> green

Each instance of ""dax"" in the examples corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.",1.0,81,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the nonce word dax appears in an input, the corresponding output is the color green.",1.0,81,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

""Dax"" consistently translates to the color green in each of the provided outputs, regardless of its position or the surrounding words.",1.0,81,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we can analyze the pattern of colors in relation to the given words. Let's examine each input and output pair:

1. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red

2. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue

3. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green

4. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue red green green red

5. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green

Looking at the examples, we can see that each instance of where ""dax"" occurs, the color ""green"" follows. It is also noted that:

- In example 1, the presence of ""dax"" did not affect the color association of ""zup"" which remains ""yellow"".
- In example 2, ""lug"" remains ""blue"", and ""wif"" remains ""red"" regardless of the position of ""dax"".
- In examples 3 and 4, ""wif"" and ""bluf"" still correspond to ""red"" and ""green"", respectively.
- In example 5, ""walm"" still corresponds to ""blue"", in the presence of ""dax"".

By these observations, each word appears to be associated with a certain color and it does not seem to impact or change based on the presence of ""dax"". ""Dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"".

Thus, we can deduce the rule:
Rule: dax -> green",1.0,81,dax
"To infer the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the patterns in the provided examples.

In the first example:
zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green green green yellow red

Here, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"", ""walm"" to ""green"", and ""wif"" to ""red"". The presence of ""dax"" seems to produce ""green"".

In the second example:
lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> blue red green green red blue

In this case, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""bluf"" to ""red"" as well. Again, following ""dax"" we get ""green"".

In the third example:
wif bluf dax -> red red green

Here, both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" translate to ""red"". The word following ""dax"" is missing, but ""dax"" itself corresponds to ""green"" again.

In the fourth example:
zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green green red

The pattern stays consistent with previous examples for the known words. ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"" which corresponds to ""red"", but ""dax"" itself translates to ""green"".

In the fifth example:
lug walm dax -> blue blue green

""lug"" and ""walm"" both translate to ""blue"". ""dax"" once more translates to ""green"".

With each occurrence of ""dax"" resulting in the color ""green"", we can conclude that the word ""dax"" directly corresponds to the color ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,81,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". 

Each example shows that when ""wif"" is presented, ""red"" is part of the output. The order of colors in the output corresponds to the order of the words in the input, implying a direct mapping from the nonce word to a specific color.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,81,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,81,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

The repeated pattern in the examples provided suggests that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the word ""red"", regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,81,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". However, it's important to note that the relative position of other words and their corresponding colors change. ""Zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" with ""blue,"" and ""dax"" with ""green."" 

The sequence of colors in the output directly corresponds to the sequence of words in the input. Each nonce word is converted to its associated color, maintaining the order in which the words appear.

Rule: wif -> ""red""",1.0,81,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" When ""wif"" is included in various positions within a sequence, it consistently results in the color ""red"" in the corresponding position in the output sequence. Meanwhile, other nonce words like ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" and ""lug"" correspond to different colors (""yellow,"" ""blue,"" and ""blue"" respectively), and maintain their color output regardless of their position relative to ""wif.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,81,wif
"zup -> yellow

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".",1.0,81,zup
"Rule: bluf -> ""green"" following the color word that comes right before it. If there's no color word right before it, then bluf translates to ""green"" once.",1.0,81,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" doubles the output color of the word that precedes it. The pattern shows that whatever color the preceding word represents, the term ""bluf"" generates two instances of that color. 

For example:
- ""dax bluf"" becomes ""green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug dax bluf"" becoming ""blue green green"" indicates that ""dax,"" which comes immediately before ""bluf,"" denotes ""green.""
- ""lug zup bluf dax"" results in ""blue yellow yellow green,"" which shows that the effect of ""bluf"" is only on the word right before it (in this case ""zup"" which is matched with ""yellow"") and does not influence ""dax"" that follows after it.

With these observations, we can induce the following rule:

bluf -> Duplicates the color word (output) of the word before it.",1.0,81,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" appears to duplicate the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the reasoning:

- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"", so ""bluf"" must produce another ""green"" when following ""dax"".
- ""lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue green green"", so after ""dax"", which translates to ""green"", ""bluf"" produces another ""green"".
- ""lug zup bluf dax"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow green"", so after ""zup"", which translates to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" produces another ""yellow"".
- ""dax bluf zup"" translates to ""green green yellow"", so again after ""dax"" (""green""), ""bluf"" produces another ""green"".

From these examples, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it replicates the color word immediately before it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the preceding word.",1.0,81,bluf
"bluf -> repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it. Rule: If a word is followed by ""bluf"", it outputs the color associated with that word twice.",1.0,81,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> green

The examples provided consistently associate the nonce word ""bluf"" with the word ""green"" in their output counterparts. Regardless of the position of ""bluf"" in the input or the other words around it, the output includes ""green"" following the word that corresponds to ""bluf.""",1.0,81,bluf
"Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates repetition of the output color associated with the preceding word. 

For example:
- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" whose output color is red, so ""walm"" causes repeating ""red.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which outputs yellow, hence it results in repeating ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and has the output color blue, leading to a repetition of ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, both occurrences of ""walm"" are preceded by ""lug,"" hence a repetition of the output color blue.
- In the last example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" again and repeats the color blue. 

walm -> meaning: The word ""walm"" causes the output color of the preceding word to repeat.",1.0,81,walm
"Rule: walm -> blue blue yellow

In each output example, the term ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue yellow"". Regardless of its position in the input, ""walm"" results in those three colors in the output sequence.",1.0,81,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's look closely at each example and the accompanying colors:

1. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow

In this example, ""wif"" correlates to the color red. After ""walm,"" the word ""zup"" translates to yellow.

2. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

In this example, ""zup"" correlates with yellow, ""wif"" again correlates with red, and ""lug"" correlates with blue. After ""walm,"" ""zup"" continues to translate to yellow.

3. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue

Here, ""dax"" correlates with green and ""lug"" with blue. Following ""walm,"" ""lug"" is still associated with blue.

4. Input: lug walm zup walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow

""Lug"" correlates with blue, ""zup"" with yellow. The color sequence following each ""walm"" is blue yellow.

5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

In this sequence, ""zup"" correlates with yellow, ""dax"" with green, and ""lug"" with blue. Following ""walm,"" ""zup"" is associated with yellow.

From the input and output above, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the previous word.",1.0,81,walm
"Analyzing the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, it appears that the word ""walm"" is associated with a doubling of the last mentioned color before it. To illustrate:

- wif (red) walm -> red red
- zup (yellow) lug (blue) zup (yellow) walm -> yellow yellow yellow
- dax (green) lug (blue) dax (green) lug (blue) walm -> blue blue blue
- lug (blue) walm -> blue blue
- zup (yellow) dax (green) lug (blue) walm zup -> blue blue yellow

So, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the most recent word before ""walm,"" with the color being repeated twice.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word twice.",0.8,81,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns associated with its usage and the corresponding output in each example:

1. Input: wif walm zup

2. Input: zup wif lug zup walm

3. Input: dax lug dax lug walm

4. Input: lug walm zup walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

Analyzing the examples given, we can see that the output color sequence includes the ""walm"" associated color occurring multiple times after every occurrence of the word ""walm.""

In example 1, ""walm"" is followed by the color ""red"" only once since it is at the end of the input sequence.
In example 2, ""walm"" is followed by the color ""yellow"" three times as it is the last word in the input sequence.
In example 3, ""walm"" is followed by the color ""blue"" twice since it is again the last word in the input sequence.
In example 4, ""walm"" is followed by the color ""blue"" once and then ""yellow"" twice after the second occurrence of ""walm.""
In example 5, ""walm"" is followed by the color ""blue"" twice and then ""yellow"" once after its occurrence.

From the analysis, we can see that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word preceding it a certain number of times, which seems to be at least twice if it is the last word in the sequence or at least once otherwise.

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the color of the previously mentioned item to repeat at least once following its own occurrence. If ""walm"" is the final word in the sequence, the color of the previous word repeats at least twice.

Based on the examples provided, every instance of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red.""",1.0,82,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we should look for patterns in its usage across different examples and their corresponding outputs. Let's observe where ""wif"" appears and the output color for each instance:

1. ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" -> ""red green red red yellow red""
   - wif occurs three times and twice red follows it directly. The third time, red follows it indirectly after yellow.

2. ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> ""red red red blue blue""

3. ""wif dax zup walm"" -> ""red green yellow yellow yellow""

So, we can make the following rule:

Walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.",1.0,82,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output includes the word ""blue."" There doesn't seem to be any additional context affecting the meaning of ""lug,"" such as its position in the sentence or the words around it.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,83,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" in every example corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,83,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently replaced with the color ""blue"" in each example given.",1.0,83,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: In each example, the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the output.",1.0,83,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.",1.0,83,lug
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we can look for patterns in how it is used in relation to the colors given in the output. By examining the position of ""dax"" and the corresponding colors, we can attempt to define the rule:

1. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
2. dax lug wif -> green blue red
3. wif dax lug -> red green blue
4. dax zup lug wif zup -> green yellow blue red yellow
5. dax walm -> green green green

From the examples provided:

- In examples 1, 2, and 4, ""dax"" is at the beginning of the input and corresponds to a ""green"" output.
- In example 3, ""dax"" follows ""wif"" and still corresponds to a ""green"" output.
- In example 5, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" (a new word not seen in earlier examples), and it still corresponds to a ""green"" output.

There is no variation in output color when ""dax"" is present; it consistently equates to ""green"" regardless of its position or the words that follow it. Therefore, it can be concluded that ""dax"" on its own does not depend on context to determine its output.

Rule: dax -> ""green"". The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in the output, regardless of its position or context within the given inputs.",1.0,83,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to consider the inputs and the associated outputs. Observing the given examples:

1. ""dax bluf wif zup"" -> ""green green red yellow""
2. ""dax lug wif"" -> ""green blue red""
3. ""wif dax lug"" -> ""red green blue""
4. ""dax zup lug wif zup"" -> ""green yellow blue red yellow""
5. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""

We can notice that every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the same position in the output. For example, in the first and second positions of the input and output of the first example, and in the first and third positions of the input and output of the third example.

Based on this observation, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,83,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" is associated with the word ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Here's the breakdown:

- Input: dax bluf wif zup | Output: green green red yellow
- Input: dax lug wif | Output: green blue red
- Input: wif dax lug | Output: red green blue
- Input: dax zup lug wif zup | Output: green yellow blue red yellow
- Input: dax walm | Output: green green green

Notice that in every example where ""dax"" appears, the output includes ""green."" Also, the relative position of ""dax"" in the input does not seem to affect its associated output color; it remains ""green.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,83,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the given examples and correlate the outputs, which are color names, with the inputs containing ""dax."" Let's examine each instance to identify a consistent rule.

- In examples where ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green."" This doesn't give us much information about ""dax"" alone, as ""green"" could be associated with either ""dax"" or ""bluf.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output has ""green blue."" Once again, we see ""green"" associated with the position of ""dax.""
- Looking at ""dax"" followed by ""zup,"" the output is ""green yellow.""
- Finally, when ""dax"" is used alone, as in ""dax walm,"" the output is ""green green green,"" which suggests each occurrence translates to ""green.""

Based on all examples, every instance when ""dax"" is used, regardless of the word that follows, the first color in the sequence is always ""green."" This suggests that the word ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color ""green."" Therefore, the rule could be:

Rule: ""dax"" translates to ""green.""",1.0,83,dax
"By analyzing the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, we can infer that the nonce word ""dax"" correlates with the color green, as every input that includes ""dax"" results in the color green being in the corresponding output.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,83,dax
"Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" 

Additional context provided by other words seems to modify the output, with ""dax"" adding ""green,"" and ""lug"" adding ""blue."" ""bluf"" combines with ""lug"" to produce ""red blue,"" but since we see ""wif lug"" also results in ""red blue,"" we can deduce ""bluf"" may be superfluous or not alter the meaning of ""lug.""

So, based on the inputs and outputs given:

- ""wif"" alone always results in ""red.""
- When combined with ""dax,"" an additional ""green"" appears in the output.
- When combined with ""lug,"" an additional ""blue"" appears in the output.
- ""bluf"" does not seem to change the output, as ""wif bluf lug"" and ""wif lug"" result in the same ""red blue"" output.

Therefore, we can deduce:

wif -> ""red""",1.0,83,wif
"wif -> red. 

The word ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red"" in every example. 

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" is present, the word ""red"" appears in the output. The additional words after ""wif"" correspond to additional colors (""dax"" to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue""). ""wif"" appears to function as a color indicator, with a default color of red that can be followed by additional color indicators corresponding to additional words.",1.0,83,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we should look at the parts of the input that change and how they correspond with the parts of the output that change. Here's what we can observe from the given data:

- When the input is ""wif dax,"" the output is ""red green."" 
- When the input is ""wif lug,"" the output is ""red blue.""
- When the input is simply ""wif,"" with nothing following it, the output is ""red.""
- When the input is ""wif bluf lug,"" the output is ""red red blue.""
- Again, when the input is simply ""wif,"" we get the same output: ""red.""

Based on these observations, we can infer the following:

- ""wif"" on its own seems to consistently produce the output ""red.""
- When additional words follow ""wif,"" they contribute additional colors to the output.
- The word ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue.""
- The word ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green.""
- The word ""bluf"" is associated with the color ""red.""

Given these consistent associations, we can make the following deduction about the meaning of ""wif"":

Rule: ""wif"" correlates to the color ""red."" When used on its own, it produces the output ""red."" When ""wif"" is followed by other words, it retains its association with ""red,"" and each following word adds additional colors to the output according to their own association.",1.0,83,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce a pattern where the word ""wif"" appears to correspond to the color ""red."" When ""wif"" is followed by other nonce words like ""dax"" or ""lug,"" additional colors appear in the output. For example:

- ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green.""
- ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue.""

When ""wif"" appears alone, only ""red"" is produced in the output. When ""wif"" precedes more than one word, a ""red"" is presented initially, perhaps indicating that ""wif"" always contributes a ""red"" to the sequence, followed by the color corresponding to the subsequent words.

The rules for ""wif"" and the subsequent words seem to be:
- ""wif"" alone produces ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is combined with other nonce words, ""red"" is first in the output sequence, followed by the colors corresponding to each of the other words, in the order they appear.

Based on this observation, the rule for ""wif"" can be written as:
wif -> red (when alone) or red followed by a series of colors correlating to any subsequent nonce words in the order they appear.",0.9,83,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. Every instance of ""wif"" results in the word ""red"" appearing at least once in the output.
2. When ""wif"" is followed by another word, a second color follows ""red"" in the output.
3. The word that follows ""wif"" determines the second color in the output:
    - ""dax"" results in ""green""
    - ""lug"" results in ""blue""
4. The presence of the word ""bluf"" before ""lug"" results in an additional ""red"" before the sequence ""red blue"".

The rule seems to be that ""wif"" indicates the color ""red"", and any additional word included after ""wif"" corresponds to an additional color represented in the output. The word ""bluf"" may be a modifier that adds another instance of ""red"".

Given the above observations, the meaning of ""wif"" appears to be the color ""red"". Additional words (nouns) that follow ""wif"" add more colors to the sequence according to some mapping rule, while ""bluf"" specifically seems to duplicate the ""red"" output.

Rule: wif -> ""red"" (at least one occurrence). Additional words following ""wif"" result in specific additional colors. ""Bluf"" before another word adds another ""red"" before the color corresponding to that word.",0.9,83,wif
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,83,zup

"bluf -> meaning. Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color meaning of the word immediately preceding it. If ""lug"" means blue, then ""lug bluf"" means blue blue. If ""dax"" means green, then ""dax bluf"" means green green, and so on.",1.0,83,bluf
"bluf -> color matching the previous word. Rule: When the word ""bluf"" is used, it translates to the word that names the color associated with the previous word in the sequence. For example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, and ""bluf"" takes on that color's name.",1.0,83,bluf
"Reviewing each of the provided examples, we can see a pattern that emerges with the use of the nonce word ""walm"". It seems that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.

- In the first example, ""zup walm dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green"", where ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow. After ""walm"", yellow is repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""dax lug wif walm"" yields ""green blue red red red"". Here, ""wif"" is before ""walm,"" and the associated color red is repeated three times after ""walm"".
- In the third example, ""wif walm"" becomes ""red red red"", with ""wif"" before ""walm"" leading to red being repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif zup wif walm"" offers ""blue red yellow red red red"". The word ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" resulting in three reds following it.
- In the fifth example, ""wif walm zup"" turns into ""red red red yellow"", with ""wif"" before ""walm"" causing red to be repeated three times before moving on to the next color.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the output to include three occurrences of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. Therefore:

walm -> meaning: The rule is that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.",1.0,83,walm
"walm -> repeating the color of the previous word. Rule: When the nonce word 'walm' appears, it repeats the color of the word immediately before it as many times as that color has appeared in the sequence so far.",1.0,83,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" translates to repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. 

Explanation: 
- In the first example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, hence three yellows follow. 
- In the second example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and it corresponds to red, so ""walm"" is translated to three reds.
- With this pattern, we can see that regardless of the word preceding ""walm,"" it causes a repetition of the associated color three times.

Thus, walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,83,walm
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the meaning of ""walm"" seems to be related to the repetition of a color corresponding to the previously mentioned color-coded word. Each individual word directly preceding ""walm"" has an associated color, as follows:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red

In the examples, ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color code of the word that appears right before it. It does not matter how many different color-coded words are there; ""walm"" specifically repeats the color of the word it directly follows. Hence, we can conclude:

walm -> Repeat the color of the word before ""walm"".

Rule: If x is the color-coded word that comes immediately before ""walm"", the output will contain multiple instances of the color associated with x, with the quantity of repetition in the examples being three.

For ""wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to red, and so ""walm"" results in ""red red red"". For the sequence ""lug wif zup wif walm"", the word ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to red, thus the output for ""walm"" is ""red red red"".",1.0,83,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we'll analyze the patterns within the given examples:

- In the first example, ""walm"" corresponds to three reds followed by a green.
- In the second example, ""walm"" corresponds to three reds.
- In the third example, ""walm"" again corresponds to three reds.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" corresponds to three reds.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" corresponds to three reds followed by a yellow (the presence of ""zup"" after ""walm"" changes the sequence).

- In the second example, ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow"" precedes ""bluf"", so ""bluf"" becomes ""yellow"". 
- In the third example, ""zup"" (yellow) precedes ""bluf"", resulting in another ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" (green) comes before ""bluf"", and ""bluf"" is also ""green"".
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" (yellow) precedes ""bluf"", and thus ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"".

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes bluf.",1.0,84,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the second word in each input and its corresponding color in the output:

1. Input: lug dax **bluf**
   Output: blue green **green**

2. Input: dax wif zup **bluf** wif walm
   Output: green red yellow **yellow** red red red

3. Input: wif dax zup **bluf**
   Output: red green yellow **yellow**

4. Input: zup dax **bluf**
   Output: yellow green **green**

5. Input: zup **bluf** dax lug
   Output: yellow **yellow** green blue

In examples 1, 4, and 5, the word that comes before ""bluf"" is the same word that comes after ""bluf"" (dax, dax, zup), and the corresponding output color for ""bluf"" matches the color that is produced by the repeated word (green for dax, yellow for zup).

In examples 2 and 3, the word right before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" and the corresponding output color for ""bluf"" is yellow, which is the same color that ""zup"" translates to in the output.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> The color word that follows or precedes it, if the second word is the same before and after bluf.

Thus:
bluf -> The repeated color word associated with the second word if it appears both before and after ""bluf"". If ""bluf"" is followed by a different word, it takes the color associated with the immediate preceding second word.",1.0,84,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's focus on where it appears and how the output correlates to the other words' outputs.

1. Whenever 'bluf' appears after 'dax', the output color is green twice.
2. When 'bluf' appears after 'wif' or 'zup', the output is yellow followed by the color corresponding to the following word ('wif' corresponds to red, 'dax' to green, 'lug' to blue).

Using this information, we can develop a potential rule that 'bluf' mirrors the color of the word before it in the sequence, except when it's after 'zup', where instead it seems to just turn yellow regardless of the preceding color.

Rule:
bluf -> If the preceding word is 'dax', then bluf corresponds to green. If the preceding word is 'zup', then bluf corresponds to yellow. If 'bluf' follows any other word, it mirrors the color of that word.",0.8,84,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs and look at where ""bluf"" appears.

From the examples:

1. When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"", the corresponding output is blue followed by green.
2. Whenever ""dax"" follows or precedes ""bluf"", the output is invariably green followed by green.
3. When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and is followed by ""walm"", the output for ""bluf"" is yellow.
4. We notice ""wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow"", here ""wif"" maps to ""red"" and ""bluf"" to yellow again.
5. In the last case, ""zup bluf dax lug"", ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""dax"" and ""lug"", with the corresponding output ""yellow yellow green blue"". We can deduce that ""bluf"" in this position leads to ""yellow"".

Based on the patterns, ""bluf"" seems to take on the value of yellow when preceded by ""zup"" or ""wif"" and green when followed or preceded by ""dax"". So ""bluf"" changes its meaning depending on the preceding word:

Rule: If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" or ""wif"", the output is yellow. If ""bluf"" is preceded or followed by ""dax"", the output is green. If ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"", the output is blue.

However, further examples would be needed to fully confirm and understand the rule(s) governing ""bluf"" and whether it has fixed meanings or if there are any other conditions affecting its output beyond the surrounding words.",0.7,84,bluf
"Rule: The word ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it. If the preceding word is ""lug,"" the color is blue. Therefore, ""walm"" after ""lug"" would be blue repeated for the number of ""walm"" instances.",1.0,84,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" is associated with a sequence of the color ""green"" in the first example, and the color ""blue"" in the subsequent appearances. However, after more careful observation, we can deduce that ""walm"" potentially means to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the evidence:

- In the first example, ""dax"" means ""green,"" and ""walm"" leads to repeated ""green"" outputs.
- In the second example, ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and ""walm"" leads to repeated ""blue"" outputs immediately after.
- The third example again shows ""wif"" as ""red,"" followed by repeated ""red"" outputs with ""walm.""
- The fourth example has ""zup"" as ""yellow,"" followed by multiple ""yellow"" outputs after ""walm.""
- The fifth example doesn't give us a different color before ""walm,"" but since ""lug"" is consistent with ""blue,"" we again see a repetition of ""blue"" after ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,84,walm
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it.,1.0,84,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we need to observe patterns between the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

Input: wif lug dax walm 
Output: red blue green green green

In this example, we notice that the color green is repeated thrice following the occurrence of ""walm,"" suggesting ""walm"" may represent the repetition of the preceding color, which in this case is green.

Input: dax lug walm zup wif 
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

Here, ""walm"" is followed by the repetition of the color blue, and ""zup wif"" after ""walm"" produces different colors, so their presence doesn't seem to affect the repetition.

Input: zup bluf wif walm 
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Again, ""walm"" is followed by the repetition of the preceding color, which is red in this case.

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf 
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

We again see a repetition of yellow following ""walm,"" denoting the color before it.

Input: lug walm 
Output: blue blue blue

No new color is introduced after ""walm,"" so the repetition of blue continues for the rest of the output string.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. We can define the rule as:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word in the output.",0.9,84,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can look at the correlation between its occurrence and the color that appears in the output. Each instance of ""walm"" is followed exclusively by the color ""green"" or ""blue.""

In the first example, after ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green."" In the second example, ""walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue."" In the third example, ""walm"" results in ""red red red."" But considering other inputs, ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"" also affect the color output. These words likely represent ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" and ""green"" respectively.

Looking at patterns, it's evident that ""lug"" consistently correlates with ""blue."" After ""walm,"" the output always corresponds to a color repeated three times. Therefore, ""walm"" could signify a triple repetition of the previously mentioned color.

However, there's inconsistency in the final example because ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" which doesn't quite fit the pattern. But since ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" it could simply mean that ""walm"" repeats the previous color thrice.

Rule: walm -> causes the previous color mentioned to be repeated three times.",0.8,84,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Each instance of the word ""lug"" in the input results in the word ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the position in the sequence or surrounding words.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,85,lug
"Based on the input and output patterns, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Hence, we can deduce that:

Rule:

"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue."" Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" is in the corresponding output position. Additionally, ""wif"" seems to consistently correspond to ""red,"" and ""walm"" to a sequence of ""blue"" followed by ""red red,"" though with the examples given, the pattern for ""walm"" might need more examples for a definitive rule.

5. Input: dax wif  
   Output: green red

Rule: zup -> yellow.

Each time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow"". Here's the breakdown for clarity:

- ""zup bluf lug"" converts to ""yellow yellow blue"" because ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" is transformed into another ""yellow"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
  
- ""lug zup lug"" becomes ""blue yellow blue"", with ""zup"" again mapping to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" on both sides transforming to ""blue"".

- ""dax zup bluf"" turns into ""green yellow yellow"" with ""dax"" converting to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" to another ""yellow"".

- ""zup lug wif"" converts to ""yellow blue red"", with ""zup"" being ""yellow"", ""lug"" as ""blue"", and ""wif"" as ""red"".

- ""zup dax zup wif"" maps to ""yellow green yellow red"", where both instances of ""zup"" correspond to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""wif"" to ""red"".

- The pattern holds for all other examples where ""bluf"" follows a color and the output repeats that color twice.

"walm -> repetition of the color associated with the previous word. Rule: The sequence of colors repeats the color associated with the word that precedes ""walm"" for a count of three times. For instance:

- ""lug walm"" → ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" is associated with blue, and it is repeated three times after ""walm"".
- ""dax wif walm"" → ""green red red red"" because ""wif"" is associated with red, and it is repeated three times following ""walm"".
- ""zup walm"" → ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and it is repeated three times after ""walm"". 

Hence, the word ""walm"" in the context of the provided examples indicates that the output should repeat the color linked to the word that comes directly before ""walm"", and this repetition should occur three times.",1.0,85,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to dictate a repetition of the color related to the nonce word that precedes it. Specifically, ""walm"" seems to cause the output to repeat the associated color word three times. 

The association between the nonce words and colors appears to be as follows:

- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue""
- ""dax"" is associated with ""green""
- ""wif"" is associated with ""red""
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow""

Thus, when ""walm"" follows any of those nonce words, the output contains the corresponding color word three times in a row. We can then derive the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the preceding color-associated nonce word to be translated into its respective color word repeated three times in the output.

Using this rule:

- lug walm -> blue blue blue
- dax wif walm -> green red red red
- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow 
- wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
- zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow green blue

So, the meaning of ""walm"" in the context of these examples seems to be ""repeat the preceding color word three times.""

walm -> repeat the preceding color word three times.",1.0,85,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of color words. The number of times the color is repeated corresponds to the number of syllables in the preceding word. Here is how the rule applies to each example:

1. lug walm -> blue blue blue (since ""lug"" has one syllable, ""blue"" is repeated three times)
2. dax wif walm -> green red red red (since ""wif"" has one syllable, ""red"" is repeated three times)
3. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow (since ""zup"" has one syllable, ""yellow"" is repeated three times)
4. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue (each color is repeated based on the syllables in the word preceding ""walm"")
5. zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow green blue (each color corresponds to the syllables in the word before ""walm"")

Based on this pattern, the rule that can be deduced is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word a number of times equal to the syllables in the preceding word.",1.0,85,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each input and its corresponding output to identify a pattern.

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

2. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

4. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

5. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

Analyzing the inputs with their outputs, we can identify the following patterns:

- After ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue"", which is the word ""blue"" repeated three times.
- After ""dax wif,"" the output is ""green red red red"", which includes the word ""red"" repeated three times but preceded by ""green"".
- After ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"", which is the word ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- In the longer string, ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"", each instance of ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it: after ""wif,"" ""red red red""; after ""lug,"" ""blue blue blue"".

From these patterns, it seems that ""walm"" prompts the output to repeat the color word that directly precedes it three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears after a word, the output repeats the corresponding color of that word three times.

walm -> Repeat the color word that precedes ""walm"" three times.",1.0,85,walm
"From the examples provided, we can deduce some rules about the word ""walm"" and its relationship to the other words. Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

2. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

4. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

5. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

Observing the patterns, we can make the following associations:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

When ""walm"" follows these words, the output is a repetition of the corresponding color with a length equal to the output length minus one (since ""walm"" itself does not correspond to a color in the output).

Let's check this rule with Example 4:

- ""wif"" appears twice before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""red"", hence ""red red red"".
- Following ""walm"", ""dax"" gives ""green"".
- Next, ""zup"" gives ""yellow"".
- Another ""wif"" gives ""red"".
- Finally, ""lug walm"" provides us with ""blue blue blue"".

Putting this all together, we get ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue"", which matches the output in Example 4.

Based on the observations, we can determine the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm, when following a color-associated word, repeats that color's output N-1 times where N is the given number of repetitions if ""walm"" were not there. ""Walm"" itself does not map to an output color.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: walm acts as a repeater for the previous color word's output, repeating its corresponding color except for the last repetition.",0.9,85,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: Each time the word ""lug"" appears in the inputs, it translates to the color ""blue"" in the outputs.",1.0,86,lug
"Observing the inputs and the corresponding outputs, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Regardless of its position in the sequence, ""lug"" corresponds to the same color. There doesn't seem to be any dependency on context or surrounding words for the meaning of ""lug."" Hence, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,86,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,86,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

Here's the breakdown of the rule induction:

- In every instance where ""lug"" is mentioned, the output consistently contains the color blue.
- When other words are repeated (like ""zup"" or ""wif""), they correspond to different colors (yellow and red), but ""lug"" remains consistently associated with blue.

Given the information, here is the rule:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,86,lug
"Rule: lug -> blue

Backing this up with the evidence from the examples:

- In the first example, ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" maps to ""yellow blue red green green red,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". Since ""lug"" is between ""zup"" (yellow) and ""wif"" (red), it translates to ""blue"".
  
- In the second example, ""zup lug walm"" maps to ""yellow blue blue blue"". Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" again, and ""lug"" appears immediately after, it stands to reason ""lug"" corresponds to the first ""blue"". The repetition of ""blue blue blue"" could be implied by ""walm"", but ""lug"" distinctly matches ""blue"" here.

- The third example, ""lug wif walm,"" gives us ""blue red red red"". We already established ""wif"" as ""red"", so ""lug"" must correspond to ""blue"".

- The fourth and fifth examples also support this, as we see ""lug"" consistently mapped to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,86,lug

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the provided examples. Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output.",1.0,86,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the pattern in which it appears and the corresponding output colors.

1. wif bluf -> red red
2. dax walm wif -> green green green red
3. dax wif lug -> green red blue
4. zup dax wif -> yellow green red
5. wif lug dax -> red blue green

From these examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. 

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red,1.0,86,wif
"Based on the provided examples, ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" 

Here's the breakdown:

- In every Output where ""wif"" appears in the Input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the Output.
- The examples show different words preceding or following ""wif,"" but regardless of its position, the output color for ""wif"" remains consistent.

Rule:
wif -> red",1.0,86,wif
"Based on the examples provided and the output associated with each input, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

So the rule induction would be:

wif -> red",1.0,86,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it is evident that the nonce word ""zup"" correlates with a color. In each example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" To detail this more systematically, let's examine each example:

1. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   
2. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow
   
3. Input: zup dax bluf zup dax

4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   
5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

Consistently across these examples, each occurrence of ""zup"" results in the color ""yellow"" in the output. The presence of ""zup"" does not depend on its position in the input sequence, nor on the neighboring words – it invariably corresponds to the output ""yellow"" each time it appears.

Rule:
zup -> yellow",1.0,86,zup
"Analyzing the provided examples, we notice that the output is a sequence of colors corresponding to the input sequence which includes the nonce word 'zup'. To determine the meaning or rule behind 'zup', we'll review the consistent pattern apparent in each example.

- In the first example, 'zup' precedes the words 'lug' and 'walm', which both correspond to the color 'yellow'.
- In the second example, 'zup' directly precedes 'dax', which corresponds to 'green'.
- In the third example, 'zup' precedes 'dax' and is followed by 'bluf'. 'Dax' corresponds to 'green' and 'bluf' to 'green' as well, with 'zup' resulting in 'yellow'.
- In the fourth example, 'zup' precedes 'walm', which corresponds to 'yellow'.
- In the fifth example, 'zup' comes after 'wif' and before 'bluf', with 'wif' corresponding to 'red' and 'bluf' to 'green', with 'zup' resulting in 'yellow'.

From this analysis, it appears that the word 'zup' consistently corresponds to the color 'yellow', regardless of the position it appears in the sequence or the words that come before or after it.

Thus, the rule is:

zup -> yellow",1.0,86,zup
"From the provided examples, we can observe the color outputs corresponding to the presence of the word ""zup"" and other words in the inputs. Here's the analysis based on the examples:

- In the first example, ""zup"" appears twice: once after ""lug"" and once after ""dax."" These are followed by the color ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" follows ""dax"" and is associated with the color ""yellow.""
- The third example has ""zup"" occurring twice: before and after ""bluf,"" which is associated with the color ""green,"" with ""zup"" outputs being ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" only appears once after ""lug"" and outputs ""yellow.""
- The fifth example contains ""zup"" after ""wif,"" and before ""bluf"" (which is ""green""), and the output is ""yellow.""

From this, we can determine that the presence of ""zup"" in the input consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output regardless of its position or the words around it.

Hence, the rule can be stated as: zup -> yellow.",1.0,86,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe that the occurrence of the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output sequence.

Therefore, we can deduce that the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,86,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that, to some extent, the word ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow."" However, the meaning of ""zup"" might be influenced by its position or the surrounding words because, in the fourth example, ""zup"" is translated to ""blue."" To determine a consistent rule, let's analyze the examples.

Analyzing the examples:

1. wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
2. dax zup -> green yellow
3. zup dax bluf zup dax -> yellow green green yellow green
4. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
5. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red

From examples 1, 2, 3, and 5, wherever ""zup"" appears, it translates to ""yellow."" However, in example 4, ""zup"" appears after ""lug"" and translates to ""blue"" instead of ""yellow."" This suggests a possible rule in which ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" unless it directly follows ""lug,"" in which case it translates to ""blue.""

Rule: zup translates to ""yellow"" unless it directly follows the word ""lug,"" in which case it translates to ""blue.""

Therefore:

zup -> yellow, except after ""lug"" when it becomes blue.",0.8,86,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to correlate with the duplication of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. Here are the associations made in accordance with the examples:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

For each example:

- ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red"" (Here ""bluf"" duplicates the color for ""zup"" which is ""yellow."")
- ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow blue green blue"" (Here ""bluf"" duplicates the color for ""zup"" which is ""yellow."")
- ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow"" (Here ""bluf"" duplicates the color for ""zup"" which is ""yellow."")
- ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red"" (Here ""bluf"" duplicates the color for ""wif"" which is ""red."")
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"" (Here ""bluf"" duplicates the color for ""zup"" which is ""yellow."")

So, based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> replicate the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before bluf.

Thus:

bluf -> duplicate the color/name of the prior word.",1.0,86,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> yellow

Each instance of ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output. Regardless of the position of ""bluf"" within the input sequence, it consistently translates to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,86,bluf
"bluf -> repeats the color associated with the word that comes immediately before bluf.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another nonce word, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated the same number of times as the color of that word. If the preceding word is ""zup,"" the color ""yellow"" is outputted twice, as ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".",1.0,86,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can analyze the given examples and the corresponding outputs. Here's a breakdown:

- In every example where ""bluf"" appears, the word ""yellow"" is repeated in the output.
- The number of times ""yellow"" is repeated in the output corresponds to the position of ""bluf"" in the input (e.g., when ""bluf"" is the second word, ""yellow"" is repeated twice).
- The word ""bluf"" is not directly matched to a color in the outputs unlike other words such as ""wif"" (red) or ""lug"" (blue).

Considering these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" indicates a command to repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""bluf"" in the input.

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,86,bluf
"To determine the rule governing the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should consider the pattern in the outputs when the word ""bluf"" is present and when it is not.

The word ""bluf"" appears in every input sequence provided. For each appearance of ""bluf,"" the corresponding output always includes a sequence of the word ""yellow."" Furthermore, the number of times ""yellow"" appears in the output seems to be directly related to the position of ""bluf"" within the input sequence.

Let's examine the occurrences of ""bluf"":

1. ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" which is two repetitions of ""yellow.""
2. ""zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow red red red.""
3. ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" results in ""yellow yellow blue green blue.""
4. ""dax zup bluf"" results in ""green yellow yellow,"" where ""yellow"" appears twice, following ""green.""
5. ""zup wif bluf"" results in ""yellow red red,"" with two repetitions of ""yellow"" following ""red.""

Based on these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" translates twice to the word ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position within the sequence. The word immediately following ""bluf"" also appears in the output, and the first word of the sequence corresponds to a color that is not ""yellow"" in the output.

Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that, irrespective of its position, it results in two ""yellows"" in the output. The rest of the output follows a pattern that associates each non-""bluf"" word with a specific color in the output.

Rule: bluf -> ""yellow yellow""",0.8,86,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we have to look for patterns in the given examples and their corresponding outputs. Here's the analysis for each input and output pair:

Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
- Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to be repeated three times as ""yellow.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""Dax"" leads to ""green,"" and ""walm"" is repeated three times as ""green.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- This is a repetition of the second example and confirms the pattern observed for ""dax"" and ""walm.""

Input: zup wif dax walm
Output: yellow red green green green
- ""Zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""walm"" following ""dax"" yields three times ""green.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- Another confirmation of the pattern for ""dax"" and ""walm.""

Based on the outputs for each input where ""walm"" is present, the following pattern can be deduced:

Rule: The word ""walm"" repeats the color preceding it three times.

Therefore, we can say:

walm -> meaning. The word ""walm"" causes the color word that precedes it to be repeated three times in the output.",1.0,86,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" consistently results in multiple green outputs. The number of greens corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" appears in the input. As shown by the patterns:

- ""zup walm lug"" produces one blue (likely for ""lug"") and three yellows (likely for ""zup"") followed by a green for ""walm"".
- ""dax walm"" produces three greens, and since ""dax"" appears only once, it indicates ""dax"" may not correspond to a specific number of greens.
- ""zup wif dax walm"" results in a red (presumably for ""wif""), a yellow (for ""zup""), and three greens following ""dax walm"", but since ""walm"" is only said once, the number of greens does not depend on the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned.

Given that the multiple greens always follow the word ""walm"" and do not seem to be influenced by the word preceding ""walm"", we can hypothesize that ""walm"" corresponds specifically to the action of producing the color green three times, regardless of what precedes it.

Rule: walm -> produce the color green three times.",1.0,86,walm
"Based on the provided examples, ""walm"" appears to result in a repeated color based on the word that precedes it. Here's how the rule can be broken down based on the given inputs and outputs:

- ""zup walm lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" where ""zup"" seems to correlate with the color ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" results in the repetition of ""yellow"" three times before ""lug"" introduces a new color, ""blue.""
- ""dax walm"" consistently results in ""green green green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green,"" and ""walm"" leads to its thrice repetition.
- The repetition in the ""dax walm"" examples strengthens the consistency of this rule.
- ""zup wif dax walm"" leads to ""yellow red green green green,"" with ""zup"" correlating to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" followed by ""dax,"" which correlates to ""green,"" with ""walm"" causing ""green"" to repeat three times.

Given these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. The repeated color is stated three times. Thus:

Rule: walm -> Triggers the repetition of the previously mentioned color three times.",0.9,86,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to repeated instances of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Here's the breakdown according to each input and output:

- ""zup walm lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue"". ""Zup"" precedes ""walm"" and is represented by three yellows, so ""zup"" seems to mean ""yellow.""

- ""dax walm"" (repeated in three examples) corresponds to ""green green green"" each time, suggesting ""dax"" means ""green.""

- ""zup wif dax walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red green green green"". ""Zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, and ""dax walm"" leads to three greens, implying ""dax"" is green and ""walm"" causes the triple repetition of the color associated with the word before ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be: repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",0.9,86,walm
"Based on the outputs provided with respect to the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" in the input, it appears that ""walm"" results in a repetition of a color word. The number of repetitions corresponds to the number of words in the input before ""walm.""

For example:
- ""zup walm lug"" has three words before ""walm,"" resulting in ""yellow"" being repeated three times, followed by a color not associated with ""walm"", which is ""blue.""
- ""dax walm"" has one word before ""walm,"" resulting in ""green"" being repeated three times.

The color that is repeated seems to be associated with the word that comes immediately before ""walm"":
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""

Therefore, we can infer that ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to be repeated according to the number of words that precede ""walm.""

2. The third example, ""dax zup wif zup,"" outputs ""green yellow red yellow,"" indicating that ""dax"" is ""green"" and confirming that ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""

3. The fourth example is just ""wif"" with the output being ""red,"" which confirms our earlier observation that ""wif"" translates directly to ""red.""

4. The fifth example, ""zup lug walm wif walm,"" outputs ""yellow blue blue red red red."" Here ""zup"" is consistent with ""yellow,"" and we can observe that each ""walm"" seems to be doubling the occurrence of the following word. Therefore, one ""walm"" before ""wif"" creates a doubling effect of ""wif"" which is ""red,"" making it ""red red,"" and a ""walm"" before that adds another ""blue"" to ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

Based on these outputs, the rule seems to be: the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red,"" and adjacent words define other colors, with ""walm"" having a doubling effect on the subsequent outputs.

- When ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red.""
- When ""wif"" follows other words, such as ""dax zup wif zup"" or ""zup lug walm wif walm,"" ""red"" appears in the output after generating colors for the preceding words.
- There is no instance where ""wif"" is followed by any other words. Therefore, the effect of ""wif"" on subsequent words (if any) cannot be determined.

"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let us look for patterns between the input and the output:

Input: dax wif bluf | Output: green red red
- In this case, ""bluf"" is still corresponding to ""red"" but is preceded by ""wif"" -> ""red"" and ""dax"" -> ""green.""

Input: zup dax bluf | Output: yellow green green
- Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" not ""red,"" and is preceded by ""dax,"" which matches with ""green.""

Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif | Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
- In this longer sequence, ""bluf"" corresponds first to ""blue,"" then to ""yellow,"" and both times is directly preceded by the word that corresponds to the same color in the output.

From the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> The same color as the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""",1.0,87,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be as follows:

If ""bluf"" follows a color-coded word, its color is the same as the preceding color-coded word. If ""bluf"" is the first in a sequence, it defaults to ""red"".

Let's examine the examples to deduce the rule:

1. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   Here, ""wif"" translates to ""red"". The word ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and also translates to ""red"".

2. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", so it translates to ""red"".

3. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red
   ""dax"" translates to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""bluf"" again follows ""wif"", meaning ""red"".

4. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green
   ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", so it translates to ""green"".

5. Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif

   Here, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" so it is ""blue"", the next ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""bluf"" then follows ""zup"" which makes it ""yellow"", and finally ""wif"" is ""red"".

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the preceding color-coded word; if it's the first color-coded word, default to red.",1.0,87,bluf

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs in relation to their inputs, looking for patterns related to the word ""walm.""

From the first example:

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

The pattern for ""zup"" appears to correlate with ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" with ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" with ""red."" The word ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" and the output repeats ""red"" two more times. This might suggest that ""walm"" refers to some sort of repetition, but we need more evidence.

From the second example:

Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

Here, ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" again, as observed in the first example. The words ""walm"" and ""lug"" follow, resulting in ""yellow blue."" It appears that ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""zup"" to repeat before moving to the next color. In this case, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""

From the third example:

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

The word ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""zup bluf"" both with ""yellow,"" as previously established. The sequence ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" again indicating that ""walm"" has caused a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, ""wif.""

From the fourth example:

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

Here, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and it is followed by ""walm,"" which results in two additional ""blue,"" and then ""dax"" changes the color to ""green."" The ""walm"" again seems to be responsible for repeating the color associated with the word just before it.

From the last example:

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red

In this sequence, ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" causing the color ""green"" to be repeated twice more before moving on to ""lug"" and ""wif,"" which correlate with ""blue"" and ""red,"" respectively.

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" probably means to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it two additional times. Thus:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color related to the previous word two more times.",1.0,87,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before ""walm"". To confirm the rule, let's examine the instances of ""walm"" in the examples:

1. ""zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow red red red"". Here, ""wif"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""red"", hence ""red"" is repeated three times.
2. ""zup walm lug"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow blue"". ""Zup"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""yellow"", making ""yellow"" repeat three times.
3. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" gives ""green red yellow yellow red red red"". In this example, ""wif"" comes before ""walm"" and aligns with ""red""; again we see that ""red"" is repeated three times.
4. ""lug walm dax"" produces ""blue blue blue green"". Here, ""lug"" is before ""walm"" and matches ""blue"", resulting in ""blue"" being repeated three times.
5. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" yields ""yellow green green green blue red"". In this case, ""dax"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""green"", hence ""green"" is repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the word immediately before it to repeat three times.",1.0,87,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns in the examples given:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

2. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

3. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

4. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green

5. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red

From the examples provided, we can notice that each word in the input seems to correspond to a color in the output. Analyzing the pattern for ""walm"":

- In example 1, ""walm"" appears after ""wif"" and the output for ""walm"" is two reds, which seems to be one more than the single red for ""wif.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output is three yellows, which is one more than the two yellows for ""zup.""
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" again and results in three reds, which is again one more than the red for the ""wif"" that comes right before it.
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output is three blues, which is one more than the blue for ""lug.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is three greens, which is one more than the green for ""dax.""

From this analysis, we can derive a rule that ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated once more than it is without ""walm.""

So, the rule is: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word one additional time.",1.0,87,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each input example and the corresponding output, breaking them down to find a pattern.

1. zup (yellow) bluf (yellow) wif (red) walm -> yellow yellow red red red
2. zup (yellow) walm lug -> yellow yellow yellow blue
3. dax (green) wif (red) zup (yellow) bluf (yellow) wif (red) walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red
4. lug (blue) walm dax -> blue blue blue green
5. zup (yellow) dax (green) walm lug (blue) wif (red) -> yellow green green green blue red

From these examples, we can see that ""walm"" produces multiple colors in the output, extending the color that precedes it (except for in example 4, where ""walm"" comes before ""dax"" and turns green, which is the color associated with ""dax""). Thus, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word before it or changes to the color associated with the following word if ""walm"" is the preceding word.

Let's apply this rule:

1. ""wif walm"" turns into ""red red red,"" which means ""walm"" repeated the red from ""wif.""
2. No color word before ""walm,"" but it is followed by ""lug"" (blue), and ""walm"" produced two yellows before changing to blue, which is associated with ""lug.""
3. ""wif walm"" once again turns into ""red red red"" after the initial ""wif"" (red).
4. ""lug (blue) walm"" turns into ""blue blue blue,"" repeating the blue, but when ""walm"" comes before ""dax"" (green), it turns to green.
5. ""dax walm"" turns into ""green green green,"" repeating the green from ""dax,"" then following the pattern when encountering ""lug"" (blue), as seen in the second example where ""walm"" forecasts the color of the next word.

Rule:
walm -> meaning. If ""walm"" follows a color word, it repeats the color of that word multiple times. If ""walm"" precedes a color word, it adopts the color of the next word once, then continues with the output as if ""walm"" wasn't there.",0.8,87,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns of outputs relative to the inputs. We will consider each word in the examples and compare them to the color output sequences.

1. ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""
2. ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""
3. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
4. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Now let's look for patterns where ""walm"" is present:

- In the first example, the presence of ""walm"" after ""wif"" (red) results in two additional ""red""s instead of one.
- The second example ends with ""walm"" and results in a ""blue"" output, which usually corresponds to ""lug.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" produces the sequence ""red red red"" after ""wif"" once again.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and the output is green, which usually follows the word ""dax.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) twice, and it continues with green before it switches to a ""blue"" ""lug,"" then ""wif"" results in ""red.""

From these observations, it appears that ""walm"" has the effect of repeating the color output of the word just before it, with an apparent exception in the fourth example where it precedes ""dax."" Given the available examples, there seems to be a special rule applying to ""walm"" after ""lug,"" leading to ""green,"" or it could be the presence of ""dax"" after ""walm"" that overrides the repeat rule.

Based on this analysis, the tentative rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color output of the word just before it, with a potential exception or additional rule when ""lug"" comes before ""walm,"" followed by ""dax,"" which needs further examples to fully understand.

So:
walm -> meaning. Meaning: repeats the color output of the previous word.",0.8,87,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue regardless of its position in the sequence of words.",1.0,88,lug
"lug -> blue

"lug -> blue

Rule: Regardless of the context or the placement of the nonce word ""lug"" in the input, ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,88,lug
"Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in the outputs. ""Zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""wif"" corresponds to red. ""Bluf"" twice corresponds to green and once to yellow, which might suggest some context dependency for ""bluf,"" or potentially an inconsistency that requires more examples to resolve. 

However, sticking to the given task to deduce the meaning of ""dax"" specifically, we can conclude with the information provided that:

dax -> green

Rule: In the given context, the nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,88,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,88,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,88,dax
"Given the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rule associated with the nonce word ""dax."" We can break down the examples to see the pattern.

From the first example:
Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red

Here, ""dax"" follows ""zup,"" resulting in ""green"" following ""yellow.""

From the second example:
Input: dax zup
Output: green yellow

In this instance, ""dax"" appears before ""zup"" and results in ""green"" before ""yellow.""

From the third example:
Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green

Here again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" 

From the fourth example:
Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

Once again, ""dax"" ends up being related to the color ""green.""

From the fifth example:
Input: wif zup dax bluf
Output: red yellow green green

Each word seems to be associated with a specific color. ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" with green, and consistently, ""dax"" with ""green.""

From the examples, the rule seems clear that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position within the sequence of words.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,88,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,88,dax
"From the given input-output pairs, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding output. It is independent of its position in the list of nonce words.

Here is how it matches up:

- ""zup wif"" outputs ""yellow red,"" and since ""zup"" is not in any other input, it likely corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif lug dax"" outputs ""red blue green."" ""lug"" and ""dax"" are the new terms we haven't matched yet, and they likely correspond to ""blue"" and ""green,"" respectively.
- ""wif"" alone outputs ""red,"" confirming that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax wif"" outputs ""green red,"" which adheres to the order of colors following the order of nonce words, suggesting ""dax"" is ""green"" and confirming ""wif"" is ""red.""
- ""wif dax"" outputs ""red green,"" further supporting that ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" following the order of nonce words.

- Input: ""lug zup"" corresponds to Output: ""blue yellow""

Each time ""zup"" appears in an input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output, regardless of the position of ""zup"" within the input sequence. Other words in the examples correspond to different colors, such as ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" However, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""",1.0,88,zup
"Observing the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, we can try to discern a pattern for the nonce word ""bluf."" In each case, let's look at where ""bluf"" appears and the output that corresponds to it:

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" The output associated with ""bluf"" is also ""red.""

2. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
   Output: red red yellow red blue green
   - In this sequence, ""bluf"" again follows ""wif"" and has the output ""red."" It is consistent with the previous example.

3. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   - Now, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and this time the output for ""bluf"" is ""green.""

4. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
   - In this example, ""bluf"" follows both ""dax"" and ""zup"" in separate instances. After ""dax,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""zup,"" it corresponds to ""yellow.""

5. Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
   Output: red red blue green red
   - Again, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to ""red.""

From these observations, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it.

Therefore:
bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the color of the previous word in the sequence.",1.0,88,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the examples given and look for patterns that correspond to the output:

1. When the input is ""wif bluf,"" the output is ""red red."" Since ""wif"" appears to correspond to ""red"" based on all examples, the second ""red"" likely corresponds to ""bluf.""

2. In the second example, ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax,"" the output is ""red red yellow red blue green."" We have already established that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and we can see ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""Bluf"" is again followed by ""red"" in the output, reinforcing that ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

3. The third input, ""wif dax bluf,"" has the output of ""red green green."" Since ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" the output for ""bluf"" in this scenario is also ""green."" At first glance, this seems to contradict the previous examples, but if we consider that the color output might be dependent on the word that comes before ""bluf,"" we see that when ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green"" rather than ""red.""

4. For the fourth input, ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug,"" the output is ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue."" Notice that when ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green,"" and when ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red."" When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow.""

5. Lastly, ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" translates to ""red red blue green red."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug,"" and in the output, ""red"" precedes ""blue."" This does not provide additional information about the rule for ""bluf"" but is consistent with what we have seen before.

Based on this analysis, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""Bluf"" takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the input sequence. If ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red"") precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" is ""red""; if ""dax"" (green) precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" is ""green""; and if ""zup"" (yellow) precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" is:
bluf -> Takes the color of the word before it.",1.0,88,bluf
"Observing the provided examples, we can attempt to induce the rule for the nonce word ""bluf."" Here is the analysis step by step:

- In examples 1 and 3, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and is translated as ""red.""
- In example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and ""zup"" and is translated as ""red"" and ""yellow,"" respectively.
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and ""zup,"" resulting in ""green"" and ""yellow,"" respectively.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and ""lug,"" resulting in ""red"" and ""blue,"" respectively.

From this analysis, we can deduce that ""bluf"" does not correspond to a fixed color but instead takes on the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before bluf.",1.0,88,bluf
"Based on the provided examples where ""bluf"" appears and the corresponding outputs, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red"" consistently. However, in the second appearance of ""bluf,"" it yields a different color output than the first. This indicates that ""bluf"" might have its meaning influenced by context or position.

For example, in the second sequence:
- Input: ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"" 
- Output: ""red red yellow red blue green""

Here ""bluf"" is followed by the word ""zup"" and yields the color ""red"". In the same sequence, ""bluf"" precedes ""lug"" and becomes ""yellow"".

In another example:
- Input: ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug""
- Output: ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue""

The first ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and yields ""green,"" while the second ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and yields ""yellow"".

Given these observations, ""bluf"" seems to yield a color output that may depend on the preceding or following word. Analyzing further, we see that ""bluf"" does not yield ""red"" when it is immediately preceded by another color word—instead, the output is of the same color as the preceding word. 

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it yields ""red"" (""wif"" translating to ""red"").
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it yields ""yellow"" (""zup"" translating to ""yellow"").
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it yields ""green"" (""dax"" translating to ""green"").

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> Takes on the color of the preceding word. If preceded by ""wif,"" then ""red""; if by ""zup,"" then ""yellow""; if by ""dax,"" then ""green.""",0.9,88,bluf
Rule: bluf -> green,0.2,88,bluf
"walm -> repetition of the color associated with the previous word. Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" appears in the sequence, the color output is a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that appears immediately before ""walm"", repeated three times.

So, if we break down the examples:

Input: wif walm
- ""wif"" corresponds to red
- ""walm"" causes red to be repeated three times
Output: red red red

Input: dax walm zup lug
- ""dax"" corresponds to green
- ""walm"" causes green to be repeated three times
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
Output: green green green yellow blue

Input: lug walm wif bluf
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
- ""walm"" causes blue to be repeated three times
- ""wif"" corresponds to red
Output: blue blue blue red red (Note: ""bluf"" does not have a corresponding color output in the given examples, so it's ignored or unknown.)

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
- ""walm"" causes blue to be repeated three times
- ""dax"" corresponds to green
- ""wif"" corresponds to red
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to red
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

Input: zup walm
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
- ""walm"" causes yellow to be repeated three times
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Based on the above inductions, it appears that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of three times the color that is associated with the word before it.",1.0,88,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" results in the word immediately preceding it being translated to its corresponding color three times in the output. The words ""wif"", ""dax"", ""lug"", and ""zup"" correspond to the colors ""red"", ""green"", ""blue"", and ""yellow"", respectively. Therefore, when ""walm"" follows any of these words, that word's color is repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding word's corresponding color to be output three times.",1.0,88,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a rule for the meaning of ""walm"":

Whenever the word ""walm"" appears in the input, the corresponding output consists of a series of three identical colors. Furthermore, the color that is repeated three times matches the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"". To clarify:

- In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""red red red"". Here, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- In the second example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""green green green"". ""Dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the outputs contain ""blue blue blue"". ""Lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- In the final example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""Zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.

Rule: walm -> When ""walm"" appears, it causes the word before it to triple its corresponding color in the output.",1.0,88,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the next word's corresponding color to be repeated three times. Here's how the rule applies in each example:

- ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red"", so ""walm"" makes ""red"" repeat three times.
- ""dax walm zup lug"" produces ""green green green yellow blue"". ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and after ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated thrice.
- ""lug walm wif bluf"" has ""lug"" before ""walm"", which produces ""blue"". ""Blue"" is then repeated twice more, followed by ""wif"" - ""red"", and ""bluf"" does not have a color associated with it, suggesting that other words do not influence the pattern.
- ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" - ""lug"" before ""walm"" creates ""blue blue blue"", followed by ""dax"" (""green""), and two sequences of ""wif"" - ""red"", interspaced with ""lug"" - ""blue"".
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", meaning ""walm"" makes ""yellow"" repeat three times.

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeated three times the color associated with the following word.",1.0,88,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" when used in a sequence repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times. 

""walm"" -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

- ""wif walm"" -> ""wif"" is associated with red, so ""walm"" translates to ""red red red"".
- ""dax walm zup lug"" -> ""dax"" is associated with green, so ""walm"" translates to ""green green green"".
- ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> ""lug"" is associated with blue, so ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"".
- ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" -> ""lug"" is associated with blue, so ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"".
- ""zup walm"" -> ""zup"" is associated with yellow, so ""walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"".",1.0,88,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" let's examine the patterns in which it appears and its corresponding outputs.

Examining the examples:

1. ""zup wif lug"" -> ""yellow red blue""
2. ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"" -> ""red red yellow red blue green""
3. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
4. ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" -> ""blue green yellow green green green red""
5. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow""

Looking at the placement of ""lug"" and the color ""blue"" in each output, it seems that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue."" This stays true regardless of its position in the input sentence. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,89,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,89,lug
"From the examples provided, we can conclude that:

- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" is again linked to ""blue,"" irrelevant of its position in the sequence.
- The third example confirms that ""lug"" is ""blue"" regardless of repetition.
- The fourth example consistently associates ""lug"" with ""blue.""
- The fifth example also confirms that ""lug"" aligns with ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,89,lug
"Considering the inputs and their respective outputs, we can look for patterns to understand the meaning of the word ""lug."" By comparing the inputs with their outputs, we can deduce the following:

1. ""zup wif lug"" translates to ""yellow red blue."" Since ""zup"" and ""wif"" are consistent with ""yellow"" and ""red"" in other examples, we can deduce that ""lug"" likely means ""blue.""

2. In the second input, ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax,"" we see that ""wif"" still translates to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""Bluf"" is new, but based on its surroundings and the consistent output of other words, it is unrelated to ""lug."" Given this, we can still reason that ""lug"" means ""blue.""

3. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" Since there are no other words to compare against except ""lug"" and ""walm,"" which both result in ""blue,"" it's not definitive but still supports the idea that ""lug"" could mean ""blue.""

4. In ""lug dax zup dax walm wif,"" ""lug"" is followed by ""blue,"" which is again consistent, just as ""dax"" is to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" 

5. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" gives us ""green red red red blue yellow."" Here, every word retains its consistency regarding its translation (""dax"" to ""green,"" ""wif"" and ""walm"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow""), so ""lug"" should also retain its meaning of ""blue.""

Based on these comparisons, the rule is as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,89,lug
"To figure out the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" we need to look for patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs. Let's examine each input-output pair:

1. Input: zup wif lug
   Output: yellow red blue
In this line, ""lug"" corresponds to the last color ""blue"".

2. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
   Output: red red yellow red blue green
In this line, ""lug"" is followed by ""dax"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" again.

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
In this line, ""lug"" is the first word, repeated by the second word ""walm"" which all correspond to ""blue"".

4. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
Here, we can see that ""lug"" once again corresponds to ""blue"".

5. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
And finally, in this line, ""lug"" precedes ""zup"" and corresponds to ""blue"".

Considering all the examples and looking for consistency, we can deduce that no matter the position in the sequence or the words surrounding it, ""lug"" always corresponds to the color ""blue"".

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,89,lug
"dax -> green. Rule: The nonce word dax is consistently translated to the color ""green"" regardless of its position or the context within the given examples.",1.0,89,dax
"From analyzing the patterns between the inputs and outputs, ""dax"" seems to represent the color ""green"". Each occurrence of the word ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the sequence. The other words in the sequence correspond to other colors, for instance, ""wif"" is to red, ""walm"" repeatedly translates to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""bluf"" to blue.

Hence, the rule appears to be:
dax -> green",1.0,89,dax
"dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Every occurrence of ""dax"" results in an instance of ""green"" in the output sequence.",1.0,89,dax
"dax -> meaning. The meaning seems to be the color green.

Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is the word ""green"". This can be deduced from each example given, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input phrase, it consistently translates to ""green"" in the output.",1.0,89,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" acts as a modifier to produce ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string. The word following ""dax"" does not seem to directly influence the color that ""dax"" translates to, as ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" in the output sequence. Other words appear to correspond to specific colors as well (""wif"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" to ""red"" when not preceded by ""dax,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"").

Therefore, the rule for the word “dax” seems to be:

Rule: when ""dax"" is present in the input, it corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.

dax -> ""green""",1.0,89,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each instance of ""wif"" in the inputs matches to ""red"" in the outputs regardless of its position or the context within the sequence. Thus, the rule for ""wif"" seems consistent and independent of other factors.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,89,wif

"Based on the examples provided, wif consistently correlates with the color red in the output. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. There is no additional context implying that ""wif"" depends on the position or the surrounding words. Therefore, the rule seems to be quite straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,89,wif
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Each example shows that when the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow.""",1.0,89,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

The examples show that every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. This consistent one-to-one relationship suggests that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""",1.0,89,zup
"Based on the examples given and the corresponding outputs, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently correlates to the color ""yellow"" in the output. This can be determined by looking at each example where the word ""zup"" is present and noting the color that corresponds to its position in the output.

Rule:
zup -> yellow",1.0,89,zup
"Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.",1.0,89,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look for patterns in the inputs and outputs:

- In example 1, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""dax"" corresponds to green. ""Bluf"" also corresponds to yellow.
- In example 2, ""zup"" again corresponds to yellow. ""Dax"" remains green. ""Wif"" corresponds to red.
- In example 3, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- In example 4, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow at the end of the sequence. Other words correspond to the same colors like before.
- In example 5, ""zup"" again corresponds to yellow at the end of the sequence.

From these examples, it appears that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,89,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should first look for patterns within the provided examples. Here are some observations:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" is present in the input, ""blue"" is present in the output.
2. The presence of ""bluf"" does not alter the expected output for the other words (""lug"" outputs ""blue"", ""wif"" outputs ""red"", ""walm"" outputs ""red"", and ""dax"" outputs ""green"").
3. ""Bluf"" does not seem to alter the sequence of colours; instead, it seems to add its own corresponding output colour to the sequence without a specific position, suggesting it is not dependent on position in the input.

Given these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it directly translates to the colour ""blue"".

Rule: bluf -> blue",1.0,89,bluf
"Analyzing the sequences provided, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to a color in the output. When we see ""bluf"" in the input, a sequence of colors appears in the output, but the sequence of colors varies depending on the other words in the input. Let's break down the patterns:

- In every instance where ""bluf"" appears, the word immediately following it becomes a color in the output.
- When ""lug"" follows ""bluf,"" blue follows in the output.
- When ""wif"" follows ""bluf,"" red follows in the output.
- When ""dax"" follows ""bluf,"" green follows in the output.

Furthermore, the color indicated by the word right after ""bluf"" is repeated based on the number of words before ""bluf."" For example, in the input ""lug walm wif bluf,"" there are three words before ""bluf,"" which correlates to the three blue colors before the sequence of red colors initiated by ""wif.""

Applying this rule to other inputs confirms the pattern, even when ""bluf"" is not at the end:

- ""zup bluf lug"" -> two yellows (from ""zup"") before the blue (from ""lug"").
- ""dax bluf wif lug"" -> two greens (from ""dax"") before the red (from ""wif"") and then blue (from ""lug"").

There also seems to be consistency in the color that each word represents:
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""walm"" might represent the repeating of the color that follows it (all red).

Taking all of this into consideration, the rule for the word ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" indicates the start of a sequence where the color of the first word following ""bluf"" will be shown. The number of times this color is shown corresponds to the number of words preceding ""bluf"" in the input sequence. When there are multiple words after ""bluf,"" the sequence corresponds to the first word following it and subsequent words represent their own colors.

Therefore: bluf -> Changes the subsequent word into a sequence of colors, where the amount is determined by the number of words preceding ""bluf.""",0.9,89,bluf
"Analyzing the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" may influence the output based on its position and possibly the other words around it. By comparing the inputs and outputs, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule associated with ""bluf.""

1. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
2. zup bluf lug -> yellow yellow blue
3. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
4. wif bluf dax -> red red green
5. dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue

Here's the deduction analysis for each input sequence:

1. Since ""lug walm wif bluf"" translates to three blues followed by two reds, and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in other examples, ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""blue"" as well since it precedes a blue in the output. ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red"" as it's followed by two reds in the output. The presence of ""bluf"" does not give us additional information about its meaning in this example.

2. ""zup bluf lug"" generates two yellows followed by a blue. ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue."" Here ""bluf"" may correspond to ""blue,"" considering ""lug"" is also present and the output has ""yellow yellow blue"".

3. ""zup bluf wif walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow red red red,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""red"" as well. If we consider that ""bluf"" might mean that the color that follows ""bluf"" should be repeated once (as in the second example), in this case, ""wif"" was supposed to be red, so it is repeated twice.

4. ""wif bluf dax"" turns into ""red red green,"" where ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""dax"" is ""green."" It seems that ""bluf"" might result in the repetition of the color that follows, which would be ""red"" in this case.

5. ""dax bluf wif lug"" results in ""green green red blue."" Here ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" This example further suggests that ""bluf"" causes the color that follows to be repeated once.

Therefore, based on these examples:

Rule: ""bluf"" appears to cause the color word that follows it to be repeated once in the sequence. If the color word does not directly follow ""bluf"" (as in the case of ""lug walm wif bluf""), there's not enough information to determine the specific rule for that scenario. So the generalized rule seems to be: When ""bluf"" is immediately followed by a color word, that color word is repeated once in the output. If ""bluf"" is at the end with no color word following, it is currently indeterminate what the rule would be.

bluf -> Causes the following color word to be repeated once in the output sequence.",0.8,89,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the relationship between the input and output in each example.

1. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red

Here, we have three instances of ""blue"" before ""red red."" Since ""lug walm wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and we see ""blue blue blue"" preceding ""red red,"" it might be that ""bluf"" indicates a transition from one color to another. 

2. Input: zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue

In this example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is ""yellow yellow"" before ""blue."" ""Lug"" follows ""bluf,"" and we observe one ""blue"" in the output.

3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

Again, we notice that ""zup"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" and after ""bluf,"" the color changes. ""Wif walm"" after ""bluf"" results in ""red red red.""

4. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green

Here, ""wif"" is correlated with two instances of ""red"" and following ""bluf,"" we have a change in color to ""green,"" associated with ""dax.""

5. Input: dax bluf wif lug
   Output: green green red blue

In this example, ""dax"" correlates with ""green green,"" and after ""bluf,"" the output is ""red blue,"" with the colors associated with ""wif"" and ""lug,"" respectively.

From these examples, it appears that ""bluf"" acts as a transition signal between colors. When ""bluf"" is encountered in the input, the colors that follow it correspond to the colors associated with the subsequent words in the input sequence.

Rule:
bluf -> Indicates a transition to the colors associated with the words that follow it in the input sequence.",0.8,89,bluf

However, without further consistent context or patterns, it is rather challenging to determine a definitive rule. Here are the observations:

   - ""Zup"" translates to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, and ""walm"" repeats the color for ""lug"" (blue) three times, followed by ""wif"" as red and ""dax"" as green.

5. Input: dax walm zup -> Output: green green green yellow
   - ""Dax"" is green, ""walm"" repeats the color green three times, followed by the color for ""zup"" which is yellow.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the word immediately before it three times.",1.0,89,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetitive sequence of a color word that precedes it. To be more explicit, the word that comes right before ""walm"" determines the color that is to be repeated multiple times in the output. The number of repetitions of the color in the output is the same as the number of words that come after ""walm"" (including ""walm"" itself). Here are the rules deduced from the given examples:

1. In ""dax wif walm,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in ""red red red red"" (3 repetitions of ""red"" after ""walm"" plus the one instance in response to ""wif"" itself).
2. In ""wif walm,"" we see ""wif"" followed by ""walm,"" leading to ""red red red"" (2 repetitions of ""red"" after ""walm"" plus the one instance in response to ""wif"" itself).
3. In ""wif lug zup walm wif lug,"" ""zup"" comes before ""walm"" and translates to ""yellow,"" hence we get ""yellow yellow yellow"" after ""walm."" The other colors ""red"" and ""blue"" correspond to ""wif"" and ""lug,"" respectively, and appear outside the repeating pattern.
4. In ""zup lug walm wif dax,"" ""lug"" is the word before ""walm"" and translates to ""blue,"" resulting in ""blue blue blue"" following ""walm."" The rest of the sequence follows the translations of ""zup"" (yellow), ""wif"" (red), and ""dax"" (green) accordingly.
5. In ""dax walm zup,"" ""dax"" comes before ""walm"" and translates to ""green,"" leading to ""green green green"" after ""walm."" The last word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the conclusion is that ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to repeat as many times as there are words following ""walm"" (including ""walm""). So, the rule for ""walm"" would be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word as many times as there are words including and following ""walm"".",1.0,89,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be:

- ""walm"" takes on the color word that immediately precedes it in the sequence. If there is no color word before ""walm,"" the default color appears to be red.

Let's verify this rule with the given examples:

1. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
In this sequence, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and since ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it takes on the color ""red"" and is repeated three times, possibly indicating emphasis or plurality.

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
Here, ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" follows with no other color before it, so ""walm"" takes on ""red"" and is again repeated three times.

3. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
In this example, ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" The ""walm"" that follows takes the color ""yellow.""

4. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and thus ""walm"" takes on ""blue.""

5. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow
Here ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and ""walm"" takes this color.

Based on this analysis, the rule is:
Rule: ""walm"" -> ""walm"" replicates the color of the preceding color word. If there is no color word before ""walm,"" it defaults to red. Additionally, ""walm"" seems to indicate that the color word it takes on should be repeated three times.",1.0,89,walm
"walm -> meaning. Meaning can be repetitive of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm"". Rule:

Based on the provided examples:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red,"" which suggests that ""walm"" could mean repeating the color associated with ""wif"" three times, where ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

2. The same pattern is seen with ""dax"" preceding ""walm,"" where the output includes ""green"" repeated three times, again suggesting ""walm"" means three repetitions of the preceding color, as ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

3. When no word precedes ""walm"" (this case is not provided in examples, so it's an unknown condition), but considering the previous patterns, it could be assumed that ""walm"" needs a preceding word to determine its meaning.

4. In the case of ""zup lug walm wif dax,"" ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" and we see ""blue blue blue"" in the output, reinforcing the rule of tripling the preceding word's color.

Therefore, the rule seems to be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.",1.0,89,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze how its presence in a sentence modifies the output in comparison with the sentences where it doesn't appear:

1. ""dax wif walm"" results in ""green red red red.""
   ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""
   
2. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red.""
   Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

3. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" results in ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue.""
   Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

4. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue red green.""
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""
   
5. ""dax walm zup"" results in ""green green green yellow.""
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

When comparing sentences with and without ""walm,"" it seems that the presence of ""walm"" causes the color of the word that immediately precedes it to repeat for a certain number of times before continuing with the sequence. The number of repetitions matches the number of colors that follow the first instance of the repeated color. For example:

- In example 1, ""wif"" is red and its color repeats three additional times after ""walm"" is introduced.
- In example 4, ""lug"" is blue and its color repeats twice after ""walm.""

Based on this observation, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated for as many times as there are words (and associated colors) following it in the sequence, before resuming with the next colors.

Other words in the input determine other colors in the output, but ""dax"" consistently correlates with the color ""green"".",1.0,90,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. This is evident regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input or the words that surround it. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

"Based on the given examples and their outputs, I can induce the following rules:

- When the word ""dax"" appears on its own as an input, the output is a single color: ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is preceded or followed by other words, it translates to ""green"" in addition to other colors that must be represented by the other words.

Each word seems to translate to a particular color, and ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" Occurrences of other words correlate with the same color output each time, suggesting these words also represent specific colors.

Thus, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" is:

Rule: dax -> green. 

The presence of ""dax"" in any input sequence consistently results in the color ""green"" in the output sequence.",1.0,90,dax

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" is being used as a separator to indicate a switch in a sequence or to denote a change between elements in a list. In this case, it seems to translate to the word ""red"". However, ""wif"" itself is not simply substitutable with the word ""red,"" as it serves a specific function. It also seems to be related to the sequence or position between the other words, influencing the output color sequence. Let's look at each example.

- lug wif dax => blue red green: Here ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- zup wif bluf => yellow red red: Here ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" corresponds to red.

- dax wif zup dax => green red yellow green: ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and the final ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- wif lug dax lug => red blue green blue: The initial ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""lug"" is blue, ""dax"" is green, and the final ""lug"" is blue.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each instance of the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"". The word ""zup"" does not seem to change meaning based on its position in the sentence or the presence of other words. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow

This means that every time ""zup"" is mentioned, it should be translated or interpreted as ""yellow"".",1.0,90,zup

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow."" Regardless of the position of ""zup"" within the input string, the output consistently includes ""yellow"" in the corresponding position.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,90,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" acts as a signal that will transform the following words into specific colors:

- When ""zup"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output is a series of four ""green"" instances.
- When ""zup"" appears on its own, the output is a singular ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is a ""yellow"" followed by the next word's assigned color, ""blue.""
- In cases where ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow"" followed by as many ""green"" instances as there are occurrences of ""walm.""

The word that follows ""zup"" seems to determine the color output and the number of repetitions (four greens after ""dax,"" one blue after ""lug""). However, ""zup"" itself consistently translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and potentially alters the output color of the next word(s) in a specific pattern, which might be a sequence or a repetition based on the input structure.",0.8,90,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to connect the meaning of ""bluf"" to the color that represents the word immediately preceding it. To clarify, ""bluf"" replicates the color that corresponds to the preceding word in the sequence. Let's examine the examples to derive the rule:

1. wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow
   The word that comes before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color yellow, and ""bluf"" also translates to yellow.

2. dax zup lug bluf -> green yellow blue blue
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color blue, so ""bluf"" translates to blue.

3. wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue
   ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to the color red, making ""bluf"" also red.

4. wif bluf zup -> red red yellow 
   Once again, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which is red, so ""bluf"" is also red.

5. zup lug bluf -> yellow blue blue
   ""Bluf"" follows ""lug"" which is blue, so ""bluf"" becomes blue.

Rule: bluf -> The color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"".",1.0,90,bluf
"By comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs, we can notice a pattern that relates to the presence of the word ""bluf"" and the color that it translates to in the output:

1. In all cases where ""bluf"" appears, the color ""blue"" is present in the output.
2. ""Bluf"" does not directly correspond to ""blue"" every time; rather, it seems to duplicate the color that appears immediately before it (if there is one). For instance, in the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" hence the output ""blue blue."" In the fifth example, the pattern continues with ""blue blue."" However, in the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" takes on the value of ""red"" which is the color that corresponds to ""wif.""

This gives us the general rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the word that precedes it in the input. If ""bluf"" is the second word and follows ""wif,"" it corresponds to ""red."" If it comes after other colors, it simply duplicates the preceding color.

bluf -> meaning: Duplicate the color of the preceding word; if following ""wif,"" the meaning is ""red.""",1.0,90,bluf
"Analyzing the examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the word ""blue"" each time, except for one instance where ""bluf"" becomes ""red"". Each instance of ""bluf"" seems to correlate with the word preceding it.

In the first example, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and the corresponding output is ""blue"" after ""lug"" (which is ""blue""); hence ""bluf"" becomes ""yellow"". In the second and fifth examples, the same pattern occurs.

However, in the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" occurs after ""wif"" and the output is ""red"" both times, so it seems that it's not just the positional relationship but also the specific word before ""bluf"" that determines its color correspondence.

Based on each instance:

1. ""lug"" (blue) before ""bluf"" -> ""bluf"" outputs ""blue"".
2. ""zup"" (yellow) before ""bluf"" -> ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow"".
3. ""dax"" (green) before ""bluf"" -> ""bluf"" outputs ""blue"".
4. ""wif"" (red) before ""bluf"" -> ""bluf"" outputs ""red"".
5. ""bluf"" following ""wif"" (red) -> ""bluf"" outputs ""red"".

From these examples, a tentative rule is that ""bluf"" takes on the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it, with an exception when it follows ""wif"", where it becomes ""red"" specifically, despite the color associated with ""wif"" being ""red"".

Rule: ""bluf"" typically takes the color of the word directly before it, with the exception that when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", it is ""red"".",0.8,90,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> ""red"" when it follows ""wif"", ""blue"" when it follows ""lug"" or ""zup"".",0.6,90,bluf
"bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each given example, regardless of its position within the input sequence.",0.0,90,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the instances of the nonce word ""walm"" and its corresponding output to understand what ""walm"" represents in terms of colors:

1. In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and results in ""blue blue.""
2. In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and results in ""red red.""
3. In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and again results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
4. In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) once more and results in ""blue blue.""
5. In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and the output is ""yellow yellow.""

From these observations, we can see that ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it. Each time ""walm"" is used, the color word corresponding to the preceding word is duplicated or triplicated. Therefore, the inferred rule is:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning: the nonce word ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color of the word that comes immediately before it.",1.0,90,walm
"walm -> repeated color of the previous word. Rule: Whenever the word ""walm"" appears in the sequence, it takes the color of the previous word and continues the pattern with that color.",1.0,90,walm
"walm -> meaning. 

Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" means the word following it should have its color repeated as many times as the word has occurred previously. Here is the rule based on the examples:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in a sequence, the color associated with the next word will be repeated in the output. The number of repetitions equals the number of times the following word has appeared in the input sequence, including the current instance.

Let's break it down for each example provided:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   Explanation: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" which has occurred once before making it twice in total.

2. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   Explanation: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" which has occurred once before making it twice in total.

3. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   Explanation: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" which has occurred twice before making it thrice in total.

4. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   Explanation: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" which has occurred once before making it twice in total.

5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   Explanation: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" which has occurred twice before making it thrice in total.",1.0,90,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to be repeated in the output sequence. Here's the rule broken down with respect to the color word that precedes ""walm"":

- Example 1: ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
- Example 2: ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
- Example 3: ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
- Example 4: ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
- Example 5: ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""

The rule appears to be that the word ""walm"" in the input triggers the repeating of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times in the output. If there is no color word directly before ""walm"", ""walm"" seems to take the color of the nearest preceding color word.

Applying this general rule, we can say:

walm -> meaning. Rule: Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times in the output sequence. If there's no immediate preceding color word, repeat the nearest preceding color.",1.0,90,walm
"By examining the provided examples and comparing the inputs with their respective outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or the rule of the nonce word ""walm.""

In the first input, ""walm"" occurs at the end and is followed by three instances of ""blue"" in the output, matching the preceding word ""lug,"" which is also translated to ""blue.""

In the second input, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which is translated to ""red"" in the output, and the corresponding output for ""walm"" is also ""red.""

In the third input, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is translated to ""yellow"" in the output, and the corresponding output for ""walm"" is ""yellow,"" repeated once for every previous occurrence of ""zup.""

In the fourth input, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, and the corresponding output for ""walm"" is ""blue,"" repeated for every previous occurrence of ""lug.""

In the fifth input, ""walm"" follows two occurrences of ""zup,"" and in the output, it corresponds to three repetitions of ""yellow,"" accounting for the previous occurrences of ""zup.""

Based on these observations, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to represent a repeating function. Specifically, ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat according to the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" with the number of repetitions equaling the number of times that color word has occurred before.

However, the task at hand is specifically to deduce the meaning of ""dax"", and based on the evidence provided, we can conclude:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,91,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" is included in the output.

2. In ""dax lug bluf dax,"" ""bluf"" again follows ""lug"" (""blue"") and is translated as ""blue.""
3. In ""dax bluf,"" ""bluf"" immediately follows ""dax"" (""green"") and translates to ""green.""
4. In ""wif dax bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (""green"") and translates to ""green.""
5. In ""wif bluf dax walm,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (""red"") and translates to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be:

bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the word that precedes it.",1.0,91,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Rule: The word ""bluf"" immediately repeats the color word that precedes it. If it is the first word or no color word precedes it, it defaults to green.",1.0,91,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green. Every time ""bluf"" is mentioned in the input, ""green"" is part of the output. Here is the analysis:

1. lug wif lug dax bluf -> blue red blue green green
2. dax lug bluf dax -> green blue green green
3. dax bluf -> green green
4. wif dax bluf -> red green green
5. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Therefore:
bluf -> green.",1.0,91,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" results in the output of two consecutive colors that correspond to the color mentioned just before ""bluf."" To clarify with examples:

- In the first example, ""lug wif lug dax bluf,"" the color before ""bluf"" is ""green,"" resulting in ""green green.""
- In the second example, ""dax lug bluf dax,"" the color before ""bluf"" is ""blue,"" resulting in ""blue blue.""
- In the third example, ""dax bluf,"" the color before ""bluf"" is ""green,"" again resulting in ""green green.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif dax bluf,"" the color before ""bluf"" is ""green,"" which once more results in ""green green.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf dax walm,"" the color before ""bluf"" is ""red,"" resulting in ""red red.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

bluf -> Repeat the color given before ""bluf"" twice.

Rule: bluf makes the preceding color word double up in the output.",1.0,91,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to directly correlate to repeating the color associated with the preceding word three times. Here is the observed pattern and the corresponding meanings:

- wif walm -> red red red
- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
- lug walm -> blue blue blue
- dax walm -> green green green

It appears that each word preceding ""walm"" is associated with a color:
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be defined as follows:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

Rule: If ""walm"" follows a word, output the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,91,walm
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to correspond to a repetition of the color associated with the word that directly follows it. If we assign each word a color based on the outputs provided, we can establish the following associations:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- bluf -> blue

Now, let's examine how ""walm"" interacts with the color-coded words:

1. Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is an immediate triple repetition of the color red.

2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   - Here ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is an immediate triple repetition of yellow followed by the single appearance of the color blue corresponding to ""lug"" and a double of red corresponding to ""wif.""

3. Input: lug walm zup lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   - In this input, ""walm"" follows different words: first ""lug,"" which results in a triple blue as output, and then later follows another ""lug,"" which again results in a triple blue.

4. Input: dax walm wif walm -> Output: green green green red red red
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" resulting in a triple green, and it follows ""wif,"" resulting in a triple red.

5. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   - In this sequence, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" resulting in a triple blue.

Therefore, from these observations, we can conclude that ""walm"" causes the color of the immediately following word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> the color of the following word is repeated three times.",1.0,91,walm
"Based on the provided examples, ""walm"" appears to replicate the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. For example:

- ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to green.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color associated with the previous word to be outputted three times in succession. 

Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,91,walm
"walm -> repeated color associated with the preceding word. Rule:

Based on the patterns observed in the examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""red red red"", suggesting that wif means red and when followed by ""walm"", the color red is said three times.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and ""lug"" at different instances. After ""zup"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"" and after ""lug"" it's ""blue blue blue"", implying that ""zup"" means yellow and ""lug"" means blue, with ""walm"" causing these colors to be repeated.
- The third example has ""lug walm"" and ""zup lug walm"", which results in ""blue blue blue"" and ""yellow blue blue blue"", reinforcing the rule that ""walm"" repeats the color.
- The fourth example features ""dax walm"" and ""wif walm"" leading to ""green green green"" and ""red red red"" outputs respectively, implying ""dax"" means green and ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color.
- In the fifth example, ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue"", which continues to support the rule that ""walm"" causes the previous color's name to be repeated three times. 

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,91,walm
"Based on the patterns observed in the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" is directly related to a color that is repeated three times. The specific color that ""walm"" represents changes depending on a word that immediately precedes it. From the examples, we can see the following relations:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""red red red"".
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue"".
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""green green green"".

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it translates to the color represented by the word that comes right before it, repeated three times.

Other words seem to correspond to different colors, with ""wif"" translating to ""red,"" ""walm"" translating to ""blue blue blue"" (suggesting repetition based on the number of letters or another property of ""walm""), and ""zup"" translating to ""yellow."" However, ""lug"" consistently means ""blue.""",1.0,92,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the outputs regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,92,lug
"dax -> ""green""

Rule:
Each unique non-dax word in the input corresponds to a unique color in the output. The presence of the nonce word ""dax"" always results in the color ""green."" Following ""dax,"" each subsequent unique word is assigned a color in a pre-determined order:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

The sequence in which the colors are assigned to words (after ""green"" for ""dax"") appears to be as follows: blue, red, green, yellow, etc. The pattern for color assignment beyond these examples would need to be identified with additional input-output pairs. However, if a word is repeated, such as ""bluf"" in the final example, it retains its assigned color (green in this case).",1.0,92,dax
"Based on the input and output pairs provided, we can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

To further analyze, let's match each instance:

- Input: ""dax lug walm"" corresponds to Output: ""green blue blue blue"". This suggests:
  - ""dax"" -> green
  - ""lug"" -> blue
  - ""walm"" -> blue blue (perhaps ""walm"" signifies a repeating pattern)
  
- Input: ""dax"" corresponds to Output: ""green"". This supports the idea that ""dax"" corresponds to green.

- Input: ""dax wif"" corresponds to Output: ""green red"". This suggests:
  - ""dax"" -> green
  - ""wif"" -> red

- Input: ""dax bluf wif zup"" corresponds to Output: ""green green red yellow"". This suggests:
  - ""dax"" -> green
  - ""bluf"" -> green
  - ""wif"" -> red
  - ""zup"" -> yellow

- Input: ""dax bluf"" corresponds to Output: ""green green"". This supports the idea that:
  - ""dax"" -> green
  - ""bluf"" -> green

With the given data, it seems clear that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of the context in which it is used. However, it's important to note that with more examples, we could further refine the meaning of ""dax"" if it changes depending on context or other factors. As of now, based on the given examples, the rule of meaning for ""dax"" is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,92,dax
"dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in every example provided.",1.0,92,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" is the first color in the output sequence. The other words in the input seem to correspond to other colors, for instance, ""wif"" coheres with ""red"", and ""zup"" with ""yellow"". ""Bluf"" could mean ""green"" as well since it outputs ""green"" in the presence of ""dax"". However, the rule provided below focuses solely on the word ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,92,dax
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green."" No matter what other words follow ""dax,"" the first output color is always green. Therefore, we can deduce that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Based on the consistent pattern where the input ""wif"" leads to the output ""red,"" and given the lack of complexity or variation in the examples, the most straightforward rule suggested by the data is:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".",1.0,92,wif
"Based on the given examples, every time the input contains the nonce word ""wif,"" the output is ""red."" This repeated association across multiple examples indicates that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

"From the provided examples, we can observe the pattern of color words following the nonce word ""zup"" and other words in the input.

- In example 1, the word ""zup"" is followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""yellow blue"" in the output.
- In example 2, ""zup"" is followed by ""lug"" again, but we also see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" from prior input-output pairs, and ""zup"" precedes it with the output ""yellow.""
- In example 3, ""zup"" is at the end of the input and followed by ""yellow"" in the output.
- In example 4, ""lug"" is both before and after ""zup"" and corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow.""
- In example 5, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" follows it with the corresponding ""yellow.""

Across all examples, it consistently appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the words it is adjacent to in the input.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,92,zup
"Based on the examples provided, zup appears to correspond to the color yellow each time it is used. The other words in the inputs consistently correspond to specific colors in the outputs, with lug mapping to blue, wif mapping to red, dax mapping to green, and bluf mapping to green as well.

From these examples, it's evident that all instances of ""bluf"" in the input correspond to ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore:

Rule: bluf -> yellow",1.0,92,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word corresponds to a specific color:

- lug -> blue

Now, let's examine the position of ""bluf"" and the corresponding output color:

1. lug wif lug dax bluf -> blue red blue green green
2. wif zup dax bluf -> red yellow green green
3. zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
4. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
5. zup bluf dax lug -> yellow yellow green blue

There appears to be a pattern where ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" if ""zup"" (which translates to yellow) is anywhere before ""bluf"" in the input. If there is another color word before ""bluf"" (e.g., ""lug"", ""wif"", ""dax""), then ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"".

However, there is no example where ""bluf"" is the first word in the input sequence, nor is there an example where ""bluf"" is immediately preceded by a word other than ""zup"" that converts to ""green"". Therefore, I can only hypothesize a rule based on the provided examples, which might be:

Rule: ""bluf"" signifies ""yellow"" if preceded by the word ""zup""; otherwise, it signifies ""green"".

2. When ""dax"" is repeated, as in ""dax zup dax,"" it still outputs ""green"" for each occurrence of ""dax.""
3. Even when ""dax"" is combined with other words such as ""wif"" or ""lug,"" it translates to ""green"" with the other words corresponding to different colors.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
",1.0,93,dax
"To deduce the rule, I'll compare the inputs with the corresponding outputs and try to derive a consistent pattern or rule that applies to all given examples.

Looking at the examples provided:

1. Input: ""dax"" -> Output: ""green""
2. Input: ""dax"" -> Output: ""green""
3. Input: ""wif dax zup dax"" -> Output: ""red green yellow green""
4. Input: ""lug dax wif"" -> Output: ""blue green red""
5. Input: ""dax walm"" -> Output: ""green green green""

Analyzing the examples, ""dax"" consistently results in ""green"" when used in isolation or in a sequence. However, the word ""dax"" is not always the word that produces ""green"", as evidenced by the fifth example where all three outputs correspond to ""green"".

From the third example, ""wif"" and ""zup"" precede and follow a ""dax"" yielding ""red"" and ""yellow,"" respectively, suggesting that the adjacent words might influence the output color.

The fourth example shows ""lug"" producing ""blue"" and ""wif"", as mentioned previously, producing ""red.""

The placement of ""dax"" in the sequence does not appear to affect its output since it is always ""green,"" whether it is at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of a sequence.

One possible interpretation might be that ""dax"" always produces ""green"" and that other words have their respective output colors, which are consistent no matter the position. However, with the limited context, it's not clear what each of the other nonce words denotes individually.

Based on the information given and the need for consistency across all examples, the rule seems to be: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,93,dax
"Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs. Each occurrence of ""dax"" in the input leads to ""green"" in the output, regardless of the presence or position of other words. The meaning does not appear to be context-dependent; it remains unchanged across different sequences.

Hence, the rule we can deduce for ""dax"" is:

dax -> green

Rule: When the word ""dax"" appears in the input, it translates to the word ""green"" in the output.",1.0,93,dax
"Analyzing the provided examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input string or the other words present.

Input: wif dax zup dax
Output: red green yellow green

In this input, ""dax"" appears twice and both times the output is ""green."" Surrounding words (""wif"" and ""zup"") produce different outputs (""red"" and ""yellow""), but the output for ""dax"" remains consistent.

Input: lug dax wif
Output: blue green red

Again, the output correlated with the word ""dax"" is ""green,"" regardless of the other words (""lug"" and ""wif"") and their respective outputs (""blue"" and ""red"").

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Here, the word ""dax"" is followed by the word ""walm,"" resulting in a triple ""green"" output. Without additional context, it's unclear whether ""walm"" also means ""green"" or if it's a modifier that repeats the output of the preceding word. However, since we are only inferring the meaning of ""dax,"" we can still confidently associate ""dax"" with the output ""green.""

Therefore, the rule deduced from the examples is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,93,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns:

- Whenever the input is a single occurrence of ""dax,"" the output is ""green."" This suggests a direct mapping from ""dax"" to ""green"" when there are no other words involved.
- However, when ""dax"" is combined with other words, the output changes.
- The word ""wif"" before ""dax"" appears to lead to the color ""red"" after ""green."" Similarly, ""wif"" at the end of an input sequence leads to ""red"" at the corresponding position in the output sequence.
- The word ""lug"" before ""dax"" gives ""blue"" before ""green.""
- ""zup"" between two ""dax"" leads to ""yellow"" between the corresponding ""green"" outputs.
- ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in a repetition of ""green"" for each occurrence of ""walm.""

From these observations, we can infer the rule:

Rule: ""dax"" correlates to the output ""green"". The presence of other words with ""dax"" seems to affect the output with a corresponding color based on the specific word (""wif"" correlates to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of ""green"").

dax -> green",0.9,93,dax

- Every occurrence of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

It changes based on the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence. Specifically, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that comes directly before it. 

Here's how the rule applies to the provided examples:

- In ""wif lug bluf,"" the word before ""bluf"" is ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" Hence, ""bluf"" means ""blue"" in this context: ""red blue blue.""
- In ""zup bluf,"" the word before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" Thus, ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" here: ""yellow yellow.""
- In ""dax zup lug zup bluf,"" the word before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" mapping to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" is ""yellow"": ""green yellow blue yellow yellow.""
- In ""dax bluf wif zup,"" the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" which maps to ""green,"" meaning ""bluf"" is ""green"": ""green green red yellow.""
- In ""wif lug bluf wif zup,"" ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and thus takes the color ""blue"": ""red blue blue red yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" in the sequence.",1.0,93,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in each input that relates to ""bluf"" and its assumed output. Comparing the inputs and outputs side by side:

- Input: wif lug bluf | Output: red blue blue
- Input: zup bluf | Output: yellow yellow
- Input: dax zup lug zup bluf | Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
- Input: dax bluf wif zup | Output: green green red yellow
- Input: wif lug bluf wif zup | Output: red blue blue red yellow

Observations:
1. Every time ""bluf"" appears, the word immediately following it (if any) has a color repeated in the output.
2. ""Bluf"" appears to take on the color value of the word immediately preceding it. Examples:
   - In ""wif lug bluf,"" the word before ""bluf"" is ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" The word following ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" which translates to ""red."" The output for ""bluf"" is ""blue,"" same as ""lug.""
   - In ""zup bluf,"" the word before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" and since there is no word after ""bluf,"" we see ""yellow"" repeated in the output, corresponding to ""zup.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color value of the word that immediately precedes it. If ""bluf"" is the last word, or there is no word following it, that color is repeated.

Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" can be deduced as follows:

bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" outputs the color of the preceding word, with that color repeated if ""bluf"" is the last word or not followed by another word.",1.0,93,bluf
"Bluf -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the last color word that appeared before it. If there is no color word before ""bluf,"" it repeats the color word following it.

Rule:
- If the word before ""bluf"" is a color word, ""bluf"" takes on that color.
- If there is no color word before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" takes on the color of the next color word. If there is no color word after ""bluf"", we don't have an example to derive the behavior from the given data.",1.0,93,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" from the given examples, we should look at the corresponding outputs to find patterns. 

1. When ""wif lug bluf"" is the input, the output is ""red blue blue."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""blue.""
2. For ""zup bluf,"" we have ""yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow.""
3. ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow blue yellow yellow."" The word ""bluf"" in this case aligns with the second ""yellow,"" just like in example 2.
4. In ""dax bluf wif zup,"" we get ""green green red yellow."" ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green"" here.
5. Finally, ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" becomes ""red blue blue red yellow."" The ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""blue,"" like in example 1.

From these examples, we can infer the following rule about ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the output.

Thus, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" could be:

bluf -> meaning: The color repeated from the previous word's color in the sequence.",0.8,93,bluf
"Analyzing the provided input and output examples, we can start deducing the meaning or the rule of the word ""walm"" by looking for patterns. Here are the outputs to focus on:

1. ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green""
2. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
3. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" -> ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue""
4. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""
5. ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green""

By examining the examples, it is clear that ""walm"" influences the output color. The word following ""walm"" does not seem to be affected by it, as the color that follows in the output does not correspond to a pattern altered by ""walm."" 

The word before ""walm"", however, does follow a pattern; the color output for the word preceding ""walm"" repeats three times before it shifts to the color corresponding to the following word if there is one. If ""walm"" is the last word in the input, the repeated color is not followed by any additional color output.

Here is a breakdown of the examples:

1. ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and before ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times. ""dax"" then corresponds to ""green"".
2. ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and before ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.
3. ""wif lug zup"" translates to ""red blue yellow."" When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times before the sequence continues.
4. ""zup walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red."" ""Walm"" follows ""zup,"" hence ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
5. ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and before ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times, followed by ""dax"" translating to ""green.""

Thus we deduce that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word before it to repeat three times.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color of the previous word to be repeated three times in the output.",1.0,93,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the given examples, let's analyze the outputs in relation to the inputs:

1. Input: wif walm dax | Output: red red red green
2. Input: lug walm | Output: blue blue blue
3. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug | Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
4. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf | Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
5. Input: lug walm dax | Output: blue blue blue green

We notice that the output colors change depending on the word that follows ""walm"": when ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" the color ""green"" is outputted; otherwise, the color following ""walm"" repeats the number of times equal to the number of words following ""walm.""

Let's establish the rule for ""walm"":

- When ""walm"" is followed by another word, that word's associated color is repeated in the output times the number of words following ""walm,"" excluding ""dax.""
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" no matter the context.

Using this rule, we can apply this logic to the inputs to check if it fits:

1. ""wif walm dax"" contains ""wif"" (red), followed by ""walm"", and then ""dax."" According to the rule, ""walm"" followed by ""dax"" simply outputs ""green,"" hence we have ""red red red green.""
   
2. ""lug walm"" ends in ""walm,"" and there are no words following it, so we simply repeat the color for ""lug"" (blue) three times.
   
3. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" contains ""walm"" with two words following, so we repeat ""wif"" (red) and ""lug"" (blue)'s colors once for each word following walm. This results in ""yellow yellow yellow red blue.""

4. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" has ""walm"" followed by three words, so ""lug"" (blue)'s color repeats three times to give ""yellow yellow yellow blue.""

5. ""lug walm dax"" follows the rule explicitly for ""walm"" followed by ""dax,"" resulting in the output, ""blue blue blue green.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output is ""green."" When ""walm"" is followed by any other word, that word's associated color is outputted as many times as there are words following ""walm,"" excluding ""dax.""",1.0,93,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it, unless it is the first word or follows ""dax,"" in which case it is ""green."" 

Let's break down the instances:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and is also red. ""dax"" changes the pattern and the next color is green.

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" follows lug and is also blue.

3. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   - The pattern holds: ""wif"" is red, ""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" is yellow. ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and is yellow, and the pattern continues as established with ""wif"" and ""lug"".

4. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   - The pattern holds again: ""zup"" is yellow, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and is yellow, ""lug"" is blue, and ""wif"" is red.

5. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and is blue, ""dax"" seems to affect the outcome, making ""walm"" turn green when it follows ""dax"".

So, based on the given examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" takes on the color of the immediately preceding word, but if it follows ""dax"" or is in the initial position, it becomes green.

Therefore:

walm -> Takes on the color of the preceding word; green if following ""dax"" or if at the beginning.",1.0,93,walm
"walm -> meaning. Meaning appears to be a rule that dictates the color following the word ""walm"" should be repeated thrice.

Rule: When ""walm"" precedes a color word, the output color word is repeated three times. For example, in the first input, ""wif walm dax,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The presence of ""walm"" between ""wif"" and ""dax"" results in ""red"" being outputted three times before ""green."" In the case where ""walm"" is the last word, as in the second input ""lug walm,"" and no color word follows it, the color corresponding to the word before ""walm,"" which is ""lug"" -> ""blue,"" is repeated thrice.",0.8,93,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the output color does not depend solely on the input word itself, but on a combination or sequence of input words. Despite that, we are tasked with ascribing meaning to the nonce word ""walm."" Let's examine the evidence:

- In all instances where ""walm"" appears, ""yellow"" is part of the output sequence.
- ""Wif walm dax"" results in ""red red red green,"" the only sequence with ""green"" at the end. Here, ""walm"" may relate to the red sequence changing to green at the end.
- ""Lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" following ""lug"" does not change the resultant color sequence.
- ""Wif lug zup walm wif lug"" results in ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" resulting in an additional ""yellow.""
- ""Zup walm lug wif bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red,"" where ""walm"" follows ""zup"" again, and the resulting sequence continues as ""yellow.""
- ""Lug walm dax"" gives ""blue blue blue green,"" showing that like the first example, ""walm"" precedes ""dax,"" changing the sequence to ""green"" at the end.

Based on these observations, the rule could be that ""walm"" affects the color sequence based on the word that immediately follows ""walm."" Specifically, when ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output color turns to green. Otherwise, ""walm"" seems to contribute to extending the sequence of the color that precedes it, usually yellow when it follows ""zup."" However, the exact effect of ""walm"" is not clear when it follows other words without ""dax"" as the immediate next word as there is no such example provided.

Since the instructions request a single meaning or rule for ""walm,"" and there is more evidence linking ""walm"" to the color ""yellow"" than to the instances when it changes a sequence to green (since the only indicator of such a change requires the presence of ""dax""), a tentative rule based on the current examples might emphasize ""walm"" being associated with ""yellow.""

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning: The presence of the word ""walm"" typically results in the color ""yellow"" in the output sequence, except if ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" in which case the output color is ""green.""",0.7,93,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" let's analyze the information given in the examples:

1. When ""lug"" is the only input, the output is ""blue.""
   Input: lug
   Output: blue

2. When ""lug"" is in combination with ""walm,"" notice that ""lug"" produces ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to produce ""blue blue blue.""
   Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue

3. The input ""lug"" repeats the output ""blue,"" confirming it from the first example.
   Input: lug
   Output: blue

4. When multiple ""lug"" and ""walm"" are in the input, each instance of ""lug"" still yields ""blue,"" whereas ""walm"" continues to yield ""blue blue blue"" except for the word ""zup"" between them, which yields ""yellow.""
   Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

5. Same as point 2, one ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" gives blue followed by three blues.
   Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

So based on the examples above, we can infer that the word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue,"" and this meaning does not seem to be context-dependent since it's consistent across all examples.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,94,lug
"lug -> blue

However, the word ""walm"" is also translated into multiple instances of ""blue"" except in the sequence ""zup lug walm,"" where it translates to ""yellow blue blue blue."" It is unclear what ""zup"" alone translates to, but it may affect the translation of the following words.

Here's the deduced rule:

lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" every time it occurs. The number or pattern of other color outputs seems related to the presence of the word ""walm"" and potentially the combination with the word ""zup,"" which may indicate a more complex rule not fully discernible with the given examples.",1.0,94,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" Each occurrence of ""lug"" in the input results in an output of ""blue.""",1.0,94,lug
"lug -> meaning.

Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""lug"" seems to be ""blue"". Every instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: ""lug"" means ""blue"".",1.0,94,lug
"Based on the examples provided, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule can be determined as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,94,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position within the sequence of words.",1.0,94,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the same position in the output. No other provided words consistently translate to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,94,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that each word corresponds to a color:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> red
- dax -> green

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: The word ""dax"" represents the color green.",1.0,94,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's examine each pair of inputs and corresponding outputs, looking for patterns associated with the word ""dax.""

1. wif zup dax -> red yellow green
2. lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> blue red green green red blue
3. zup dax -> yellow green
4. dax lug -> green blue
5. wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue

From all the examples above, each time ""dax"" occurs in the input, ""green"" appears in the same position in the output. It seems that the presence of ""dax"" directly maps to the color ""green,"" regardless of the context or the other words present in the input sequence. No other word in the input seems to correspond to ""green"" in the output. 

Thus, the rule appears to be:

"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"". Every instance of ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,94,bluf

bluf -> yellow

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds with the color ""yellow"".",1.0,94,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to first understand the relationships between the input words and the colors in the output. Here are some potential deductions based on the provided input-output pairs:

- Each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to an output of ""green.""
- Each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to an output of ""red.""
- Each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to an output of ""yellow.""

In all cases, ""bluf"" corresponds to an output of ""red"" after ""wif"" and ""yellow"" after ""zup."" When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the color is consistent — it's always ""yellow."" However, ""bluf"" does not follow ""dax"" without another word in between, so we do not have a direct correlation there.

Given these patterns, it seems that ""bluf"" may take on the color of the word before it. Hence, ""bluf"" mirrors the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> The word ""bluf"" takes the color output of the word that directly precedes it. If ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow."" When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red."" There are no examples given where ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" directly, so we cannot determine the rule for that precise sequence without additional information.",0.8,94,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" means repeating the color associated with the previous nonce word the same number of times as the previous nonce word's output length. Therefore, we notice that the color is replicated as many instances as the quantity of times the word preceding ""walm"" was translated into colors.

Here is the evidence supporting this:

- In the first instance, ""lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and since ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue"" repeated three times, matching the length of ""lug""'s output.
- In ""wif walm dax zup"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"", so ""walm"" results in ""red"" three times, and then ""dax"" and ""zup"" follow with their respective color outputs.
- For ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"", ""walm"" succeeds another ""wif"", so again the output is ""red"" repeated three times.
- The examples ""zup walm wif"" and ""zup walm"" suggest that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and thus ""walm"" yields ""yellow"" three times, matching ""zup""'s output length.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding nonce word as many times as the length of the color(s) associated with that word.",1.0,94,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the outputs of the given inputs that have ""walm"" in them:

1. lug walm -> blue blue blue
2. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
3. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> red red green green red red red blue red
4. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
5. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

We can see that no matter what other words precede ""walm"" in the input, ""walm"" results in a repetition of a color that matches the color of the word immediately before it. 

In other words, ""walm"" repeats the output value of the preceding word. 

Therefore, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm causes the color of the previous word to be repeated three times in the output.",1.0,94,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color that is outputted for the word that precedes it in a sequence three times. For example:

- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" which means walm repeats the color for ""lug"" three times.
- ""wif walm"" follows a similar pattern, with ""red red red,"" repeating the color for ""wif"" three times.
- Where ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" which outputs ""yellow,"" ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Also:

- The word following ""walm"" does not affect its output.
- ""Walm"" does not seem to have a meaning in isolation or without a preceding word; it only repeats the color of the word that comes before it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color outputted for the preceding word three times.",1.0,94,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples and look for patterns:

- Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif | Output: red red green green red red red blue red
- Input: zup walm wif | Output: yellow yellow yellow red
- Input: zup walm | Output: yellow yellow yellow

From the above examples, a direct pattern related to the word ""walm"" can be noted. It appears that the word ""walm"" causes the previous word to be repeated three times in the output.

For example:
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to consistently output a series of three identical colors. The specific color is dependent on the word that precedes ""walm."" To determine the rule for what ""walm"" means, we can analyze each input and its corresponding output:

- In the second example, ""wif walm dax zup"" yields ""red red red green yellow,"" implying that ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""wif"" to be repeated three times.
- The third example follows a similar pattern where ""wif walm"" yields ""red red red"" and is preceded by ""wif,"" reinforcing the rule that ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word that comes before it three times.
- The fourth example, ""zup walm wif,"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" where ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output is three times ""yellow,"" the color associated with ""zup.""

2. Additionally, ""dax"" does not appear to be dependent on the words around it for it to correlate with ""green.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to find a consistent pattern among the examples given.

Let's examine each case and the corresponding output:

In the first example:

We can see a regular pattern forming where ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" correlates with ""red,"" and ""wif"" also correlates with ""red."" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

In the second example:
Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf

In the third example:

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" is consistently translated into the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input strings or the context provided by the other words. 

Therefore, we can deduce the rule as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,95,dax
"The rule seems to be based on the association of each nonce word with a particular color. ""Dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in every example. The other nonce words correspond to other colors. For instance, ""wif"" always leads to red, ""bluf"" to red as well (but blue when it follows ""lug""), and ""zup"" to yellow. Therefore, based on the patterns observed in the examples, the rule can be interpreted as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,95,dax
"Rule: ""wif"" in these examples functions as an instruction to repeat the color associated with the following word an additional number of times equal to the number of times that color has already appeared in the output sequence.

For example:

1. ""dax walm wif walm"" 
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" then signals to repeat the color associated with ""walm"" (""green"") as many times as it has already appeared (2 times) 
   Output: green green green red red red

2. ""zup wif lug""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" then signals to repeat the color associated with ""lug"" (""blue"") as many times as it has appeared in the sequence before ""wif"" (0 times, thus adding once)
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   Output: yellow red blue

   And so on for the other examples.

Therefore, ""wif"" appears to insert repetitions of the following word's associated color into the output, determined by the number of times that color has already been mentioned.

So the rule is defined as:

wif -> Repeat the color associated with the following word, adding repetitions equal to the number of times that color has appeared before the ""wif"" word in the output sequence.",1.0,95,wif
"wif -> Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""",1.0,95,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,95,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" acts as an instruction to reverse the order of the colors associated with the words that follow it. Here's how:

- In the first input, ""dax walm wif walm"" translates to ""green green green red red red."" The color associated with ""walm"" must be 'green', and since 'walm' is mentioned twice after ""wif,"" 'green' is represented three times in reverse order.

- In the second example, ""zup wif lug"" yields ""yellow red blue."" We can infer that 'lug' corresponds to 'blue' because it is the last color in the output. Since ""wif"" is followed by only ""lug,"" 'blue' is directly followed by 'red,' which must be the color for ""wif"".

- In the third input, ""wif lug"" gives ""red blue."" As established before, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue.' With ""wif"" preceding it, 'blue' follows 'red,' reinforcing that ""wif"" corresponds to 'red'.

- The fourth example, ""lug zup wif lug,"" translates to ""blue yellow red blue."" This time, 'lug' appears before and after ""wif."" The order of 'blue' after ""wif"" is preserved, followed by 'red,' the color of ""wif,"" and then 'blue' again.

- The fifth input, ""wif lug dax lug,"" results in ""red blue green blue."" This follows the established pattern: 'lug' corresponds to 'blue,' 'dax' to 'green,' and after ""wif,"" the colors are reversed from their order of appearance.

Given this information, it seems that ""wif"" signals a reversal in the order of color outputs for the words that appear after it. Additionally, ""wif"" itself corresponds to the color 'red.'

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" is:

wif -> ""wif"" corresponds to the color red and reverses the color output order of the words that follow it.

Rule: When ""wif"" appears in an input, it assigns the color red and causes the sequence of colors represented by the subsequent words to be reversed in the output.",0.8,95,wif
"To figure out what ""wif"" means, let's compare the inputs and outputs systematically:

1. ""dax walm wif walm"" -> ""green green green red red red""
   Here, ""wif"" seems to precede the transition from ""green"" to ""red.""

2. ""zup wif lug"" -> ""yellow red blue""
   ""Wif"" is between ""zup"" and ""lug,"" causing the output to transition from ""yellow"" to ""red,"" followed by ""lug"" being ""blue.""

3. ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
   ""Wif"" comes before ""lug,"" leading to the sequence ""red"" before ""lug"" which is ""blue.""

4. ""lug zup wif lug"" -> ""blue yellow red blue""
   ""Wif"" again appears before ""lug,"" and the ""lug"" after ""wif"" is the same color ""blue"" as the first ""lug.""

5. ""wif lug dax lug"" -> ""red blue green blue""
   Here, ""wif"" precedes ""lug"" and is followed by ""red,"" whereas the rest of the sequence follows the earlier pattern for ""lug"" and ""dax.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule for ""wif"":

- ""Wif"" causes a shift in color in the sequence, producing ""red"" when it comes before a word representing a color.

Rule: Wif -> causes the output color to be ""red"" when it precedes another word.",0.8,95,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""zup wif walm lug"", the output is ""yellow red red red blue"", with ""zup"" aligning with ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"", the output is ""red red yellow red blue green"", with ""zup"" again aligning with ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""wif zup"", the output is ""red yellow"", where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm wif"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow red"", where ""zup"" is the first word and aligns with the first color ""yellow"".
- In the fifth example, ""dax zup"", the output is ""green yellow"", with ""zup"" matching ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,95,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer a consistent pattern for the nonce word ""zup"" and its corresponding output. Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. Therefore, we can deduce a rule for the meaning of ""zup.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,95,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:
zup -> yellow",1.0,95,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Each example where ""zup"" is used in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output, following the same position as ""zup"" in the input sequence.",1.0,95,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,95,zup
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.,1.0,95,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look for the patterns in which it appears and compare it against the output to see if there is a consistent rule or representation.

In every example, ""bluf"" outputs as ""red red"". The number of reds does not change with the preceding word, as ""bluf"" always translates to two instances of red regardless of the word that comes before it.

Now let's write the rule:

Rule: bluf -> red red (two consecutive instances of the color red)",1.0,95,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the correspondence between the inputs and outputs.

From example 1:
Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
Output: yellow green yellow green red red

""zup"" is paired with ""yellow,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""wif"" with ""red."" When ""bluf"" is added after ""wif,"" we get an additional ""red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" might mean repetition or doubling of the previous color.

From example 2:
Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red

Here ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and again after ""bluf"" we see a repetition of ""red,"" supporting the doubling rule.

From example 3:
Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

Every color except the one following ""bluf"" has a one-to-one correspondence with a word. ""Bluf"" is after ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" and ""red"" is repeated, further giving credence to the repetition rule.

From example 4:
Input: lug dax bluf
Output: blue green green

""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""bluf"" causes ""green"" to repeat, which aligns with previous observations.

From example 5:
Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif
Output: red red yellow yellow red

Here, we see ""wif"" as ""red,"" followed by ""red"" again after ""bluf."" Then ""zup"" as ""yellow,"" followed by ""yellow"" again after ""bluf."" The pattern holds.

Rule: 
bluf -> causes the previous color word to double or repeat.",1.0,95,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the contexts in which it appears and the associated colors in the output. Let's break it down based on each example:

1. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red
   ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red red"".

2. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   Again, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red red"".

3. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   Once more, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red red"".

4. Input: lug dax bluf
   Output: blue green green
   ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in ""green"".

5. Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: red red yellow yellow red
   Both occurrences of ""bluf"" follow different words (""wif"" and ""zup"") and result in ""red red"" after ""wif"" and ""yellow"" after ""zup"".

From these examples, it looks like ""bluf"" may not have a fixed meaning in isolation but may modify or depend on the word prior to it, repeating the color associated with that word in the output. To summarize:

- If ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" it results in ""red red"".
- If ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" it results in ""green"".
- If ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" it would repeat the output associated with ""zup"", which is ""yellow"".
- If ""bluf"" were to follow ""lug"", it is unclear from the examples provided what the direct result would be.

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color of the word it follows. If the word before ""bluf"" results in ""color"", then ""bluf"" results in ""color color""; if the word before ""bluf"" does not duplicate color in its translation, then ""bluf"" translates to a single instance of the color. The only exception found in the examples is when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which turns to ""green"" regardless of the normal duplication rule when ""bluf"" is involved.",0.8,95,bluf
"Analyzing the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" correlates with a specific color output or pattern in each example. We can try to detect patterns by comparing the input with the corresponding output:

1. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red
   The word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red red"" in the output.

2. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red red"".

3. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   Once more, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red red"".

4. Input: lug dax bluf
   Output: blue green green
   Here ""bluf"" only corresponds to ""green"" which differs from previous examples.

5. Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: red red yellow yellow red
   ""Bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when it precedes ""zup"" and ""red"" when it follows ""wif"".

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be associated with the color ""red"" in some way, often resulting in an output of two reds. However, in the fourth example, the output is ""green"" after ""bluf"", which deviates from the established pattern. Given that this is the only example where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" rather than ""red"", it could be an exception or an error in the pattern.

Due to inconsistencies, it's difficult to establish a definitive rule with just these examples. If we discount example 4 as an anomaly or error, we could propose the following rule based on the remaining consistent examples:

Rule:
bluf -> means ""red"" repeated in the output, corresponding to two instances of ""red"". However, given the inconsistency presented in example 4, further examples would be needed to confirm this rule or to refine it to account for the discrepancy.",0.8,95,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be that when ""walm"" follows another word, the output replaces ""walm"" with three repetitions of the color coded for the word that precedes it. For example:

- ""lug walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""dax walm"" becomes ""green green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Meaning can be word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:

The word ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,95,walm
"walm -> triple the color associated with the previous word. Rule: When 'walm' follows a color-indicating word (lug for blue, zup for yellow, dax for green), the output is the color associated with that word, repeated three times.",1.0,95,walm

"walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is encountered, the output is the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" repeated three times.",1.0,95,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at the word that precedes ""walm"" in each input and the corresponding output that follows it. 

In the given examples:

1. ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue."" The word ""lug"" on its own is not available in the examples, but ""lug"" seems to trigger the word ""blue."" Since ""walm"" follows it, it seems to triple the word produced by ""lug.""

2. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green."" Here, we can observe that ""zup"" produces ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" produces ""green."" Similarly, ""wif"" produces ""red."" The sequence ""lug zup"" leads to ""blue yellow."" Considering the pattern in example 1, after ""zup walm"" we get ""yellow yellow yellow"" like a triplication of the word ""zup"" produces. This aligns with the first example with ""lug walm.""

3. ""lug walm zup walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow."" This further strengthens the pattern; ""lug walm"" gives us ""blue blue blue,"" and ""zup walm"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow.""

4. ""dax walm"" gives us ""green green green."" This follows the same pattern, as ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and with ""walm,"" it gets triplicated.

5. ""zup wif walm lug"" produces ""yellow red red red blue."" ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" ""Wif walm"" should be looked at together. ""Wif"" is ""red,"" but when followed by ""walm,"" it is ""red red red,"" triplicating the output of ""wif."" ""Lug"" at the end gives a single instance of ""blue.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" is a modifier that causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to be repeated three times. 

Rule: ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to be triplicated in the output.",1.0,95,walm
"Based on the examples provided, each instance where the word ""lug"" appears, the output is consistently ""blue.""

"Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",1.0,96,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.

The word ""bluf"" causes the color of the previous word to be repeated. If the previous word is ""dax"" which has been associated with the color green, the output for ""bluf"" is ""green"". If the previous word is ""wif"" which corresponds to red, ""bluf"" leads to the output ""red"", and so on for each example provided.",1.0,96,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for a consistent pattern in the given examples. Let's start by comparing the inputs and their respective outputs.

1. Input: dax bluf          -> Output: green green
2. Input: wif bluf          -> Output: red red
3. Input: lug bluf zup      -> Output: blue blue yellow
4. Input: dax lug bluf dax  -> Output: green blue blue green
5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm -> Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

From the examples, we can observe the following:
- When a word appears before ""bluf,"" the output repeats the color associated with that word twice.
- When ""bluf"" appears between words, it repeats the color of the word that follows it.
- In example five, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output is ""yellow blue blue blue."" Since ""lug"" is associated with the color blue and there are two ""blue"" after ""yellow,"" it seems that ""bluf"" immediate repeats the pattern of colors that follow it as long as the next word doesn't change the pattern.

Based on the inputs and outputs given, we can induce the following rule: ""bluf"" in the input results in a doubling of the color associated with the word that immediately follows it in the output.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is:
bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the following word twice. If the following word initiates a new color pattern, repeat that pattern until a different word changes it.",0.8,96,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" from the examples provided, we need to look for patterns in the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: ""dax bluf"" -> Output: ""green green""
2. Input: ""wif bluf"" -> Output: ""red red""
3. Input: ""lug bluf zup"" -> Output: ""blue blue yellow""
4. Input: ""dax lug bluf dax"" -> Output: ""green blue blue green""
5. Input: ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" -> Output: ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue""

We need to observe what happens immediately after the word ""bluf"" in each input to see if there's a relationship with the outputs:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" which results in ""green green,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" could mean ""repeat previous color.""
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" is also the last word and doubles the color of ""wif,"" supporting the repeating pattern.
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" precedes ""zup"" which isn't immediately repeated in the output. Instead, the color ""blue"" from before ""bluf"" is repeated. Again, this supports ""repeat previous color.""
4. In the fourth example, the pattern holds as ""bluf"" repeats the preceding ""lug"" color, resulting in ""blue blue.""
5. In the fifth example, after ""bluf,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated twice before changing to ""walm,"" which is not represented by a new color but instead repeats ""blue"" again, indicating a multiple repetition rule.

In summary, the rule seems to suggest that ""bluf"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. If the preceding noun appears multiple times in a sequence, the associated color is repeated an equal number of times as the occurrences of the noun.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding noun the number of times it appears in the input.",0.8,96,bluf
Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word.,0.0,96,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the next word to be repeated in the output with the color that corresponds to the initial word before ""walm"". Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""lug walm zup"" leads to ""blue blue blue"". Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and then ""walm"" causes ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow"") to output ""blue"" instead.
  
- In the second example, ""dax walm zup"" has ""green green green"" for ""dax walm"" and then ""yellow"" for ""zup"". ""Walm"" again causes the corresponding color for ""dax"" (green) to be repeated.

- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the next color is ""blue"", corresponding to ""lug"", instead of the color that would correspond to ""wif"".

- In the fourth example, there is no word after ""walm"", but since ""dax"" is green, the output is simply ""green green green"".

- Finally, in the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif"", causing ""wif"" to correspond to ""green"", the color of ""dax"". This pattern repeats with the second instance of ""walm"" causing ""zup"" to also output ""red"", following the rule previously established.

Therefore, ""walm"" makes the next word take on the color of the word that appears immediately before ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> causes the next word's color output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"".",1.0,96,walm
"Rule: ""walm"" translates to ""repeat the previous color"". 

In each of the Output sequences, whenever the term ""walm"" appears, it is followed by a repetition of the color that was used just before it.

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue"", and then later ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and is immediately followed by ""walm"" which again results in ""red"". 

- In the second example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green"" and later ""walm"" after ""lug"" translates to ""yellow blue green"".

- In the third example, the sequence ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue"" and happens again following the same pattern.

- In the fourth example, it is just ""dax walm"", which translates to ""green green"".

- In the last example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green"" and later ""wif walm zup"" translates to ""red red yellow"".

So, walm -> repeat the previous color.",1.0,96,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to result in a repetition of the previously mentioned color. The number of repetitions aligns with the number of times ""walm"" appears consecutively. Here is the specific rule I've deduced:

- When ""walm"" follows a color-indicating word, it causes the color word that immediately precedes it to repeat.

Example analysis:

1. lug walm zup lug zup wif
   blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

""Lug"" is first, resulting in blue. ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" and repeats ""blue"" twice.

2. dax walm zup lug
   green green green yellow blue

""Dax"" is green, followed by ""walm"" which repeats ""green"" two more times.

3. zup lug walm wif dax
   yellow blue blue blue red green

Here, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", so ""blue"" is repeated twice.

4. dax walm
   green green green

""Dax"" is green, and ""walm"" follows, so ""green"" is repeated two more times.

5. dax walm wif walm zup
   green green green red red red yellow

""Dax"" is green, and ""walm"" follows it, repeating ""green"". Then ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and repeats ""red"".

Rule:
walm -> causes the color word immediately before it to repeat, with the number of repetitions matching the number of consecutive ""walm"" instances.",1.0,96,walm
"Examining the provided examples, it's possible to deduce a rule for the meaning of ""walm"":

In all instances where the word ""walm"" appears, the corresponding output is a repetition of the color that follows the term ""walm"" in the input sequence. By analyzing each example, we can see that ""walm"" causes the next color word to be output three times instead of once.

For example:

Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

Here ""walm"" precedes ""zup,"" which outputs to ""blue."" Instead of outputting ""blue"" once, it is repeated three times: ""blue blue blue.""

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow

In this case, ""walm"" first precedes ""wif,"" which outputs as ""red,"" thus it is ""red red red."" Later in the sequence, ""walm"" precedes ""zup,"" which results in ""yellow,"" repeated three times as ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the nonce word 'walm' maps to the color corresponding to the word before it. Let's verify this rule:

- In example 1, 'lug walm' translates to 'blue blue', so 'walm' takes the color of 'lug', which is blue.
- In example 2, 'dax walm' translates to 'green green green', 'walm' takes the color of 'dax', which is green.
- In example 3, 'lug walm' translates to 'blue blue', again taking the color of 'lug'.
- In example 4, 'dax walm' translates to 'green green green', here also 'walm' takes the color of 'dax'.
- Lastly, in example 5, 'dax walm' translates to 'green green green' and 'walm wif' translates to 'red red', with 'walm' taking the color of the preceding words respectively ('dax' is green and 'wif' is red).

5. The single word ""dax"" on its own results in a single color ""green.""

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a repeated color word. The repetition is based on the color word that precedes ""walm."" Let's examine the examples and determine the rule.

In the first and second examples:
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green""
In both cases, the color word ""green"" is repeated three times, which implies that ""dax"" might mean ""green"" and ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the previous color word twice more.

In the third example:
- ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif""
This translates to ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red."" Here, ""lug"" which might mean ""blue"" is followed by ""walm,"" leading to two more repetitions of ""blue.""

In the fourth example:
- ""zup bluf lug zup walm""

In the fifth example:
- ""zup walm wif""
This turns into ""yellow yellow yellow red."" As with the previous examples, ""zup"" followed by ""walm"" results in two more ""yellow"" words.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the previous color name to be repeated two additional times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color word two more times.",1.0,97,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the last color mentioned before walm. 

Examples:

1. dax walm -> green green green (because 'dax' translates to 'green' and 'walm' means to repeat the last mentioned color)

- In the third example, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" Following each, ""walm"" causes the last color to be repeated.

- In the fourth example, again ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and after ""zup walm,"" we see ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" prompts a repetition of ""yellow.""

- In the fifth example, likewise, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output repeats the color ""yellow.""

"Analyzing the provided examples to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"":

1. Input: dax walm

2. Input: dax walm

   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

4. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red

From the provided examples, the first repeating pattern that can be observed is that every single instance of ""walm"" in the input corresponds to a sequence of three color words in the output. The second observation is that the sequence of colors for ""walm"" seems to depend on the word that precedes ""walm.""

Let's look at each instance with more detail.
- When ""dax walm"" occurs, the output is ""green green green."" Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and it is followed by ""walm,"" we see a repeat of the color ""green"" three times.
- In the third and fourth examples, we see that ""walm"" follows different words (""lug"" and ""zup"") and correspondingly, the output colors are repeated sequences but not always of the same color as the one that precedes ""walm.""
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" hence ""walm"" repeats the output color of ""lug.""
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" hence ""walm"" repeats the output color of ""zup.""

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it repeats the color word that corresponds to the word immediately before ""walm"" in a sequence of three.

2. Every occurrence of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
3. Every occurrence of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
4. Every occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Observing the pattern of outputs in relation to the inputs:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" ""lug,"" or ""zup,"" the output is a repetition of the previous color three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" there is no repetition, indicating that ""walm"" might not interact with ""wif"" in the same way or the pattern doesn't apply after ""wif.""
- The number of times ""walm"" occurs consecutively, the color repeats that many times.

With these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color word that precedes it, with the exception of when preceded by ""wif,"" where no repetition occurs.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" in output. However, there is one exception in the third example, where ""bluf"" appears between ""zup"" and ""lug,"" and translates to ""yellow,"" while ""lug"" by itself translates to ""blue."" Here are the observed correlations:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Noticing the exception and analyzing the sequences, the ""bluf"" seems to take on the color of the preceding word (except when following ""dax,"" which makes ""bluf"" red). This might suggest a rule that ""bluf"" assumes the color of the previous word, except when ""dax"" is the preceding word, in which case it turns red instead of green. However, given that we have limited data and there seems to be a direct contradiction in the examples (the third example where ""bluf"" still translates to ""yellow"" even though it follows ""zup""), the exact rule for ""bluf"" is difficult to determine with the given examples and seems inconsistent.

Given the above, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"" or when it is the only word translated. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it becomes ""red."" When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it is ""blue.""

1. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue

3. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green
4. dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue
5. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue

We can see a pattern where the word ""bluf"" is consistently translated to the color ""yellow."" However, an examination of the surrounding outputs indicates that ""bluf"" does not always output yellow:

- In the first example, the output associated with ""bluf"" is a sequence of ""yellow blue.""
- In the third example, the output for ""bluf"" is again a single ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, the output for ""bluf"" is ""red blue.""

Given this inconsistency in the outputs when ""bluf"" is used, ""bluf"" likely involves a rule that goes beyond simply translating to one color. Let's expand the analysis and consider the surrounding words and outputs:

- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" ""bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" as seen in the first and last examples, the output sequence for ""bluf lug"" is ""yellow blue.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" we see an output of ""red blue"" (example 4), but an extra blue at the end (example 1).

This variation in output surrounding ""bluf"" could indicate that the meaning of ""bluf"" is influenced by the context, or that ""bluf"" refers to a rule or modifies the output of the words around it. Due to inconsistencies and dependencies on other words, a definitive meaning for ""bluf"" cannot be pinpointed based on the given dataset. We may need a more extensive set of examples or additional rules to clarify the consistent role of ""bluf.""

Rule:
The rule for ""bluf"" isn't clearly defined due to inconsistent outputs in the given examples.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the pattern of colors that correspond to the use of ""walm"" in the input and their context among other words.

Analyzing the examples given:

- When ""lug walm wif"" is inputted, the output is ""blue blue blue red."" Since ""lug"" itself results in ""blue,"" it seems that ""walm"" causes the previous word's color to repeat and ""wif"" results in ""red.""
- Similarly, ""zup walm wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" suggesting that ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and again ""walm"" causes this color to repeat, followed by ""red"" for ""wif.""
- For ""dax walm,"" which outputs ""green green green,"" it's clear that ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and once more, ""walm"" causes the repetition of that color.
- Looking at ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" the output is ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" produces ""red"" as well. It's consistent that ""walm"" makes the color before it repeat without changing the rest of the sequence.
- Finally, ""zup dax walm"" outputs ""yellow green green green,"" which further confirms that ""walm"" repeats the preceding word's associated color.

Rule:

- In ""zup walm wif,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so after ""walm,"" yellow is repeated three times before the sequence continues.
- In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, so after ""walm,"" green is repeated three times.
- In ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" the ""zup"" before ""walm"" corresponds to yellow, which is then repeated three times before the sequence continues with the color for ""dax"" (green), and so on.

Therefore: walm -> causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times.",1.0,98,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be a rule that replicates the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. When ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" it appears to add the color red at the end.

- ""lug walm wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue red,"" signifying that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and ""wif,"" when placed after ""walm,"" always results in red being added.
- ""zup walm wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" signifying that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and again, ""wif"" following ""walm"" results in red being appended.
- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green,"" indicating that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and without ""wif"" following ""walm,"" no red is added.
- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red,"" which further confirms the repetition rule and shows that when ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" red is added, and ""bluf"" corresponds to red.
- ""zup dax walm"" outputs ""yellow green green green,"" confirming that ""walm"" replicates the color of the word before it three times.

- Additionally, ""wif"" precedes ""dax,"" and this combination corresponds to ""red green,"" while on its own, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" again supporting the idea that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Given the consistent presence of ""red"" whenever ""wif"" appears, it's reasonable to conclude that ""wif"" means ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,99,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" let's look at the patterns involving the word in relation to the colors listed in the outputs.

Considering the first example:
- ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue red green green red""
  Here, we notice:
  - ""lug"" before ""wif"" corresponds to ""blue red""
  - ""dax"" after ""wif"" corresponds to ""green green""
  - ""wif"" isn't directly followed by any specific color since both occurrences are followed by different words (""dax"" and ""bluf"") and therefore different colors.

In the second example:
- ""lug wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow""
  Here, ""lug"" precedes ""wif"" and results in ""blue red,"" consistent with the first example, and ""dax"" after ""wif"" results in ""green,"" which is the only color after ""wif.""

In the third example:
- ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue""
  This corresponds with ""wif"" before ""lug,"" giving us ""red blue,"" which also holds true for other examples where ""lug"" follows ""wif.""

In the fourth example:
- ""lug wif dax walm zup"" translates to ""blue red green green green yellow""
  The only uncertain part is ""wif dax walm,"" but considering prior examples, ""wif"" before ""dax"" gives us ""red green,"" and since ""walm"" consistently results in yellow, it doesn't interfere with the pattern derived for ""wif.""

In the fifth example:
- ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green""
  Which is consistent with the ""wif"" and ""dax"" relationship in previous examples.

From these observations, we can deduce a consistent meaning:
- The word ""wif"" appears to mean ""red."" This can be concluded based on the consistent appearance of ""red"" following ""wif,"" regardless of the word that precedes or follows it.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,99,wif
"Given the input and output examples provided, it seems that 'wif' is serving as a connector that results in a color change in the output:

1. In the first example, the presence of 'wif' turns 'lug' into blue and 'dax' into green.
2. In the second example, 'lug wif dax' translates to 'blue red green,' and when 'wif' is not present, as with 'zup walm,' the output color does not change from yellow.
3. In the third example, the solitary use of 'wif' before 'lug' results in 'red,' suggesting that 'wif' changes the color associated with the following word.
4. In the fourth example, when 'wif' is used between 'lug' and 'dax,' those words turn into 'blue' and 'green,' respectively. Without 'wif' as in 'walm zup,' the color remains unchanged as green and then yellow.
5. In the fifth example, 'wif dax' results in 'red green,' indicating again that 'wif' affected the color outcome of the word after it.

Based on this analysis, the rule for 'wif' appears to be this:

Rule: When 'wif' precedes a word, it changes the default color associated with the word following it. Without 'wif,' the words 'lug,' 'dax,' etc., would have a default color that does not appear in these examples. 'Wif' serves as an operator to modify this.

Therefore:
wif -> rule that changes the color associated with the following word.",0.8,99,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" indicates a color switch or indicates that the following word shall change to a color. Each example alternates colors in an identifiable pattern whenever ""wif"" is used:

1. ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, ""dax"" to green, and ""bluf"" to red.
2. When the word ""wif"" appears, the next color switches from its current sequence (for example, after ""lug wif,"" ""dax"" turns to red instead of green).
3. This rule seems consistent across the examples. The color sequence without ""wif"" present could be inferred as: lug -> blue, zup -> yellow, dax -> green, walm -> yellow, bluf -> red.
4. ""wif"" acts as an instruction to change the next color in a specific way: ""lug wif"" results in ""dax"" changing from green to red, and similarly, ""dax wif"" would presumably switch the following color as well.

From the given data, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" takes the next color word and changes it to the color that would be assigned to the word ""bluf"" (which is red) within the sequence if no other context is provided. In sequences where ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" ""lug"" turns to blue, but this may be just because ""lug"" is defined as blue in the given examples. Therefore, context-dependent, ""wif"" could cause a change to other colors too, but no patterns regarding that can be deduced from the given examples.

wif -> Changes the next color word in the sequence to red. (Based on available context)",0.8,99,wif

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".",1.0,99,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color output of the word right before it. 

For example:
- In ""lug bluf"", ""lug"" outputs ""blue"" and ""bluf"" repeats that color as ""blue blue.""
- In ""zup dax bluf"", ""dax"" outputs ""green"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color as ""green green.""
- In all other examples, ""bluf"" directly follows a color word and repeats its output.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

bluf -> Repeats the color of the preceding word. Rule: If a color word is immediately followed by ""bluf,"" the output of ""bluf"" will be the same color as the word before it.",1.0,99,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" takes the color value of the word that immediately precedes it. The color associations are as follows:

- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red

For instance, in the first example when ""lug"" (which means blue) precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue."" In the second example, ""dax"" (which means green) precedes ""bluf,"" and the output is ""green green."" This pattern follows in all other examples as well.

Therefore, the rule appears to be: 

bluf -> takes the color of the word that comes before it.",1.0,99,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns in the input and output strings.

The first input/output pair ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"" suggests that ""bluf"" may mean ""blue,"" since ""lug"" also translates to ""blue.""

However, the remaining pairs illustrate that whenever ""bluf"" is used, the next word's color is repeated. 

- In ""zup dax bluf,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" results in the repetition of ""green.""
- In ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" precedes the repetition of ""red,"" followed by ""dax"" translating to ""green"" again.
- In ""dax bluf wif lug,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""bluf"" leads to the repetition of ""green,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
- In ""wif bluf dax lug,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""bluf"" results in ""red"" being repeated, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Based on these observations, ""bluf"" appears to signal the repetition of the next color in the series.

Rule: bluf -> Causes the next color word to be repeated in the output.",1.0,99,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" changes depending on the word that is immediately preceding it, and it transforms into the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it in the series of inputs. For instance, if the word before ""bluf"" is ""lug,"" the output is ""blue"" (as seen in the first example). Accordingly, based on the examples provided above:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", ""bluf"" translates to ""green"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", ""bluf"" translates to ""red"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"".

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that directly precedes it.",1.0,99,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we observe the following patterns:

1. When 'bluf' is preceded by 'lug', the output is 'blue blue'.
2. When 'bluf' is preceded by 'dax', the output is 'green green'.
3. When 'bluf' is preceded by 'wif', the output is 'red red'.
4. When 'bluf' is preceded by 'zup', the output is 'yellow green'. However, we don't have an example where 'bluf' directly follows 'zup', so it may be that the 'green' is not directly related to 'bluf' in this case.

From these observations, it appears that 'bluf' takes the color of the preceding word and repeats it twice in the output. The rule seems to be that 'bluf' duplicates the color associated with the word right before it.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the word preceding it, resulting in that color being output twice.",0.75,99,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with a repeated output of a color that corresponds to the word preceding it. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""wif lug walm"": ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, ""lug"" to blue. The word ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output is blue repeated thrice.
2. ""lug wif walm"": Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""wif"" to red. ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" and causes the output to be red repeated thrice.
3. ""wif walm"": The color associated with ""wif"" is red, and is repeated thrice after ""walm"".
4. ""dax walm wif dax"": The color for ""dax"" is green; ""walm"" follows ""dax"" leading to green repeated three times. ""Wif"" corresponds to red, and is succeeded by ""dax"" again leading to green.
5. ""zup walm"": The color for ""zup"" is yellow, followed by ""walm,"" which results in yellow repeated thrice.

3. ""wif walm"" gives ""red red red,"" which continues the pattern where ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color ""red.""

4. ""dax walm wif dax"" leads to ""green green green red green."" We can deduce ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" ""Walm"" after ""dax"" results in three greens, repeating the color associated with ""dax.""

- However, ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" which demonstrates that when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it means ""yellow"" instead of ""blue.""

- In ""wif bluf dax,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red red green,"" not providing additional information about ""bluf"" other than it's not affected by ""wif"" before it.

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to examine the patterns in the input and their corresponding colors in the output. Let's look at the presence of bluf and the colors that follow it in each example:

1. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
2. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
3. wif bluf dax -> red red green
4. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red
5. wif bluf -> red red

Notice that in each case, the color that appears after ""bluf"" in the output is a repeat of the color that was assigned to the word just before ""bluf"" in the input. Here's the breakdown:

1. dax (green) zup (yellow) bluf -> green yellow yellow
2. dax (green) bluf zup (yellow) -> green green yellow
3. wif (red) bluf dax (green) -> red red green
4. lug (blue) bluf wif (red) -> blue blue red
5. wif (red) bluf -> red red

Based on the examples given, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" causes the repeat or duplication of the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> The word ""bluf"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word in the output sequence.",1.0,101,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the outputs associated with its position in the input relative to the other words:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (dax bluf), the output is green (for ""dax"") and green (for ""bluf"").
2. When ""bluf"" precedes ""dax"" (bluf dax), the output is red (for ""bluf"") and green (for ""dax"").
3. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (wif bluf), the output is red (for ""wif"") and red (for ""bluf"").
4. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (lug bluf), the output is blue (for ""lug"") and blue (for ""bluf"").
5. When used as a two-word input with ""wif"" (wif bluf), the output is red (for ""wif"") and red (for ""bluf"").

From this analysis, the rule seems clear: ""bluf"" takes the color of the word it directly follows. If ""bluf"" precedes a word, the associated color does not repeat, indicating that the color associated with ""bluf"" in this case is unique to its position and not dependent on the preceding word.

Putting this information together, I can deduce:

bluf -> meaning Rule: If ""bluf"" directly follows another word, the output color for ""bluf"" will be the same as the output color for the preceding word. If ""bluf"" precedes another word, the output color for ""bluf"" will be red.",0.9,101,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look at the patterns and commonalities in the provided examples. Here are the provided examples mapped out:

- dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
- dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
- wif bluf dax -> red red green
- lug bluf wif -> blue blue red
- wif bluf -> red red

Looking at these examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" affects the color output in the following way:

- The output color is green when ""bluf"" follows ""dax.""
- The output color is red when ""bluf"" follows ""wif.""
- The output color is blue when ""bluf"" follows ""lug.""
- When ""dax"" follows ""bluf,"" the output color preceding it is green again.
- When ""zup"" is involved, either following ""dax"" or ""bluf,"" the resulting color is yellow.
- Without a preceding word, as in the last case ""wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" produces red again.

Based on this analysis, it seems that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it:

- ""dax"" associates with green, so ""bluf"" after ""dax"" is green.
- ""wif"" associates with red, so ""bluf"" after ""wif"" is red.
- ""lug"" associates with blue, so ""bluf"" after ""lug"" is blue.

From this, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""dax"" the color is green, if the preceding word is ""wif"" the color is red, and if the preceding word is ""lug"" the color is blue.",0.8,101,bluf
"To determine the rule for the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns and the associated colors in the outputs:

1. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" or ""lug,"" the color associated with ""bluf"" matches the color associated with the previous word:
    - ""dax zup bluf"" yields green yellow yellow.
    - ""dax bluf zup"" yields green green yellow.
    - ""lug bluf wif"" yields blue blue red.

2. When ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" or is the last word, the color associated with ""bluf"" matches the color that is associated with ""dax"" elsewhere:
    - ""wif bluf dax"" yields red red green (notice that green is associated with ""dax"").
    - ""wif bluf"" yields red red.

3. The position of ""bluf"" does not affect the color associated with it, only the word that is next to it:
    - ""dax bluf zup"" vs ""dax zup bluf"" still yields green for ""bluf"" when near ""dax"".
    - ""lug bluf wif"" yields blue for ""bluf"" next to ""lug"".

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it or the color associated with ""dax"" when it follows ""wif"" or is at the end.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word or the color associated with ""dax"" if it is after ""wif"" or at the end.",0.8,101,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"", we should look at the correspondences between the inputs and the outputs in the given examples. Here's a summary of the input-output relations:

1. ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""
2. ""dax bluf zup"" -> ""green green yellow""
3. ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green""
4. ""lug bluf wif"" -> ""blue blue red""
5. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""

Looking at these examples, we can infer that ""bluf"" changes its output based on the word that appears before it. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green."" When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red."" When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue."" 

Another thing to note is that when ""bluf"" is the last word in the input, it seems to repeat the color of the word that came immediately before it. ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green,"" ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue,"" and ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red.""

Based on this, the rule seems to be:
- ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

Thus, we can write the rule for ""bluf"" as follows:

bluf -> Takes on the color of the preceding word. Rule: Repeat the color associated with the word that comes just before ""bluf"" in the input.",0.8,101,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we analyze how the input corresponds to the output in each given example. Observing a pattern, we can start making a hypothesis of what rule ""walm"" follows:

1. In every example, the presence of ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of the color that follows the pattern of the word preceding ""walm."" 
2. When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated.
3. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""green"" is repeated.

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to repeat in sequence until a new word appears.

Therefore, walm -> causes the previous color to be repeated.",1.0,101,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the input and output pairings from the examples provided:

1. Whenever ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" a string of ""yellow"" appears in the output, equivalent to the number of times ""zup"" occurs before ""walm."" After ""walm,"" the pattern changes to the color code associated with the next word (e.g. ""dax"" -> green, ""wif"" -> red, ""lug"" -> blue).

2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is similar to when it follows ""zup,"" with a string of ""green"" appearing in the output according to the number of times ""dax"" appears before ""walm."" After ""walm,"" the pattern switches to the color code of the next word.

3. When ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, such as in ""dax lug walm,"" the last color code before ""walm"" (in this case ""blue"") is repeated as many times as ""lug"" appears after ""dax.""

From these observations, we can conclude that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. The number of repetitions corresponds to the number of times that word appears before ""walm."" After ""walm,"" the color pattern is determined by the following word(s) as per their own associated color.

Rule: walm -> Indicates a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, as many times as that word appears before ""walm.""",1.0,101,walm
"Based on the examples provided with consistent color outputs, we can deduce that the nonce word ""walm"" serves as an instruction to repeat the color output of the previous word in the sequence.

For instance:
- ""zup walm dax"" resulted in ""yellow yellow green"", where ""walm"" caused a repetition of ""yellow"" which was the output for ""zup"".
- ""dax walm zup lug dax"" resulted in ""green green green yellow blue green"", where the first occurrence of ""walm"" led to the first ""green"" being repeated twice more.

Therefore, the rule we can establish for the nonce word ""walm"" is that it instructs to repeat the color output of the word immediately before it in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color output of the previous word.",1.0,101,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's break down the given examples by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs. We'll examine the positioning of ""walm"" and the resulting color pattern.

1. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""dax,"" generating a yellow-blue-green pattern.

2. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   ""Walm"" follows ""zup,"" leading to three yellows, then a blue.

3. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   ""Walm"" follows ""dax,"" resulting in three greens, then a yellow and a blue.

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   ""Walm"" is the last word and follows ""lug,"" with the output colors green-blue, then repeating blues.

5. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow
   ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup,"" leading to a green-yellow pattern.

From these examples, we can induce the following rule about ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, it seems to generate a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times, followed by the colors that would normally be associated with the words following ""walm.""

Based on this rule, we can reasonably suggest the following meaning for ""walm"":

walm -> The repetition of the preceding color output three times, followed by the normal sequence of colors.",0.8,101,walm
"To deduce the meaning or rule of ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples one by one with respect to their inputs and outputs:

1. Input: `zup walm dax zup dax wif`
   Output: `yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red`
   - Here, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
   - The word ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" and before ""dax,"" and all the three instances of ""zup"" are followed by ""yellow,"" while the first ""dax"" after ""walm"" results in ""green.""

2. Input: `zup walm lug wif`
   Output: `yellow yellow yellow blue red`
   - ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" ""lug"" in ""blue,"" and ""wif"" in ""red.""
   - ""walm"" is followed by three yellows.

3. Input: `dax walm zup lug dax`
   Output: `green green green yellow blue green`
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
   - After ""walm,"" the word ""zup"" becomes ""yellow"" instead of its previous instances of resulting in ""green.""

4. Input: `dax lug walm`
   Output: `green blue blue blue`
   - ""dax"" leads to green and ""lug"" to blue.
   - After ""walm,"" we see that ""lug"" still translates to ""blue.""

5. Input: `dax walm zup`
   Output: `green green green yellow`
   - ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, we can see that ""walm"" seems to be dictating a repeat or perhaps an extension effect on the color given by the word immediately preceding it. This word, however, does not replace the color represented by the following word, if it’s a different color-indicating word (e.g., ""lug"" for blue, ""zup"" for yellow). Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" may be:

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" causes the next word to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before ""walm,"" for one additional time than it would without ""walm.""

Regardless of context or what follows ""zup,"" whenever the word appears, it is represented by the word ""yellow"" in the output.

When ""zup"" is paired with another word, the second word appears to dictate a secondary color:

- ""dax"" leads to ""green""
- ""lug"" leads to ""blue""
- ""walm"" is a bit unclear but seems to lead to ""red"" based on ""wif walm lug"" giving ""red red red blue"" 

When ""zup"" appears twice as in ""zup lug zup lug"", it results in an alternating pattern of ""yellow blue yellow blue,"" where ""zup"" is followed by its paired color repeatedly. 

Additional notes:
- It appears that the word ""zup"" on its own does not impact the subsequent words' color mapping.
- There is no clear rule for ""walm"" as it only appears in one example ""zup wif walm lug"". The repetition of ""red"" thrice could at first glance imply some sort of repetition rule, but it would be speculative without more examples. 
- Without conflicting examples, it is assumed that ""zup"" will always result in the output starting with ""yellow,"" and the color representing any following words is appended after ""yellow.""",1.0,102,zup

- When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" it appears to produce a repetition of ""red,"" suggesting ""walm"" indicates repetition of the preceding color word.

Putting this together:

- When ""zup"" appears by itself, the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output changes to ""yellow red.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output changes to ""yellow green.""
- When ""zup"" is repeated with another word in between, such as ""lug,"" it seems to alternate its representation with the following word, as in ""yellow blue yellow blue.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""wif"" and additional words such as ""walm lug,"" ""wif"" retains its representation as ""red,"" and ""lug"" as ""blue,"" but the additional word ""walm"" is replicated in the output color sequence as ""red.""

From these observations, we can infer the following:

Rule:
- ""zup"" implies the color ""yellow.""
- When followed by another word, ""zup"" seems to prompt that next word's associated color.
- Each word following ""zup"" has its own color representation: ""wif"" for ""red,"" ""dax"" for ""green,"" and ""lug"" for ""blue.""
- If ""zup"" is not followed by any word, it only implies its associated color, yellow.
- Duplicate words following ""zup"" produce repeated colors according to the word's associated color, as seen in the last example.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

zup -> yellow. When followed by a word, it cues that word's corresponding color.",0.8,102,zup
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""green."" 

Therefore, the rule induction based on the given examples is: bluf -> green.",1.0,102,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer a correspondence between the input words and the output colors. Each distinct word in the input has a matching color in the output.

To determine the meaning of ""bluf"", let's identify the output color each time ""bluf"" is present in the input:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""green"".
- In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- In the fourth example, there's a single ""bluf"", which also corresponds to ""red"".
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"".

Considering there is an inconsistency where ""bluf"" leads to different colors, we can rule out that ""bluf"" corresponds to a single constant color. Instead, we should look for a pattern or a rule that determines the color based on the context.

One possible pattern is positional:  
- In examples 1, 2, and 5, ""bluf"" is followed by a word that has already appeared in the sequence. Each of these times, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"". It implies that ""bluf"" may mean ""repeat the last color"", though this doesn't hold true for example 3.  
- In example 3, both incidences of ""bluf"" lead to the color ""blue"", which precedes them.  
- In example 4, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"" which has not been mentioned before. Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"", which had been mentioned earlier in the sequence.

Given that ""bluf"" leads to ""green"" when a repeat occurs and to ""red"" in the fourth example where ""red"" was recently mentioned in the sequence, it's reasonable to deduce that ""bluf"" is contextually dependent on the surrounding words.

However, another pattern could be frequency-dependent, where ""bluf"" represents the color that appears most frequently among the preceding words. This holds true for the first, second, and fifth examples where ""bluf"" yields ""green"" after ""dax"" was mentioned (which corresponds to ""green""). This does not hold true in the third example where ""bluf"" results in ""blue"", and ""blue"" was not the most frequent color preceding ""bluf"".

Lastly, let's consider that ""bluf"" could involve a pattern of anticipation or alteration:

- In examples 1 and 2, ""bluf"" precedes words that have appeared before, so we might infer ""bluf"" signifies an upcoming repeat, yielding ""green"" as a placeholder for repetition.
- In example 3, ""bluf"" could anticipate ""wif"" which was used earlier and is associated with ""red"", but it results in ""blue"", which doesn't fit the pattern.
- Example 4 doesn't fit well with any of these patterns, as ""bluf"" yields ""red"", with no clear reason based on the previous words.
- In example 5, with only three words, ""bluf"" yields ""green"" following ""dax"" (green), but without a clear pattern relating to anticipation or alteration.

From these observations, it is challenging to deduce a clear, consistent rule for ""bluf"". However, based on the majority of examples, one could tentatively propose:

bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" may indicate a repeat or an anticipation of repetition, commonly resulting in the color ""green"" but does not hold when new sequences are started or other unaccounted variables are introduced. Rule: Tentatively, ""bluf"" is related to repetition but the rule is not consistent across all examples. More data would be needed to confirm a rule.",0.2,102,bluf
Rule: bluf -> blue,0.0,102,bluf
Rule: bluf -> blue,0.0,102,bluf
"bluf -> blue

Rule: Each occurrence of the word ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.",0.0,102,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the rule that represents the meaning of ""walm."" Let's analyze the appearances of ""walm"" and the outputs:

1. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green.""
2. ""dax walm wif dax"" results in ""green green green red green."" Here we notice that aside from the ""walm,"" the presence of ""wif"" followed by ""dax"" results in a ""red"" output after the ""green green green"" that corresponds to ""dax walm.""
3. ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green."" The ""walm"" at the end still induces ""green green green"" as seen before, and ""wif bluf"" precedes it with ""red red.""
4. ""zup wif walm lug"" results in ""yellow red red red blue."" Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" leading to ""red,"" which is different from any previous example. Since ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" it's not affecting the ""walm"" directly. We must then consider how ""wif"" plays a role because it precedes ""walm"" and is followed by ""red.""

Drawing from these points, we can make an observation that whenever ""walm"" appears, the output consistently includes ""green green green."" The presence of other words before or after ""walm"" affects the colors that appear before or after this ""green green green"" sequence, but not the sequence itself. 

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" in isolation, disregarding potential modifiers like ""wif,"" ""lug,"" or others, can be determined as:

Rule: Whenever ""walm"" is observed, it translates to ""green green green"" in the output.

To articulate this as requested:

walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:
walm -> always results in ""green green green"" in the output, regardless of context.",1.0,102,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the output of three consecutive ""green"". However, it is also important to consider that other words correspond to colors as well, like ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" to red, and so on.

By isolating ""walm"" in different contexts, it is noticeable that its output is consistently ""green green green,"" regardless of the presence or absence of other color-associated words before or after it in the inputs. Consequently, the necessary rule about the word ""walm"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: walm -> ""green green green"" (i.e., walm generates the output of three greens in a row)",1.0,102,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs for patterns that help us deduce its meaning.

1. ""dax walm"" consistently translates to ""green green green."" Since ""dax"" is consistently output as a single ""green,"" ""walm"" must be responsible for the subsequent ""green green.""

2. ""dax walm wif dax"" results in ""green green green red green."" ""Dax"" at the beginning and end is translated to ""green"" at the beginning and end. This implies ""walm wif"" leads to the ""green green red"" in the middle. Since ""wif"" on its own typically results in a ""red,"" it suggests that ""walm"" is directly related to the ""green green"" outputs.

3. ""wif bluf dax walm"" provides the output ""red red green green green."" We can see that ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""bluf"" to red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and the remaining ""green green"" which follows is produced by ""walm.""

4. ""zup wif walm lug"" turns into ""yellow red red red blue."" In this example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" leaving the pair ""red red"" in the center from ""walm.""

By comparing these instances, it is evident that ""walm"" consistently results in ""green green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: walm -> ""green green""",0.8,102,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", we should look at the position and surrounding words in each example and their corresponding outputs. Let's analyze each statement and the corresponding output:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   
2. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

4. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

5. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

Analyzing the examples:

- In examples 1 and 3, ""dax walm"" consistently translates to ""green green green"". We can assume that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", but we're not sure about ""walm"" yet.
- In example 2, the addition of ""wif dax"" at the end changes the output to ""green green green red green"". ""wif"" might correspond with ""red"", and since ""dax"" is still ""green"", ""walm"" hasn't affected the output based on its presence.
- In example 4, ""wif"" is still followed by ""red"" and ""dax"" is still followed by ""green""; ""walm"" here follows ""dax"", just like in examples 1 and 3, and the pattern ""green green green"" is still intact, which further reinforces that ""walm"" does not interrupt this green sequence.
- In example 5, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and finally ""lug"" to ""blue"". The word ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""lug"" with the output being ""red red red blue"". Since we have three instances of ""red"", it's logical to consider that ""walm"" might induce the repetition of the color of the word that comes right before it (in this case, ""red"").

Based on these observations, a possible rule for ""walm"" could be:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word that precedes it.

In essence:

walm -> meaning: causes a repetition of the color associated with the previous word in the output sequence.",0.8,102,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to identify the pattern associated with ""walm"" based on the given inputs and outputs. Let's analyze each example.

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   
2. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

4. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

5. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

Observations:

- The word ""walm"" always correlates with three ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input.
- In examples 2 and 3, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and leads to ""green green green.""
- In example 4, ""walm"" also follows a ""dax,"" even if there are other words like ""wif bluf"" before ""dax,"" and the sequence ""green green green"" follows as well.
- In example 5, ""walm"" does not follow ""dax"" and is instead preceded by ""wif,"" and we do not see the ""green green green"" pattern but a sequence of ""red red red.""

From these observations, we can infer that the word ""walm"" may trigger the output ""green green green"" when it follows the word ""dax,"" and it does not yield this sequence when ""dax"" is not present before ""walm."" The changes in the output color seem to depend on the position and the context provided by the other words, not just the presence of ""walm.""

Based on this, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows the word ""dax"" in the input, the output is ""green green green."" If ""walm"" is present without a preceding ""dax,"" the pattern does not hold, and the associated output colors change accordingly.",0.8,102,walm

"Given the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" directly translates to a specific color each time it is used, regardless of its position in the sentence or the words around it. In every instance where ""dax"" appears, the word ""green"" is the corresponding output.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green",1.0,103,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs. Therefore, the rule appears to be quite straightforward:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,103,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,103,dax

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,103,dax
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,103,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,103,wif
"Based on the examples given, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" correlates to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding output. There doesn't seem to be a positional or contextual dependency evident from the given examples.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,103,wif
"By examining the patterns of input and output, the following observations can be made:

1. ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"".
2. ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"".
3. ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"".
4. ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red"" when it is not preceded by ""wif"".
5. ""wif"" seems to alter the color coming next by one step backward in the established sequence of ""red, blue, yellow, green"".

Now let's analyze the inputs and outputs where ""wif"" is present:

- In the first example, ""wif lug"" translated to ""red blue"" and ""wif lug"" at the end translated back to ""yellow red blue"". The ""wif"" before ""lug"" translated to red, but when another ""wif"" occured before ""lug"", the pattern repeated.
- In the second example, ""wif"" came before ""bluf"" which would normally be ""red"" but ""wif bluf"" translated to ""red red"". ""wif"" itself translated to red, and it seems to have maintained the color of ""bluf"".
- In the third example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"", reinforcing the idea that ""wif"" translates to red and maintains the color red for ""bluf"".
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red"" and ""wif zup wif"" translates to ""red yellow red"". ""wif"" both times translated to red, and it precedes ""zup"" which is yellow, without changing its color.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" appears before ""bluf"" and once more translates to ""red"". ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"", which is consistent with previous patterns.

The consistent rule seems to be:

The word ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and it does not affect the color translation of the word that follows it.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,103,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can see that each instance of ""wif"" correlates to the word ""red."" There doesn't seem to be a positional or contextual factor that affects this outcome. ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" regardless of its position or the words around it. Here is the explanation for each example:

1. Input: ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" -> Output: ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue""
   ""wif"" appears twice and each time it corresponds to ""red."" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

2. Input: ""dax bluf lug wif"" -> Output: ""green green blue red""
   ""wif"" appears at the end and corresponds to ""red.""

3. Input: ""wif bluf"" -> Output: ""red red""
   ""wif"" appears at the beginning and corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: ""lug wif zup wif"" -> Output: ""blue red yellow red""
   ""wif"" appears between other words and at the end, each time corresponding to ""red.""

5. Input: ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" -> Output: ""green blue yellow red red green""
   ""wif"" appears once and corresponds to ""red.""

Rule:
wif -> red.",1.0,103,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" correlates directly with the color ""yellow."" There is no contextual variation, as each instance of ""zup"" directly translates to ""yellow"" in the output:

1. zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
2. lug zup wif lug -> blue yellow red blue
3. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
4. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
5. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,103,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow."" Each instance of the word ""zup"" in the examples corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,103,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following mappings for each nonce word:

- lug -> blue
- bluf -> yellow
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

Each nonce word corresponds to a color, and no matter the position of `zup` in a sequence, it consistently translates to ""yellow"". There's no contextual dependency or variation based on these examples; `zup` is simply a direct substitution for the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,103,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a rule for the meaning of ""zup."" To find a consistent pattern, let's compare the occurrences of ""zup"" in the given input with the corresponding output:

1. zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow 
2. lug zup wif lug -> blue yellow red blue
3. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
4. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
5. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow

In each instance where ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. There are no examples where ""zup"" corresponds to any color other than yellow. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,103,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,103,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" whenever it occurs immediately after the word ""wif."" When ""bluf"" is combined with other words, it seems to generate a repetition of the color that belongs to the word immediately preceding it. For instance, when ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red,"" repeating the color associated with ""wif.""

Now, let's look at the examples to better understand ""bluf"" in different contexts:

Example 1:
- Input: wif bluf
- Output: red red
Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" represents a repetition of the previous color.

Example 2:
- Input: wif dax bluf
- Output: red green green
In this example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and the output is ""green green,"" further supporting the repetition rule.

Example 3:
- Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
- Output: green green red yellow blue
""Bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" leading to ""green green"" in the output.

Example 4:
- Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
- Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
""Bluf"" follows ""wif,"" translating to ""red,"" and resulting in ""red red"" in the output.

Example 5:
- Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
- Output: red red yellow red blue green
The first ""bluf"" repetition rule applies after ""wif,"" giving us ""red red."" The second occurrence of ""wif"" doesn't have a ""bluf"" to directly follow, so in this context, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to only apply when ""bluf"" directly follows another word.

Rule: ""Bluf"" -> When presented in a sequence, ""bluf"" leads to the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. If ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" it specifically results in ""red red.""",1.0,103,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", let's analyze each input/output pair:

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   Observation: The appearance of ""wif"" correlates to a single ""red"". The addition of ""bluf"" results in a duplicate ""red"".

2. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   Observation: The presence of ""dax"" correlates to a single ""green"". Here, ""bluf"" might be transforming the subsequent ""green"" into a duplicate, similar to how ""red"" was duplicated.

3. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
   Output: green green red yellow blue
   Observation: ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"" again, followed by two ""green"" in the output, and follows the previous pattern of duplicating the color associated with the word preceding it (""dax"" -> ""green"").

4. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   Observation: The sequence contains ""lug"" generating ""blue"", ""wif"" producing ""red"", and ""bluf"" duplicating the ""red"". ""zup"" and ""walm"" both produce ""yellow"". Again, ""bluf"" appears to duplicate the color of the word that precedes it.

5. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
   Output: red red yellow red blue green
   Observation: We see ""wif"" -> ""red"", followed by ""bluf"", which results in a second ""red"". Then ""zup"" -> ""yellow"", another ""wif"" -> ""red"", ""lug"" -> ""blue"", and finally ""dax"" -> ""green"".

Rule:
bluf -> The rule appears to be that ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.",1.0,103,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" I will look for patterns in the input and corresponding output. I'll analyze each input-output pair for consistencies.

1. Input: ""wif bluf""
   Output: ""red red""
   Analysis: ""wif"" results in ""red."" The appearance of ""bluf"" after ""wif"" repeats the color associated with ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

2. Input: ""wif dax bluf""
   Output: ""red green green""
   Analysis: Here ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""dax"" is ""green."" Again, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color preceding it, which is ""green.""

3. Input: ""dax bluf wif zup lug""
   Output: ""green green red yellow blue""
   Analysis: Each word is associated with a color. ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" Again, ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

4. Input: ""zup walm lug wif bluf""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""
   Analysis: ""zup"" yields ""yellow,"" ""lug"" yields ""blue,"" and ""wif"" yields ""red."" ""walm"" is not directly associated with a color, but it seems to echo the color of ""zup,"" which is ""yellow."" When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""red"" twice, indicating that ""bluf"" reflects the color of the preceding word, which is ""red.""

5. Input: ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax""
   Output: ""red red yellow red blue green""
   Analysis: Each non-bluf word maintains its associated color. ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" again supporting the repetition rule for ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.
",1.0,103,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the output pattern is a sequence of color names that correspond to each input word. However, the word ""bluf"" consistently leads to the color ""red"" in the output, and when ""bluf"" appears immediately after ""wif,"" it leads to ""red red."" Given this pattern, it is reasonable to deduce that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" and when associated with ""wif,"" the word ""bluf"" is repeated in the output.

Rule: bluf -> red (and if preceded by ""wif,"" output ""red"" twice).",1.0,103,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" translates into ""red red"". Every instance where the input contains ""bluf"", the output always includes the sequence ""red red"".

However, we also notice a pattern for the other words: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"". 

The rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it translates directly to ""red red"" independent of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: bluf -> red red",1.0,103,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns related to the output and see how ""walm"" influences these outputs.

1. Whenever ""walm"" is present in the input, the associated color in the output seems to be related to the most recent color mentioned before ""walm.""
   - Input: ""wif walm dax zup"" -> Output: ""red red red green yellow""; the color before ""walm"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" outputs more ""red.""
   - Input: ""wif dax lug walm"" -> Output: ""red green blue blue blue""; ""blue"" is the color before ""walm,"" and ""walm"" outputs more ""blue.""
   - Input: ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> Output: ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""; ""yellow"" is the color before ""walm,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""yellow.""
   - Input: ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""; ""yellow"" is the color before ""walm,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""yellow.""
   - Input: ""dax zup dax walm"" -> Output: ""green yellow green green green""; ""green"" is the color before ""walm,"" and ""walm"" outputs more ""green.""

Based on these examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" outputs a sequence of the most recently mentioned color. Hence:

Rule: walm -> repeats the most recent color mentioned before it.",1.0,103,walm
"Analyzing the examples given, we notice a pattern associated with the word ""walm"" and the colors in the output. Let's break down each example:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   
   Observing the sequence, we see that every instance of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" which is followed by ""walm"" also outputting ""red."" Following ""walm"" is ""dax"" resulting in ""green,"" and finally ""zup"" gives ""yellow.""

2. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   
   In this sequence, ""walm"" is at the end, and all colors preceding it are following a pattern related to their corresponding words (""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue""). The output for ""walm"" is ""blue,"" matching the previous color.

3. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   
   Here, there are a series of colors corresponding to their words, and ""walm"" appears after ""zup,"" which has the color ""yellow."" The color for ""walm"" here also happens to be ""yellow,"" which follows the previous color.

4. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   
   Again, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" and the output color for ""walm"" continues to be ""yellow.""

5. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   
   ""Walm"" comes after ""dax,"" which is associated with ""green,"" and the color output for ""walm"" is also ""green.""

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it takes on the color of the last color that was output before it. Hence, ""walm"" seems to mean ""repeat the previous color.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color.",1.0,103,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" appears to correspond with a repetition of the color mentioned just before it. Looking through the examples, whenever the word ""walm"" is used, the output color matches the color of the word immediately preceding it.

- In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the color for ""dax"" is green, so ""walm"" results in green.
- In the second example, ""lug"" is blue, and it is followed by ""walm,"" which also outputs blue.
- The third example again shows ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" and the color sequence blue followed by blue.
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" with the output color being yellow for both.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" with both having the output color green.

Therefore, the rule is:

walm -> meaning. Walm represents a repeat of the color output assigned to the word immediately before it.",1.0,103,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the output corresponding to its presence in each example:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   
   In this sequence, ""wif"" and ""dax"" correspond to the color red and green respectively. The word ""walm"" is followed by the color red, but since ""wif"" already corresponds to red, it may not be conclusive to say ""walm"" also means red. ""Zup"" corresponds to yellow, but since ""walm"" is followed by red, it cannot mean yellow either.

2. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   
   In this sequence, ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" correspond to red, green, and blue respectively. The word ""walm"" is followed by three blue colors. This could indicate a repetition or duplication function.

3. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   
   Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""dax"" to green. ""Bluf"" may not have a clear correspondence but ""zup"" seems to correspond to yellow. ""Walm"" comes before three yellows, similar to how in example 2 it came before three blues, which again suggests a possible repetition or duplication.

4. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   
   ""Zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" to blue. After ""walm,"" there are three yellow outputs, which may support the pattern where ""walm"" precedes multiple repeats of a color.

5. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   
   ""Dax"" corresponds to green and ""zup"" to yellow. After ""walm,"" the color green is repeated three times.

From the examples given, it seems that ""walm"" may correspond to the rule of causing a repetition of the color that follows the word ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> causes the next color word to repeat three times.",0.9,103,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to a color, but the specific color that ""walm"" refers to changes depending on its position or context within the input.

Examining the outputs corresponding to ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of three ""red"" and then a ""green"" and ""yellow"".
- In the second example, it translates to three ""blue"" colors.
- In the third example, it corresponds to one ""yellow"" followed by three ""blue"" colors.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" results in three consecutive ""yellow"" colors.
- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""walm"" corresponds to three ""green"" colors.

By looking at these examples, a pattern emerges where ""walm"" seems to be associated with the repetition of the color output indicated by the immediately preceding color word an increasing number of times, starting from two repeated colors and the sequence then followed by the two colors that would come next in the sequence.

To elaborate, we have a sequence indicated as follows:
- Red (""wif"") -> Green -> Blue -> Yellow

After a color word and before ""walm"", the output color repeats itself based on an incrementing count starting at two, then the series moves through the color sequence without skipping any colors.

Let’s use this pattern to confirm the rule with the examples:

1. wif walm -> wif is red, so walm is red (twice, because it is the first occurrence) -> [red red] then the sequence Green, Yellow.

2. wif dax lug walm -> lug is blue, so walm is blue (three times, as it is the third color word before ""walm"") -> [blue blue blue]

3. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> zup is yellow, so walm is yellow (once, then starts from the beginning since it's reached the end of the sequence) followed by three blues to complete the rule -> [yellow] + [blue blue blue]

4. zup bluf lug zup walm -> zup is yellow, so walm is another three yellows, because yellow is the color before ""walm"" and it's the second occurrence from the pattern start -> [yellow yellow yellow]

5. dax zup dax walm -> dax is green, so walm is green (three times, because it's the color before ""walm"") -> [green green green]

Rule:
walm -> Replicates the color indicated by the previous word, starting with two repetitions and following the sequence red -> green -> blue -> yellow, and then increments the count by one for each additional placement of ""walm"" but resets the number of repetitions back to two when it is followed by a new color. After completing the count for a specific color, the following colors are the subsequent ones in the red -> green -> blue -> yellow sequence.",0.8,103,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can infer the following:

1. Whenever the word ""lug"" appears by itself, the output is ""blue"".
2. When ""lug"" is preceded or followed by other words, it similarly corresponds to the word ""blue"", and does not appear to affect the colors associated with the other words.

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs:

1. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
2. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
3. zup bluf wif dax lug -> yellow yellow red green blue
4. zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
5. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green

The word “bluf” appears in each input sentence. By analyzing the output of each example, let's look for a pattern for the word “bluf”:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" again.
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" produces ""yellow.""
4. In the fourth example, we see ""bluf"" twice, and it translates both times to ""yellow.""
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" again translates to ""green.""

The immediate observation is that ""bluf"" does not consistently map to a single color. Therefore, we must consider the context in which ""bluf"" is used. By comparing the outputs, we can note that ""bluf"" generates the same color as the word that comes directly before it:

1. wif bluf -> red red
2. wif bluf -> red red
3. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
4. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
5. dax bluf -> green green

This pattern consistently holds in all examples given. Therefore, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of ""bluf"":

Rule: The word “bluf” takes on the same color meaning as the word directly preceding it in the sequence.",1.0,104,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"", we need to analyze the patterns and the specific color output each instance of ""bluf"" produces.

In the first example, ""bluf"" appears and the corresponding output is ""red,"" appearing twice for the word ""bluf dax"". This could suggest a rule where ""bluf"" means red and ""dax"" means green, or a combined rule that ""bluf dax"" means ""red green"". However, we see in further examples that ""dax"" on its own also correlates with the output of green, suggesting ""bluf"" correlates with red independently.

In the second example, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red"". The third example confirms this rule since ""bluf"" on its own produces ""yellow"" (from ""zup"") followed by a red output.

In the fourth example, ""bluf"" appears twice and each time it is followed by the color red in the output.

The fifth example confirms that the output color that corresponds to ""bluf"" is red, as it once again follows with the green that corresponds with ""dax"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
bluf -> red",1.0,104,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the association between the inputs and the outputs in each example. 

First, we can see that the word ""bluf"" always corresponds with the color ""green"" in the output sequence. Notice that in every instance of ""bluf"" in the input, regardless of the position or the words around it, it results in ""green"" in the output.

Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green
Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red
Input: zup bluf wif dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow red green blue
Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green

Rule: bluf -> green",1.0,104,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can compare the inputs and their corresponding outputs to identify patterns:

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
Output: yellow yellow red green blue

Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green

From these examples, it's clear that each word in the input is associated with a specific color in the output. By analyzing the patterns, we can attempt to determine the meaning of ""bluf"":

1. ""wif"" consistently translates to red.
2. ""dax"" consistently translates to green.
3. ""lug"" consistently translates to blue.
4. ""zup"" consistently translates to yellow.
5. Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, it corresponds to green in the output, but there are instances where ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" or followed by ""wif,"" which also map to green and red, respectively.

Notably, whenever ""bluf"" is present in the sequence, it seems to replicate the color output of the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence, if there is one. When ""bluf"" is the first word in the sequence or is preceded by ""zup"" (which maps to yellow), the output for ""bluf"" is yellow, but in the third position onwards or when followed by another word like ""wif"" or ""dax,"" we have outputs like this:

- ""dax bluf"" --> ""green green""
- ""bluf wif"" --> ""yellow red""
- ""zup bluf wif"" --> ""yellow yellow red""
- ""zup dax bluf"" --> ""yellow green green""

Based on these observations, we can determine that ""bluf"" seems to take on the color output of either the preceding word or, if it is the first word or preceded by ""zup,"" it defaults to yellow. 

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word or defaults to yellow if it's the first word or preceded by ""zup"".",0.8,104,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,0.6,104,bluf
"Based on the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it continuously until a new color word appears. For instance, whenever ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" ""red"" repeats in the output. Similarly, following ""lug,"" ""blue"" repeats, and following ""zup,"" ""yellow"" repeats. Thus, ""walm"" seems to indicate repetition of the previous color.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,104,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine each instance where it appears and the corresponding output colors:

1. wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green
2. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
3. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
4. zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
5. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

We can notice that following each ""walm,"" the output is a repetition of the same color (green, yellow, red, yellow, and red, respectively). This repetition matches the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""walm.""

To solidify this finding, we can notice:

- After ""dax walm,"" which occurs in example 1 and example 5, ""green"" is repeated three times.
- After ""lug zup walm,"" which appears in example 2, ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- After ""zup wif walm,"" which appears in example 3, ""red"" is repeated three times.
- After ""zup walm,"" which appears in example 4, ""yellow"" is repeated twice (the next word ""lug"" ends the repetition).
- After ""wif walm,"" which occurs in example 5, ""red"" is repeated three times (the next word ""lug"" ends the repetition).

Thus, the rule seems to be that the word ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. The repetition appears to continue until a new word (not ""walm"") appears.

Rule: walm -> triggers repetition of the color associated with the preceding word until a new (non-""walm"") word is introduced.",1.0,104,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of the color associated with the word that directly follows it. Here are the patterns observed:

In the first example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" indicating ""walm"" might cause the color ""green"" from ""dax"" to be repeated thrice.

In the second example, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" again supporting that ""walm"" might be causing the repetition.

In the third example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" further supporting the repetition pattern.

In the fourth example, the pattern holds as ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" following by the other individual color associations.

In the fifth example, ""zup walm"" again results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and after ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" the pattern of ""walm"" follows suit again, causing repetition.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the next word to be repeated three times.",1.0,104,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to result in repetitions of the color that follows it. Each instance of ""walm"" is followed by a series of colors that are identical until a new color word appears. However, let's examine each example to understand how the repetitions work.

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green

- ""Wif"" becomes red, ""lug"" becomes blue, ""dax"" becomes green, and ""walm"" seems to correspond to repeating the color green.

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

- ""Lug"" becomes blue, ""zup"" becomes yellow, and after ""walm,"" the color yellow is repeated until ""lug"" appears again as blue.

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

- ""Zup"" becomes yellow, ""wif"" becomes red, and after ""walm,"" the color red is repeated until ""lug"" appears as blue.

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

- ""Zup"" becomes yellow, ""walm"" leads to repeating yellow, ""lug"" changes to blue, then ""zup"" is yellow again, followed by ""wif"" as red and ""dax"" as green.

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

- ""Dax"" becomes green, ""wif"" becomes red, ""walm"" leads to repeating red, ""lug"" changes to blue, ""zup"" shifts to yellow, and another ""walm"" results in yellow being repeated.

The rule seems consistent across all examples: whenever ""walm"" appears, it causes the color word that immediately follows it to repeat until a different color word is encountered.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color word that comes after it until a new color word is encountered.",1.0,104,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the given input-output pairs and look for patterns:

1. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   (walm corresponds to green)

2. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   (walm corresponds to yellow)

3. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   (walm corresponds to red)

4. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   (walm corresponds to second yellow)

5. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   (walm corresponds to second red and fourth yellow)

It appears that ""walm"" does not correspond to a static color, but the output color is dependent on its position relative to a preceding word/color. By examining the output colors following ""walm,"" we can notice the following pattern:

- When ""walm"" appears, the first time it adopts the color of the previously mentioned distinct color-word in the sequence, and the subsequent ""walm"" instances continue with the pattern in the output sequence if there is no intervening distinct color-word.

Based on this observation, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> ""walm"" takes the color of the most recent color-word preceding it, and this color continues in the sequence until a different color-word appears.

For example:
- ""wif lug dax walm"" had ""dax"" before walm, and ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""walm"" leads to green green.
- In ""lug zup walm lug,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow before ""walm,"" so ""walm"" leads to yellow. Then ""lug"" is said again, which resets the color to blue.
- ""zup wif walm lug"" has ""wif"" before ""walm,"" making ""walm"" result in red, and this continues until ""lug"" which is blue.

Thus, the rule is:
Rule: walm -> meaning. ""walm"" takes on the color of the previous distinct color-word in the sequence and duplicates it until another distinct color-word appears afterwards.",0.9,104,walm

Rule: dax -> green,1.0,105,dax
"Based on the examples provided, every instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output. Here's a breakdown of each input and its corresponding output:

1. ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" -> ""green green red yellow red""
The first ""green"" corresponds to the first ""dax.""

2. ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" -> ""yellow blue red green green red""
The ""green"" after the ""red"" corresponds to ""dax.""

3. ""wif dax"" -> ""red green""
""Green"" comes after ""dax.""

4. ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue""
""Green"" corresponds to ""dax.""

5. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
The first ""green"" after ""red"" corresponds to ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,105,dax
"Based on the provided examples, ""dax"" correlates to an output of ""green"" each time it appears. Different words appear to correspond to different colors in the outputs. For example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"".

Thus, the rule appears to be a direct color association for each word.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,105,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the meaning of the word ""dax"" by analyzing the positions where it appears and the corresponding outputs:

In the first example:
- ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" results in ""green green red yellow red""

In the second example:
- ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" results in ""yellow blue red green green red""

In the third example:
- ""wif dax"" results in ""red green""

In the fourth example:
- ""dax lug"" results in ""green blue""

In the fifth example:
- ""wif dax bluf"" results in ""red green green""

When ""dax"" appears right before any other word, that word is translated to ""green"". Therefore, it seems like the presence of ""dax"" causes the subsequent word to translate to ""green"", regardless of what the subsequent word usually translates to.

Rule: When ""dax"" precedes a word, that word is translated as ""green"".",1.0,105,dax
"From the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" is consistently associated with the output ""green."" Whenever dax is present in the input, the word immediately following ""dax"" is translated to ""green"" in the output. The color that follows ""green"" in the output corresponds to the word immediately after ""dax"" in the input, as follows:

- ""bluf"" corresponds to green.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- When ""dax"" is followed by no other word, no color follows green.

Here are the specific relations seen in the examples:

- In example 1, ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green"".
- In example 2, ""dax bluf"" again leads to ""green green"", despite a different surrounding context.
- In example 3, ""wif dax"" leads to ""red green"", with ""wif"" corresponding to red by itself.
- In example 4, ""dax lug"" leads to ""green blue"".
- In example 5, ""wif dax bluf"" leads to ""red green green"".

Given this pattern, the rule for dax can be stated as follows:

Rule: When dax appears, the output is ""green"" followed by the color that corresponds to the word immediately after dax. If dax is at the end of the sequence, there is no additional color after ""green"".

Dax -> green",1.0,105,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce a rule for the nonce word ""wif."" The evidence suggests that ""wif"" acts as a color description duplicator or replicator for a color that immediately follows it. When ""wif"" is present before a color word, the output color is repeated according to the number of letters in the following word. 

For example:
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" has four letters, hence ""red red"".
- In ""wif lug,"" ""lug"" has three letters, hence ""red blue"".
- In ""wif dax zup walm,"" only the word immediately following ""wif"" is duplicated, thus ""dax"" causes ""red"" to be repeated once.

Using this rule, we can propose the following meaning for ""wif"":

wif -> Repeat the output color of the immediately following word according to the number of its letters.

Rule: The color associated with ""wif"" depends on the word that comes right after it. The number of repetitions of that color in the output equates to the number of letters in the word that follows ""wif.""",1.0,105,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" appears to influence the output by generating a sequence of colors. Each given input that contains ""wif"" results in an output where the first color is always red. However, the rest of the sequence seems to be determined by the words following ""wif.""

Here is the pattern noticed:

- ""dax"" translates to a sequence of ""green.""
- ""bluf"" seems to always generate the color ""red.""
- ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
- ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" translates to multiple sequent ""green.""

By examining the outputs while considering these mappings and the occurrence of ""wif,"" it seems that ""wif"" functions as a trigger or an initiator for a series of color outputs but does not itself correspond to a color directly. Instead, ""wif"" being the first word of every sequence ensures the first color in the output is ""red"" and then the rules for other words follow.

Rule: wif -> The word ""wif"" triggers the color output sequence with the first color being ""red"", and subsequent colors are determined by the following words.",0.9,105,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" appears to result in a sequence of colored outputs depending on the word that follows it. To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we can analyze the pattern of colors following its occurrence:

1. ""wif bluf"" -> red red
2. ""wif lug"" -> red blue
3. ""wif dax zup walm"" -> red green yellow yellow yellow
4. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

It seems that ""wif"" initiates a sequence where the word immediately following ""wif"" dictates the first color in the output sequence, while the words following the first word after ""wif"" influence the subsequent colors.

- ""bluf"" corresponds to red (seen in examples 1 and 2).
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue (seen in example 2).
- ""dax"" corresponds to green (seen in example 3).
- ""walm"" corresponds to red when following ""wif"" (seen in examples 1 and 4).
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow (seen in examples 3 and 4).

When we analyze the examples where ""wif"" is followed by two non-""wif"" words, such as ""wif dax zup walm"" and ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" we observe that the first word after ""wif"" sets the color, and the subsequent words repeat the pattern of colors for the number of letters in those words. So, ""zup"" results in three yellows because ""zup"" has three letters and ""walm"" results in four reds when it does not immediately follow ""wif.""

Therefore, ""wif"" seems to initiate a color-coding sequence based on the words that follow it, with the rule that the color corresponding to the first word immediately after ""wif"" is issued once and the colors corresponding to subsequent words are repeated based on the count of letters in each of those words.

Rule: wif -> initiates a pattern where the word immediately following ""wif"" determines the first color output, and each word after outputs their corresponding color repeated by the count of letters in them.",0.9,105,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to a repeated pattern of colors according to the length of the word that follows it. Here's the inferred rule based on each instance:

- ""bluf"" (4 letters) follows ""wif"" and results in ""red red"", which is two repetitions of ""red.""
- ""lug"" (3 letters) follows ""wif"" and results in ""red blue"", which is ""red"" followed by one ""blue.""
- ""dax"" (3 letters) coupled with ""zup walm"" (3 and 4 letters, respectively) follows ""wif"" and results in ""red green yellow yellow yellow"", which is ""red,"" ""green,"" then ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" (4 letters), ""zup"" (3 letters), ""lug"" (3 letters), ""zup"" (3 letters), and ""walm"" (4 letters) follow ""wif"", the output is ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"". In this case, ""wif"" causes the first color, ""red,"" to be repeated three times, then the pattern follows the rule of repeated colors corresponding to the number of letters in each subsequent word (""zup"" - 3 letters - ""yellow"" repeated once, ""lug"" - 3 letters - ""blue"", ""zup"" - 3 letters - ""yellow"" repeated once, and ""walm"" - 4 letters - ""yellow"" repeated twice).

The rule appears to be that ""wif"" causes the next color to be repeated a number of times that corresponds to the number of letters in the word that directly follows ""wif"". However, this does not fully explain all the repetitions, for instance, why ""walm"" only causes two repetitions when it is four letters long, suggesting that there might be additional nuances or exceptions to the rule that are not clear from the given examples.

- In the second input ""wif walm zup walm,"" the output is ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" From the previous example, we know ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

The presence of ""walm"" before ""lug"" triples the output of ""blue,"" in line with the pattern previously noted.

- Finally, the input ""zup lug walm"" corresponds to the output ""yellow blue blue blue."" We already know ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue."" As in the other examples, ""walm"" triples the appearance of the subsequent color, which is blue.

From the analysis, we can conclude that ""walm"" triples the output occurrence of the color corresponding to the word that follows it.

Rule: walm -> Triples the occurrence of the subsequent color output.",1.0,105,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the color output associated with the presence of ""walm"" in each input compared to the colors associated with the words ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif.""

Input/Output Analysis:
- wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
- wif walm zup walm -> red red red yellow yellow yellow
- lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
- zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red
- zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue

Let's analyze the patterns:
- When ""walm"" appears, it seems to repeat the color of the word before it, resulting in an extended sequence of the same color.
- ""walm"" by itself does not seem to have a base color; instead, its color is contingent on the preceding word.

For example:
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red, ""walm"" results in more red.
- Following ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, ""walm"" results in more blue.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the extended sequence is yellow.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it repeats the color of the preceding word, extending the sequence of that color.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word, extending the sequence.",0.8,105,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we look at the patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs. We want to examine what changes when ""walm"" is present and compare the outputs to the other words that appear before and after ""walm.""

Let's break it down by each input and its output:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup => Output: red red red green yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
   - ""walm"" also corresponds to red.
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

2. Input: wif walm zup walm => Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
   - ""walm"" corresponds to red the first time and yellow the second time.
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

3. Input: lug walm dax => Output: blue blue blue green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
   - ""walm"" corresponds to blue.
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.

4. Input: zup dax walm lug wif => Output: yellow green green green blue red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - ""walm"" corresponds to green.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.

5. Input: zup lug walm => Output: yellow blue blue blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
   - ""walm"" corresponds to blue.

Looking at the sequences, the word ""walm"" does not have a consistent color associated with it across examples, but rather it takes on the color of the preceding word in the sequence. Where ""walm"" is the second word, it repeats the color of the first word (""red"" in the first example and ""blue"" in the third and fifth examples). The exception is in the second example where ""walm"" first repeats the color red from ""wif"" and then after ""zup"" it repeats the color yellow.

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word in the sequence. If there is no preceding word (i.e., ""walm"" is the first word), the default color appears to be red, as derived from the first example where ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which outputs red. However, this default assumption is based solely on the provided examples. Further examples would be required to confirm this default color.",0.8,105,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the correlation between its occurrences and the corresponding output colors in each given example. Below I have listed the examples with the position of ""walm"" being noted, and the resulting output colors immediately following ""walm"":

1. Input: wif walm dax zup 
   Output: red red red green yellow
   
2. Input: wif walm zup walm 
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
   
3. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   
4. Input: zup dax walm lug wif 
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   
5. Input: zup lug walm 
   Output: yellow blue blue blue

Observing the patterns, ""walm"" is followed by repetitions of the color that corresponds to the immediately preceding word. For example, in the first input, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" there is one ""green"" in the output. In the second input, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" there are three ""yellow"" in the output, likely because ""walm"" occurs twice. In the third input, after ""walm,"" there's one ""green"" following it, corresponding to the word ""dax"" which came before ""walm."" In the fourth input, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is followed by two ""blue,"" which corresponds to ""lug."" Lastly, in the fifth input, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" again and is followed by three ""blue.""

Another rule seems to be the number of repetitions of the color after ""walm,"" which appears to correspond to the number of times ""walm"" has appeared cumulatively in the input. For instance, the second ""walm"" in the second input results in three ""yellow,"" while the first occurrence causes one repetition.

Considering the examples, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the output color that corresponds to the word prior to ""walm"" to repeat an amount of times equal to the cumulative count of ""walm"" within the input sequence.

"walm -> the color of the preceding word repeated. Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat the color of the word that comes before it in the sequence.",1.0,106,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" dictates the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. For each occurrence of ""walm,"" the color of the prior word is repeated the number of times ""walm"" appears successively. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first input, ""dax"" correlates with green and is followed by ""wif"" (red), then ""walm lug"" where ""lug"" correlates with blue, and finally ""walm."" The sequence is: green (dax), red (wif), red (walm repeating the color of wif), red (lug), blue (walm repeating the color of lug), yellow (lug), yellow (walm repeating the color of lug), yellow (walm repeating the color of lug).
  
- In the second input, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" which repeats the green color of ""dax"" three times.

- In the third input, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" to green, ""walm"" repeats the green color, ""zup"" is again yellow, and ""wif"" is red.

- In the fourth input, ""lug"" (blue) is followed by ""walm"" which repeats the blue color three times, then ""zup"" (yellow), ""lug"" (blue), and ""walm"" again repeating the blue color three times.

- In the fifth input, ""zup"" (yellow) is followed by ""walm,"" which repeats the yellow color three times.

The rule can then be stated as follows:

Rule: Walm -> Repetition of the color of the preceding word for each occurrence of ""walm"".",1.0,106,walm
"walm -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that the word ""walm"" when included in an input sequence causes the adjacent word to repeat its corresponding output color three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the color associated with that word is outputted three times.",1.0,106,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the provided input-output pairs:

1. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

3. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red

4. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

Rule:
Every time the word ""walm"" appears in the input, the output color sequence includes three repeated colors, which are derived from the previous color word. For instance:

- In example 1, the first ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" which corresponds to red. Thus, the output sequence for ""walm"" is ""red red red."" The second ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow. Thus, the second output sequence for ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In example 2, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to green, hence ""walm"" results in ""green green green.""
- In example 3, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and gives us ""green green green"" again after ""zup"" translated to yellow and ""dax"" to green beforehand.
- In example 4, both instances of ""walm"" are preceded by ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, leading to ""blue blue blue"" each time.
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which gives us yellow, leading to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to be a rule that means to repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each provided example.",1.0,107,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" Other words that appear with dax have different corresponding outputs: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Taking each example into consideration:

- Input: dax

- Input: wif lug dax

- Input: dax

- Input: dax bluf zup

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

- When the word ""dax"" follows the word ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" the output for ""dax"" remains ""green.""
- When the word ""dax"" follows the phrase ""wif walm,"" which corresponds to ""red red red,"" the output for ""dax"" is still ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"" and then ""zup,"" it appears that ""dax"" retains its original meaning since the output starts with ""green,"" followed by ""green"" for ""bluf"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

- ""walm"" also translates to ""red,"" as it's repeated thrice in the output when it's the only word besides ""dax"" in the input

4. The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
5. We don't have an example of ""lug"" or ""walm"" without ""wif"" to determine their individual outputs.

From these observations, the common rule appears to be that certain nonce words map to specific colors. Applying this rule to the word ""dax"":

"From the given examples, the word ""zup"" seems to consistently correspond to the output ""yellow."" There is no indication from the provided examples that the meaning of ""zup"" changes depending on context or position within the input. Therefore, the rule appears to be straightforward.

"Given the examples, it seems that ""zup"" is a word that can be inserted between other words in a sequence. The output sequences contain color names that correspond to the input words. Each input word other than ""zup"" is consistently translated to the same color, which suggests the following mappings:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- walm -> yellow
- dax -> green

The input word ""zup"" always corresponds to the output color ""yellow."" There are no instances where ""zup"" results in a different output nor does it seem to affect the translation of the surrounding words. This consistency implies that ""zup"" directly translates to ""yellow"" and does not depend on context or modify the meaning of other words.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,107,zup
"Considering the input/output pairs provided, we can try to deduce the underlying rule for the word ""zup"". Each input word appears to translate to a color in the output.

Based on the examples:

1. ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
2. ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".
3. ""walm"" translates to ""yellow"".
4. ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
5. When ""zup"" is present, it consistently translates to ""yellow"".

Now, let's verify the rule by checking each example:

- In ""wif zup"", ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow"". So we get ""red yellow"".
- In ""lug zup walm lug"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""walm"" is ""yellow"", with ""lug"" again at the end. So ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"".
- In ""zup"" alone, it results in ""yellow"".
- In ""lug walm wif zup wif"", we have ""blue"" for ""lug"", ""yellow"" for ""walm"", ""red"" for ""wif"", ""yellow"" for ""zup"", and ""red"" for the last ""wif"". So ""blue blue blue red yellow red"".
- In ""dax zup walm wif"", we have ""green"" for ""dax"", ""yellow"" for ""zup"", ""yellow"" for ""walm"", and ""red"" for ""wif"". So ""green yellow yellow yellow red"".

The rule seems consistent across all examples. Therefore, 

zup -> meaning. Meaning: yellow. Rule: When the word ""zup"" appears, it translates to the color ""yellow"".",1.0,107,zup
"Given the examples, it seems that ""bluf"" directly translates to the color ""green."" However, the examples also indicate that ""bluf"" might be followed by a repetition of that color. When ""bluf"" is not followed by another ""bluf,"" it is translated only once as ""green."" When ""bluf"" is followed immediately by another instance of ""bluf,"" the word ""green"" is repeated in the output.

Observations:
- In every instance, the word ""bluf"" results in the word ""green"" being in the output.
- If ""bluf"" is followed by another ""bluf,"" the word ""green"" is repeated.

Based on these observations, the word ""bluf"" represents the color ""green,"" and there's a pattern of repetition when ""bluf"" is immediately followed by ""bluf.""

Rule:
bluf -> green (with the additional rule that if ""bluf"" is immediately followed by ""bluf,"" the output repeats the color ""green"" twice)",1.0,107,bluf
"Based on the examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a specific color each time it occurs. However, its meaning shifts depending on the word that comes immediately before it.

In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green.""

In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and corresponds to ""yellow,"" but when it follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue,"" and when it follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""

In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red.""

In the fourth example, again ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red.""

Finally, in the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows both ""lug"" and ""dax,"" and the outputs are ""blue"" and ""green,"" respectively.

From this, it appears that the meaning of ""bluf"" is dependent on the word that comes immediately before it in the input, and the pattern of the colors is consistent for each preceding word across all examples:

- If ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the color is ""yellow.""
- If ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the color is ""blue.""
- If ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the color is ""green.""
- If ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the color is ""red.""

Rule: ""bluf"" -> the color outputted by ""bluf"" is determined by the word that immediately precedes it in the following manner:

- zup before bluf: bluf -> yellow
- lug before bluf: bluf -> blue
- dax before bluf: bluf -> green
- wif before bluf: bluf -> red",1.0,107,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, each instance of ""bluf"" correlates with the color ""green"" except when it is preceded by ""wif"", in which case it correlates with ""red.""

Let's analyze:

1st example:
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- bluf -> green

2nd example:
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

By comparing the first and second examples, we see that in the second example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when it follows immediately after ""zup"", and ""blue"" when it follows ""lug"". This suggests that ""bluf"" might actually reflect the color of the word that comes before it. However, this pattern does not fit with the first example, where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" by itself.

3rd example:
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue
- wif -> blue
- bluf -> red

4th example:
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red

5th example:
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> green
- dax -> green
- bluf -> green

In the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" corresponds with ""red"" only when it follows ""wif"". This is consistent across these two cases, indicating a rule that when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"", it means ""red"".

Considering these observations, we can deduce a rule:

Rule: When ""bluf"" appears by itself or after ""zup"" or ""dax,"" it means ""green"". When ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" it means ""red"". However, there is inconsistency when applying this rule to the second example, suggesting that there might be exceptions or additional context needed to fully understand the rule governing ""bluf"".

If we disregard the second example as an anomaly or as potentially containing an error, we could simplify our rule to:

Rule: ""bluf"" generally means ""green"" but changes to ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"".",0.8,107,bluf

Each individual word ""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to a color: ""zup"" to yellow, ""dax"" to green, ""lug"" to blue, and ""wif"" to red. When the word ""walm"" follows any of these words, the corresponding color is repeated three times.

Here's the breakdown:

- In example 1, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"". Hence, ""walm"" repeated ""zup"" which is ""yellow"".
- In example 2, ""zup dax walm wif"" includes a sequence where ""dax"" (green) is followed by ""walm"", resulting in ""green green green"", before concluding with ""wif"" for red.
- In example 3, ""dax walm"" again results in the word ""dax"" being expanded into ""green green green"".
- In example 4, ""dax walm zup walm"" sees ""walm"" used twice, first to repeat ""dax"" (green) three times, and second to repeat ""zup"" (yellow) three times.
- In example 5, ""lug walm zup"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" for ""lug walm,"" and then the sequence continues with ""zup wif"" leading to ""yellow red"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word, it indicates that the color word should be repeated three times in the output.",1.0,107,walm
walm -> meaning. Rule: Walm means repeating the color indicated by the previous word in the sequence three times.,1.0,107,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" generates multiples of a color depending on the previous color-related word. Observing the patterns:

1. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"": ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and results in ""yellow"" being repeated.
2. ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" -> ""blue green yellow green green green red"": ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which correlates with ""green"", resulting in ""green"" being repeated twice after the initial green.
3. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green"": ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) again and yields two additional ""green"".
4. ""dax walm zup walm"" -> ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"": Each instance of ""walm"" repeats the color mentioned just before it three times.
5. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" -> ""green blue blue blue yellow red"": ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and results in ""blue"" being repeated twice more.

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning: Repeat the previously mentioned color three times.",0.8,107,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each instance of ""walm"" translates to multiple consecutive ""green""s in the output. Therefore, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the word ""green"". In each case, the number of times ""green"" appears in a row directly corresponds to the number of times ""dax"" appears before the ""walm"", where each ""dax"" accounts for one ""green"".

To elaborate on the rule:

- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"": Here, ""walm"" is not preceded by ""dax"", hence no ""green"" appears.
- ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" -> ""blue green yellow green green green red"": Here, ""walm"" follows two instances of ""dax"", resulting in ""green green green"".
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green"": ""walm"" follows one instance of ""dax"", resulting in ""green green"".
- ""dax walm zup walm"" -> ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"": Here, the first ""walm"" follows one ""dax"" resulting in ""green green green""; the second ""walm"" does not follow a ""dax"" so it does not produce any ""green"".
- ""dax lug walm zup wif"" -> ""green blue blue blue yellow red"": Here, ""walm"" follows a ""dax"" and a ""lug"", but since only ""dax"" seems to correlate with ""green"", it results in ""blue blue blue"" not ""green green green"".

Given this pattern, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" means ""green"" repeated for the number of times ""dax"" appears directly before it. If there are no instances of ""dax"" before ""walm"", then ""walm"" does not correspond to any ""green"" in the output.",0.8,107,walm
"Given the examples, it seems that ""lug"" translates directly to a color in the outputs. To deduce the rule behind it, let us examine the outputs and their corresponding inputs:

1. Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
   - Here, ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"", same as ""bluf"".

2. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   - ""lug"" is the first word and corresponds to ""blue"".

3. Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
   Output: red red blue green red
   - Here, ""lug"" appears after ""bluf"" and corresponds to the color ""blue"".

4. Input: lug bluf dax bluf
   Output: blue blue green green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" also translates to the same color immediately after, suggesting that ""lug"" might have the same meaning as ""bluf"" or a rule might affect the translation of ""dax"".

5. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   - Again, ""lug"" follows ""bluf"" and translates to ""blue"".

From these examples, the rule for ""lug"" appears consistent:

Rule: lug -> blue

So ""lug"" means blue.",1.0,108,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's look at the provided input-output pairs and see if we can find a pattern.

Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
- Here, ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the output is ""blue blue"". 

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red
- ""Lug"" precedes ""wif"" and the first word in the output is ""blue,"" followed by ""red red"" which corresponds to ""wif bluf"". 

Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
Output: red red blue green red
- ""Lug"" follows ""bluf"" and precedes ""dax."" We can see that the word before ""lug"" is ""bluf"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and the word after ""lug"" is ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green."" ""Lug"" itself corresponds to ""blue"".

Input: lug bluf dax bluf
Output: blue blue green green
- ""Lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""dax"". The corresponding output for ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and for ""bluf"" after ""lug"" is also ""blue."" 

Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue
- ""Lug"" follows ""bluf"" and its corresponding output is ""blue"" while ""wif bluf"" is ""red red.""

Now let's summarize and find the pattern for ""lug"":

- When ""lug"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""blue.""
- When ""lug"" stands alone before ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" changes from the usual ""red"" to ""blue.""
- When ""lug"" follows ""bluf,"" it translates to ""blue.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""dax,"" the output for ""lug"" is ""blue.""

With these considerations, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue,"" regardless of its position. It might be that ""lug"" changes the color that would typically be associated with ""bluf"" from ""red"" to ""blue"" when it's directly before it.

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,108,lug
"Based on the examples provided, the noun ""lug"" appears to be associated with the color ""blue."" Let's examine the evidence:

- Whenever ""lug"" appears in input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output.
- The position of ""lug"" in the input sequence corresponds to the position of ""blue"" in the output sequence.
- Other words in the examples also seem to have consistent color representations: ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""bluf"" also corresponds to blue, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

From the examples given, we can see that each color is represented by a particular word regardless of the order or repetition in the input. Therefore, it seems that ""lug"" specifically translates to the color blue regardless of its position or the context in which it is used.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,108,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it is possible to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs.

Here's how we can figure it out:

- In every instance where ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output. This correspondence suggests a direct translation between the word ""lug"" and the color ""blue"".
- The output sequence does not depend on the position of ""lug"" within the input sequence since ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" regardless of whether it's at the beginning, middle, or end of the sequence.

Based on these observations, we can come up with the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,108,lug
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" Whatever the position of ""lug"" in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue."" 

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,108,lug
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in every given example.",1.0,108,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,108,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" can be deduced by comparing the inputs and outputs. Each instance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output. It does not appear to vary with context or position in the sentence; every time it appears, the output is ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green",1.0,108,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the given examples.",1.0,108,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the given examples, regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,108,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif"", let's analyze each input-output pair and look for patterns associated with the word ""wif"".

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

Here, ""wif"" leads to an output of ""red,"" while ""lug"" results in ""blue.""

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

In this string, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the corresponding output is ""red"" immediately after ""wif,"" while ""bluf"" maps to ""red"". Notably, ""dax"" seems to consistently map to ""green.""

Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red

Similar to the previous example, ""wif"" produces the color ""red,"" with no other new word preceding it to potentially influence this mapping.

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow

Once more, ""wif"" is mapped to ""red"" in the output sequence.

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

This repetition of the first input-output pair confirms that ""wif"" maps to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Considering these examples, the meaning of ""wif"" based on the pattern in the outputs is consistent regardless of its position in the sequence or neighboring words. Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,108,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to infer the rule that governs the meaning of the nonce word ""wif."" Here are the examples with a focus on occurrences of the word ""wif,"" and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: **wif** lug
   Output: red blue

2. Input: dax lug walm dax **wif** bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue **green red** red green

3. Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf **wif**
   Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow **red**

4. Input: dax walm **wif** walm zup
   Output: green green **green red** red red yellow

5. Input: **wif** lug
   Output: red blue

By looking at the examples, we can see that when ""wif"" is part of the input, the corresponding output is always ""red"" plus the output for ""lug,"" which is consistently ""blue.""

One possible interpretation is that ""wif"" translates to the word ""red"" in the output sequence, irrespective of its position in the input sequence. 

Another pattern to note is that the colour that follows ""red"" mirrors the word after ""wif"":

1. **wif*** lug* -> red blue
2. dax lug walm dax **wif** *bluf* dax -> green blue blue blue **red** blue red green
3. zup lug bluf zup bluf **wif** -> yellow blue blue yellow yellow **red**
4. dax walm **wif** *walm* zup -> green green **red** green red yellow

However, this second observation does not hold for the third example, where ""wif"" stands alone and there is no subsequent word, but the output is still ""red.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" with no obvious pattern to the output that follows ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,108,wif
"Given the examples, we can try to deduce a pattern for the meaning of ""wif"". In each instance, we'll look at the context in which ""wif"" appears and the corresponding output:

1. Input: wif lug | Output: red blue
2. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax | Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
3. Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif | Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
4. Input: dax walm wif walm zup | Output: green green green red red red yellow
5. Input: wif lug | Output: red blue

Let's analyze the occurrences of ""wif"" and the color that follows it:

1. In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output for ""lug"" is blue while the output for ""wif"" is red.
2. In the second example, ""wif"" is between ""dax bluf"" and ""dax,"" and the output for ""wif"" is red, with surrounding colors being green before and red after.
3. In the third example, ""wif"" comes at the end, after ""bluf zup bluf,"" with the output for ""wif"" being red again.
4. In the fourth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" and ""zup,"" and the output for ""wif"" is red, with the surrounding outputs being green before and red after.
5. In the fifth example, the context is the same as in the first, and the output is the same.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position in the input string. The surrounding words (such as ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""zup"") seem to map to other colors. ""Wif"" consistently maps to the color red in these examples.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,108,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we must look at each instance of ""wif"" and the corresponding output in these examples. By comparing the inputs and outputs, we may infer the rule(s) that the term ""wif"" follows. Here are the observations:

1. Input: wif lug | Output: red blue  
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". ""wif"" must correspond to ""red"".
   
2. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax | Output: green blue blue blue green red red green  
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"".
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the output for ""wif"" is ""red"" while ""bluf"" is ""red"" again.
   
3. Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif | Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red  
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" when it follows ""lug"" and ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"".
   - ""wif"" is at the end and corresponds to ""red"".

4. Input: dax walm wif walm zup | Output: green green green red red red yellow  
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" when following ""dax"" and ""red"" when following ""wif"".
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" which outputs ""red"", it seems to switch the color associated with ""walm"" from ""green"" to ""red"".

5. Input: wif lug | Output: red blue  
   - This is a repetition of the first example.

From these observations, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds directly to the output ""red"". However, it also seems to affect the color output of the word that follows it, changing its usual corresponding color.

Rule: wif -> red, with a potential effect of changing the following word's usual color output to red.",1.0,108,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" is associated with a particular color each time it appears. To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we should look for patterns related to when ""wif"" appears and what color is output each time. Here is a breakdown of the examples:

1. wif -> red
   - Input: wif lug
   - Output: red blue
   
2. wif -> green (1st appearance)
   - Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   - Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   
   wif -> red (2nd appearance)
   
3. wif -> yellow (3rd appearance)
   - Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
   - Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red

4. wif -> green (1st appearance)
   - Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   - Output: green green green red red red yellow
   
   wif -> red (2nd appearance)
   
5. wif -> red
   - Input: wif lug
   - Output: red blue

The pattern suggests that the meaning of ""wif"" changes depending on its position or context within the sequences. 

From the examples, ""wif"" appears to adopt the color associated with the word that precedes it. This phenomenon is observed in example (2) where ""wif"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to the color green, and ""wif"" turns green and then red after ""bluf"" which is blue. Similarly, in example (4), ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the matching color is green followed by red which is associated with ""walm."" 

We can infer that the rule for ""wif"" is that it takes on the color directly associated with the preceding word in the input sequence. When ""wif"" is the first word in the sequence as in examples (1) and (5), ""wif"" defaults to red each time.

Rule: wif -> takes the color of the preceding word; if ""wif"" is the first word, the default is red.",0.9,108,wif
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Every instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the meaning of ""zup"" in this context is the color yellow.",1.0,108,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" is a rule that assigns a specific color to certain words. The rule seems to be consistently applying the color ""yellow"" to the word ""zup.""

Therefore, the rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow

- When ""dax"" is present after ""zup,"" it gets assigned ""green.""
- When ""lug"" comes after ""zup,"" it gets assigned ""blue.""
- It's important to note that other words have consistent color assignments as well, such as ""wif"" -> red and ""walm"" -> yellow.
- The color order also seems to be determined by the sequence in which the words appear. 

So the meaning deduced from the examples is that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in this context.",1.0,108,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

This rule is derived from the consistent appearance of the word ""yellow"" in the output every time ""zup"" appears in the input. Regardless of the position of ""zup"" within the input sequence or the words that surround it, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,108,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""zup,"" let's analyze the position of ""zup"" in each input and its corresponding output:

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green
- Here, ""zup"" is followed by ""dax,"" resulting in ""yellow green.""

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red
- The sequence starts with ""zup"" followed by ""dax walm lug wif,"" and the corresponding output begins with ""yellow"" followed by a sequence of colors matching each of the words that follow ""zup.""

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue
- ""zup"" is placed before ""wif,"" then ""dax walm lug,"" and the output is ""yellow"" followed by colors that correspond to each word that follows. The order of the output aligns with the input.

Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
- ""Zup"" occurs twice after ""wif,"" and before ""lug,"" then after ""dax"" and before ""walm."" The output colors correspond in order to ""wif,"" the first ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""dax,"" the second ""zup,"" and ""walm,"" with ""yellow"" appearing both times ""zup"" is said.

Input: zup lug
Output: yellow blue
- ""Zup"" is followed by ""lug,"" resulting in ""yellow blue.""

Considering the given examples, every time ""zup"" is used, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. There is no context showing that ""zup"" means anything other than ""yellow"" based on these examples.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,108,zup
"Rule: Based on the provided examples, the word 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow'. Each appearance of 'zup' correlates to the word 'yellow' in the corresponding output.",1.0,108,zup
"Based on the information provided, the term ""bluf"" seems consistently associated with the color ""yellow"". Every example that includes ""bluf"" results in an instance of ""yellow"" in the output.

"Given the different input-output sequences, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" through pattern recognition. The outputs consist of color names that seem to correspond to each non-color word mentioned in the inputs. By examining the consistency of output colors for given words and their position, we might uncover the underlying rule.

Let's look at the data:

1. Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow.""
2. When ""bluf"" appears, it is always followed by ""yellow"" in the output, except when preceded by ""dax,"" which instead results in ""green.""
3. The word ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" in the output when it follows ""bluf.""
4. ""dax"" leads to ""green"" consistently, except when followed by ""bluf,"" which together result in ""green green.""

With these observations in mind, we can attempt to induce the rule for ""bluf."" The simplest rule that would fit these observations is:

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the same color as the word immediately preceding it (if it exists); otherwise, ""bluf"" defaults to ""yellow.""

Applying this rule to the examples:

Input: ""zup dax bluf"" 
Output: ""yellow green green"" 
Explanation: ""zup"" -> ""yellow,"" ""dax"" -> ""green,"" and since ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" ""bluf"" also -> ""green.""

Input: ""dax bluf wif lug zup""
Output: ""green green red blue yellow""

Input: ""zup bluf lug zup walm""
Output: ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
Explanation: ""zup"" -> ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" so -> ""yellow,"" ""lug"" -> ""blue,"" next ""zup"" again -> ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" not seen before but the default for an unknown word after ""zup"" appears to be ""yellow.""

Input: ""zup bluf""
Output: ""yellow yellow""
Explanation: ""zup"" -> ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" so -> ""yellow.""

With this rule, the meaning of ""bluf"" can be deduced as:

bluf -> Takes the color of the word immediately before it; if there is no word before it or the word before it has not been assigned a specific color, then ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" by default.",0.8,108,bluf
"From the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""walm"" by examining the context in which it appears and the corresponding output colors. By looking for patterns in the data, we can attempt to induce the underlying rule.

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Let us examine each unique word and their associated output colors:
- ""wif"" seems to be consistently associated with the color red.
- ""lug"" seems to be consistently associated with the color blue.
- ""dax"" seems to be consistently associated with the color green.
- ""zup"" seems to be consistently associated with the color yellow.

Now, let's look at ""walm"" and the colors that follow it:
- After ""dax walm,"" we see ""green green green,"" which suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word.
- After ""wif walm,"" we see ""red red red,"" reinforcing the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word.

We can now apply this logic to the other examples to verify:
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" correlates to ""red red green green green,"" which makes sense if ""walm"" repeats the color green associated with ""dax.""
- ""lug walm wif zup wif"" gives us ""blue blue blue red yellow red,"" and here, ""walm"" repeats the color blue associated with ""lug.""

Given this consistent pattern across all examples, the rule we can induce is that ""walm"" causes the output of the color associated with the previously mentioned word to be repeated.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,108,walm
"Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word. 

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and when ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" the output is ""red red"" meaning ""walm"" repeats the color red.

- In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" repeats this color, outputting ""blue blue.""

- In the third example, again ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" repeats the blue color, resulting in ""blue blue.""

- In the fourth example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" continues the sequence with additional greens.

- In the last example, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" once again repeats the red color, leading to ""red red red.""

Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

Here, ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"" and is followed by ""blue"" twice more. ""Wif"" is ""red"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow"" after ""walm"".

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow

Once again, ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""walm"" appears to continue that color with two more ""blue"", and ""zup"" is ""yellow"".

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Here ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"", and the output is three ""green"". 

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

In this final example, ""wif"" is again ""red"", and ""walm"" continues the ""red"" before ""dax"" which is ""green"" and ""zup"" which is ""yellow"".

From these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it two additional times. One more check we can make is to see if the surrounding words confirm to this rule:

- ""wif"" is consistently red.
- ""lug"" is consistently blue.
- ""dax"" is consistently green.
- ""zup"" is consistently yellow.

These observations confirm that our rule for ""walm"" seems consistent across all examples.

2. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red.""
3. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""

Given these observations, it seems that ""walm"" serves as a repeater or multiplier for the color associated with the word that precedes it, specifically repeating the color three times. It does not have a color meaning by itself but rather amplifies the preceding color word.

Rule: walm -> When the word ""walm"" follows another word, the output is the color corresponding to that word repeated three times.",1.0,108,walm
"Let's examine each example and deduce the repeated pattern:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in two additional ""green""s.

2. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   ""Walm"" is followed by ""wif"" and between them, there's an extra ""blue"".

3. Input: lug walm zup
   Output: blue blue blue yellow
   Again, after ""walm"" we see an extra ""blue"".

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   We see ""walm"" follow ""dax"" and produce an extra ""green"".

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   ""Walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""dax."" It adds an extra ""red"" before ""dax"".

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. It does not add a new color, but rather causes a repetition or continuation of the output color that would be assigned to the preceding word.

- ""zup"" consistently results in ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" correlates with the output ""green"" in every instance it appears.

Based on this pattern, the rule appears to be a straightforward mapping of nonce words to color names in the output.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,109,dax

"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the given examples.",1.0,109,dax
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,109,wif
"Based on the examples given, ""wif"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""red."" Each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the output. No other word in the examples given produces the color ""red.""

Here is the explanation according to the examples:

- Input: wif zup; Output: red yellow — ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- Input: dax wif bluf; Output: green red red — ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- Input: wif zup; Output: red yellow — ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- Input: wif dax zup bluf; Output: red green yellow yellow — ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- Input: zup bluf wif walm; Output: yellow yellow red red red — ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Given this consistent pattern, the rule we can induce is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,109,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's break down each example to see how the inputs match the outputs:

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow
Analysis: ""wif"" comes first and is translated as ""red""; ""zup"" follows and is translated as ""yellow"".

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red
Analysis: ""dax"" translates to ""green""; ""wif"" translates to ""red""; and ""bluf"" seems to also translate to ""red"".

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow
Analysis: This is a repetition of the first example, confirming ""wif"" as ""red"" and ""zup"" as ""yellow"".

Input: wif dax zup bluf
Output: red green yellow yellow
Analysis: ""wif"" translates to ""red""; ""dax"" as ""green""; ""zup"" as ""yellow"". Here, ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" instead of ""red"" as in the second example. This suggests that ""bluf"" might change its translation based on its position or surrounding words.

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
Analysis: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""; ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" again when preceding ""wif""; ""wif"" translates to ""red"", followed by ""walm"". ""walm"" does not have a preceding word to compare to but produces ""red red"", suggesting it could add an extra ""red"".

Given these observations, the meaning of ""wif"" is consistent across all examples. Regardless of its position or surrounding words, ""wif"" always translates to ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,109,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following color associations for each word:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- bluf -> red
- wif -> red

Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. Thus, it suggests that ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,109,wif
"To identify the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's examine the output associated with each input. 

Each input contains ""wif"" and leads to an output pattern where ""wif"" is eventually followed by the sequence ""red."" Moreover, we can observe that the color sequence after ""red"" seems to reflect the number of letters in the word that comes after ""wif."" 

Let's analyze:

1. ""wif zup"" leads to ""red yellow."" The word ""zup"" has three letters, and the color ""yellow"" appears once after ""red.""
2. ""dax wif bluf"" gives us ""green red red red."" The word ""bluf"" has four letters, resulting in a repetition of the word ""red"" three times.
3. ""wif zup"" again results in ""red yellow,"" showing consistency with the previous association of ""zup"" with ""yellow.""
4. ""wif dax zup bluf"" leads to ""red green yellow yellow."" After ""red,"" the first color is ""green,"" which corresponds with the word ""dax"" (three letters). The sequence ""yellow yellow"" follows, which coincides with ""zup bluf,"" where ""zup"" is three letters and ""bluf"" is four.
5. ""zup bluf wif walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow red red red."" After the sequence ""yellow yellow"" (which corresponds to ""zup bluf"" as before), we get ""red red red."" Since ""walm"" has four letters and ""wif"" supposedly produces ""red,"" this sequence suggests that the rule for ""wif"" involves generating ""red"" plus a number of ""red"" repeats corresponding to the number of letters in the following word minus one.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to an output of ""red,"" followed by additional ""red"" outputs equivalent to the length of the word that comes after ""wif"" minus one.

Expressed concisely as:

wif -> meaning: Output ""red,"" followed by a number of ""red"" equal to the number of letters in the following word, minus one.",0.8,109,wif

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow."" Conversely, the words ""bluf"" and ""lug"" translate to ""blue"" and ""walm"" seems to translate to ""yellow"" as well.

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, it is translated to ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,109,zup
"Based on these examples, each input word correlates to a specific color in the output:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

When the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output color is the same as the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" If ""bluf"" is the first word or follows a word that has not been assigned a specific color, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color yellow (as seen in the second example: ""zup bluf"" produces ""yellow yellow""). 

Therefore, we induce the rule that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word, with a default of yellow when it is the first word or follows an unknown color assignment.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word, defaulting to yellow if it is the first word or follows an unassigned word.",1.0,109,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" has no direct translation but results in ""green"" when following ""wif""

Given that ""bluf"" produces the same color as the word before it:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red red.""
- In the second example, it follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- In the third example, it follows ""zup"" and comes before ""wif,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow red.""
- In the fourth example, it comes after ""wif"" and before ""lug,"" resulting in ""red red blue.""

Hence, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word.

"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" translates to the color appearing immediately before it in the sequence.

1. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red

"Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word that follows it twice.

Explanation: When examining the input-output pairs given in the examples:

- In the first example (""lug bluf dax bluf""), the output is ""blue blue green green"". Here bluf is followed by the words ""dax"" and ""lug"", which correspond to green and blue, respectively, both colors are repeated twice each time bluf is used.

- In the second example (""dax walm wif bluf""), the output is ""green green green red red"". This supports the rule because bluf is at the end and repeats the color red which corresponds to the word ""wif"" that came before it twice.

- The third example (""dax bluf wif zup wif"") further confirms this rule, as the output ""green green red yellow red"" shows that bluf, following the first ""dax"", resulted in ""green green"".

- The fourth example (""zup bluf"") also supports this with the output ""yellow yellow"", where bluf repeats the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.

- The fifth example (""zup bluf wif lug dax"") confirms the rule again with the output ""yellow yellow red blue green"", bluf follows ""zup"" and repeats the color yellow twice.

So, the meaning of bluf is that it repeats the color of the word that follows it, and if it is the last word, it repeats the color of the word that preceded it twice.

"Walm -> repeats the color associated with the word that comes before it thrice.

Rule: Whenever the word 'walm' is used in a sequence, it causes the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding 'walm' to be repeated three times in the output. 

- In ""lug walm,"" 'lug' corresponds to blue, so 'walm' leads to ""blue blue blue.""

- In ""dax walm zup,"" 'dax' makes 'walm' ""green green green,"" followed by 'zup' which corresponds to yellow.
- In ""dax walm,"" 'dax' leads 'walm' to be ""green green green.""
- In ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" we see 'lug' is blue, 'bluf' is blue, 'wif' is red, and thus when 'walm' follows the second instance of 'wif,' it is ""red red red,"" and finally, 'lug' is blue.",1.0,110,walm

In 'lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,' ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which translates to red), and as ""walm"" appears for the first time in the sequence, it repeats ""red"" three times.

"walm -> repetition of the color associated with the word before it three times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears in an input sequence, the output should repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times. For instance:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, so ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"".",1.0,110,walm
"Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before walm, three times.

In each example, the word that precedes ""walm"" determines the color to be repeated three times. ""Lug"" correlates with ""blue"" and ""dax"" correlates with ""green"". When ""walm"" is encountered, the color related to the previous word is outputted thrice. For instance:

- ""lug walm"": ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", thus ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".
- ""lug walm dax"": After ""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue"", the new word ""dax"" adds ""green"".
- ""dax walm zup"": ""dax"" leads to ""green"", so ""walm"" gives ""green green green"" followed by ""zup"" which gives ""yellow"".
- ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"": The sequence contains multiple colors with ""walm"" following ""wif"". However, since ""walm"" is placed after ""wif"" and no specific color has been associated with ""wif"" (it results in ""red"" on its own), the rule seems to break down here. Given that the second last word is ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"", the output before ""walm"" (following ""wif"") is ""blue blue blue"". But, considering ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" directly, it implies a potential exception to the proposed rule, or an undefined case where ""walm"" follows a word without a clear color association (""wif""). In such a case, the output pattern isn’t consistent with the rule identified.

Therefore, based on the majority of examples, the rule seems to be repeating the color of the word right before ""walm"" but the last example introduces a discrepancy that cannot be resolved with the given information. The most consistent interpretation for the first four examples is:

3. The sequence ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" gives us multiple color outputs, with the word ""lug"" still corresponding to ""blue.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,111,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that surround it, ""wif"" always has the same translation. Here are the conclusions drawn from each example:

- In ""dax wif,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In ""wif lug,"" ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In ""wif"" by itself, the output is ""red,"" confirming that ""wif"" alone translates to ""red.""
- In ""dax bluf wif zup,"" the word ""wif"" is translated as ""red,"" with ""dax"" as ""green,"" ""bluf"" as ""green,"" and ""zup"" as ""yellow.""
- In ""zup wif bluf zup lug,"" ""wif"" remains constant as ""red,"" with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,111,wif
wif -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: wif corresponds to the color red.,1.0,111,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"", irrespective of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.",1.0,111,wif
"Based on the inputs and outputs given, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" An additional pattern emerges when looking at other nonce words such as ""dax"" and ""zup,"" which translate respectively to ""green"" and ""yellow.""

Here is the rule induction based on the examples:

- ""wif"" always results in the color ""red.""
- ""dax"" always results in the color ""green.""
- ""bluf"" always results in the color ""green.""
- ""zup"" always results in the color ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" always results in the color ""blue.""

Thus, we can say:

wif -> red

This rule holds true regardless of the position of the word ""wif"" in the input sentence or its surrounding context.",1.0,111,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in every given example.",1.0,111,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Given the examples, we observe that every time 'zup' is mentioned, the output includes the color 'yellow'. Hence, 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow' in the output.",1.0,111,zup
"The examples provided suggest that ""zup"" stands for a specific color output, regardless of context. In each instance where ""zup"" is present, the output includes ""yellow"". Therefore, based on the examples, the rule seems fairly straightforward:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,111,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow (The word zup consistently translates to the color yellow in all given examples.),1.0,111,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""zup"" is consistently associated with the output ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Thus, we can deduce:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,111,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the color patterns associated with the other words that repeat in the examples:

- ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green.""
- ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue.""

Now, observe the positions of ""bluf"" and the corresponding color outputs:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" gives ""yellow."" There's nothing to directly compare it with.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" results in two instances of ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" gives two instances of ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

From these observations, it is clear that ""bluf"" does not have a consistent color output. The color it represents changes in each example. However, we can notice a pattern: the color output for ""bluf"" is determined by the word that immediately precedes it:

- In the second example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and ""dax,"" and the output is ""red"" and ""green,"" respectively.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and results in ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and results in ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can deduce a rule:

bluf -> The color represented by the word that comes immediately before ""bluf.""

Rule: If a word A precedes ""bluf,"" then the output color for ""bluf"" will be the same as the output color for word A.",1.0,111,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the pattern for the word ""bluf"" and what it might mean. Let's analyze the correlation:

1. Input: dax zup bluf | Output: green yellow yellow
2. Input: wif bluf dax walm | Output: red red green green green
3. Input: dax zup lug bluf | Output: green yellow blue blue
4. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug | Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
5. Input: zup bluf dax lug | Output: yellow yellow green blue

Now let's examine each instance:

- In examples 1, 2, and 5, ""bluf"" follows a set of two distinct words (""dax zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup"" respectively), and the output for ""bluf"" is the same color as the word that directly precedes it.
- However, in examples 3 and 4, ""bluf"" follows a series of three words, where the second and third words are the same (""zup lug lug"" and ""lug zup lug""), and the output for ""bluf"" is different, matching the second word (""lug"") in the sequence.
  
Based on these observations, we can derive a rule for the nonce word ""bluf"": it repeats the color of the word occurring directly before it, unless this word is identical to the word occurring before the preceding word, in which case ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word two places before it.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word; if the previous word is the same as the one before it, then bluf repeats the color of the word two places before.",0.8,111,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the relationship between the input and the output for each example:

1. Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow
   - We can't derive the meaning of ""bluf"" yet since there's no pattern to compare with. ""dax"" correlates with ""green"", ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"".

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green
   - ""wif"" correlates with ""red"", ""dax"" still correlates with ""green"". ""bluf"" being in the second position correlates with ""red"", just like ""wif"".

3. Input: dax zup lug bluf -> Output: green yellow blue blue
   - ""dax"" is ""green"" again, ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""lug"" being new correlates with ""blue"". Since ""bluf"" is the last word and the last color is blue, just like ""lug"", this trend might suggest ""bluf"" means the color of the word before it.

4. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   - Here, ""bluf"" follows a ""zup"" and corresponds to ""yellow"", supporting the idea that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it; in this case, ""zup"" which is associated with ""yellow"".

5. Input: zup bluf dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow green blue
   - ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" which is ""yellow"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""yellow"", further supporting the rule.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Takes the color associated with the word immediately before it in the sequence. If the word before ""bluf"" is ""zup"", then ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""; if it's ""dax"", then ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""; if it's ""lug"", then ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"", and so on.",0.8,111,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's correlate the inputs with their respective outputs to see if we can find a pattern. We can begin by looking for instances where the word ""bluf"" appears and what color is associated with it in the output.


Input: dax zup bluf Output: green yellow yellow
- bluf is associated with yellow here. Since we don't know what ""dax"" or ""zup"" means, we can't yet draw a conclusion.


Input: wif bluf dax walm Output: red red green green green
- bluf is associated with red here. This conflicts with the previous example, so the color may not be directly associated with ""bluf."" However, ""dax"" was followed by green in the first and second examples.


Input: dax zup lug bluf Output: green yellow blue blue
- bluf is associated with blue here. This adds another layer of confusion if we were to assume ""bluf"" translates directly to a color.


Input: zup lug zup bluf lug Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
- bluf is associated with yellow again here, which would seem to match the first example. However, with the third example differing, it is not consistent.


Input: zup bluf dax lug Output: yellow yellow green blue
- bluf is associated with yellow one more time.

From these examples, we can see that ""bluf"" is not consistently associated with any single color, which suggests its meaning might depend on context. However, we do notice that ""bluf"" most frequently correlates with the color yellow, except in the second and third examples.

One possible rule could be that ""bluf"" correlates to the color of the noun that follows it. To validate this, we can check:

- In the first case, there isn't a word after ""bluf"", but ""zup"" precedes it and maps to yellow.
- In the second case, ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" and the next color is green.
- In the third case, there is no word after ""bluf"", but ""lug"" precedes it and maps to blue.
- In the fourth case, ""lug"" follows ""bluf"" and the next color is blue.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" and the next color is green.

So the potential rule is that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the noun immediately following it. If there is no following noun, it takes the color value of the preceding noun. Let's express this as the rule:

Rule: bluf -> Takes on the color associated with the next word in the sequence. If there is no word after it, it takes the color of the previous word.",0.6,111,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" correlates to the color ""yellow."" Each occurrence of ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. In the cases where ""bluf"" appears, no other factors are changing the corresponding output color. Therefore:

Rule: bluf -> yellow.",0.0,111,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can analyze the common patterns present in each example provided.

1. In ""zup wif walm,"" the word ""walm"" correlates to a repetition of ""red"" three times.
2. In ""lug wif zup wif walm,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and again ""walm"" adds two extra ""red"" after the first ""red"" that follows it.
3. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" also has ""walm"" followed by the three repetitions of the color preceding it, that is ""green,"" and then continues with the colors associated with ""lug"" and ""wif.""
4. ""lug walm"" sees ""walm"" causing ""blue"" to be repeated three times.
5. Finally, in ""dax zup dax walm,"" ""walm"" once again causes the repetition of ""green"" three times after the color pattern associated with the other words (""dax"" for ""green,"" ""zup"" for ""yellow"").

From the examples, ""walm"" seems to cause the immediate preceding color to repeat three times. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be understood as repeating the previous color word output three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.",1.0,111,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the examples provided.

Let's first lay out what a possible mapping for the words could be:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

Now, let's consider the appearances of ""walm"" considering the possible mappings:

1. ""zup wif walm"" outputs ""yellow red red red."" Since we have ""zup"" -> ""yellow"" and ""wif"" -> ""red,"" it is possible that ""walm"" contributes another ""red.""

2. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" gives ""blue red yellow red red red."" We note ""lug"" -> ""blue,"" and it is followed by ""red"" from ""wif,"" ""yellow"" from ""zup,"" and another ""red"" from the next ""wif."" It's likely that ""walm"" is contributing two more ""red.""

3. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" shows ""yellow green green green blue red."" Here, we see ""zup"" -> ""yellow,"" ""dax"" -> ""green,"" ""lug"" -> ""blue,"" and ""wif"" -> ""red."" The three ""green""s might suggest that ""walm"" adds two more ""green"" to the sequence.

4. ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" Here, it seems like ""walm"" adds two more ""blue"" given that ""lug"" is ""blue.""

5. ""dax zup dax walm"" corresponds to ""green yellow green green green."" Given the earlier mappings, ""dax"" -> ""green"" and ""zup"" -> ""yellow,"" ""walm"" in this case appears to add two additional ""green"" following the pattern set by ""dax.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it twice. Therefore, ""walm"" appears to be a function that duplicates the color output of the prior word two more times. If ""walm"" occurs without a preceding color word, it may not produce an output or the pattern is not clear from the examples given.

Rule: walm -> Takes the color output of the word immediately before it and repeats it twice. If there is no color word immediately before it, the rule cannot be determined from the given examples.",0.9,111,walm
"Based on the given examples:

1. When 'walm' appears alone after another word, it seems to produce three repetitions of that word's corresponding color in the output.

2. When 'walm' follows the sequence 'zup wif', it adds additional 'red' to the output sequence after 'yellow red'.

Now to test the first observation,

- In ""lug walm"", 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', followed by 'walm' there are three 'blue's in a row in the output. This fits the first rule.

- However, in ""zup wif walm"", besides the three 'red's, there is an additional 'red' which doesn't seem to fit the first rule directly. It could be because 'wif' has a special modifying rule when it comes before 'walm', adding an additional 'red'.

- In ""lug wif zup wif walm"", 'lug' is 'blue', 'zup' is 'yellow', and 'wif' again seems to have the effect of adding an additional 'red' before the three 'red's due to 'walm'.

- In ""zup dax walm lug wif"", 'zup' is 'yellow', and 'dax' is 'green'. After 'walm', we see three 'green's. Then 'lug wif' follows, which is 'blue red', although it shouldn't directly impact our interpretation of 'walm'.

- In ""dax zup dax walm"", 'dax' is 'green', 'zup' is 'yellow'. Following 'walm', we find three instances of 'green', consistent with the first observation if 'walm' repeats the last color-mentioned word.

Therefore, it seems that 'walm' includes a repetition factor, but can also be modified by certain preceding words, like 'wif'. With the information provided, the most evident pattern is that 'walm' generates three repetitions of the color associated with the immediately preceding word, with a potential modification when preceded by 'wif'.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times (except when modified by 'wif', which needs more examples to establish a clear rule).",0.8,111,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns and how they relate to the outputs:

1. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
2. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" -> ""blue red yellow red red red""
3. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" -> ""yellow green green green blue red""
4. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
5. ""dax zup dax walm"" -> ""green yellow green green green""

From the above examples, we notice that the appearance of ""walm"" in the inputs correlates with a series of the same colors in the output. The number of repeated colors corresponds to the total number of words that precede ""walm"". 

Let's verify the rule with the given examples:

1. One word (""wif"") precedes ""walm"" (red is repeated once).
2. Three words (""lug wif zup"") precede ""walm"" (red is repeated thrice).
3. Four words (""zup dax lug wif"") precede ""walm"" (green is repeated four times after yellow and before blue red).
4. One word (""lug"") precedes ""walm"" (blue is repeated once).
5. Three words (""dax zup dax"") precede ""walm"" (green is repeated thrice).

Therefore, it seems that the rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" a number of times equal to the total count of words prior to ""walm"" in the sequence.

Let's consolidate this into a rule:
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" for as many times as there are total words that precede ""walm"".",0.8,111,walm
"To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns before and after the nonce word in each given example. Let's look at the color patterns and their potential relationships with the words.

- ""zup wif walm"" maps to ""yellow red red red."" We see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and there are three repetitions of ""red"" that follow ""walm.""
- In ""lug wif zup wif walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" After ""walm,"" we have four repetitions of ""red.""
- ""zup dax walm lug wif"" gives us ""yellow green green green blue red."" Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" There are three repetitions of ""green"" before a ""blue red"" occurs, suggesting a possible link between ""walm"" and the subsequent colors, but we only have one red subsequent to ""walm"" amidst other colors.
- ""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" is ""blue."" Following ""walm,"" there are two additional repetitions of ""blue.""
- Finally, ""dax zup dax walm"" becomes ""green yellow green green green,"" where ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and after ""walm"" we have three repetitions of ""green.""

A pattern emerges where ""walm"" results in a series of a color that comes after it. The repetition seems to be linked to the color directly following the word ""walm."" 

Rule:
- walm -> causes a repetition of the color word that follows

If we apply this rule, let's verify it against each input:

1. ""zup wif walm"" outputs one ""yellow"" from ""zup,"" and then three ""red"" from ""wif,"" repeated because of ""walm.""
2. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" outputs ""blue"" from ""lug,"" one yellow from ""zup,"" and then four ""red"" from the double appearance of ""wif"" which indicates an additional ""red"" before repeating because of ""walm.""
3. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" does not follow the sequence perfectly since ""lug wif"" breaks the repetition of the color. However, since ""lug wif"" at the end is consistent across examples, the three ""green"" from ""dax"" before ""lug wif"" still supports the rule.
4. ""lug walm"" gives us ""blue blue blue,"" supporting the rule since the ""blue"" from ""lug"" is repeated due to ""walm.""
5. ""dax zup dax walm"" gives us one ""yellow"" from ""zup,"" and then three ""green"" from ""dax,"" repeated because of ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule seems valid with the exception of the inconsistent example 3. It's possible there's an exception or different rule in play for that sequence, or it could be an error. However, the fundamental rule extracted for ""walm"" causing repetition holds for the other examples.",0.8,111,walm

"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in the output.",1.0,112,lug
"Based on the provided examples, we are attempting to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax."" Let's analyze the color outputs corresponding to the word ""dax"" in each instance:

1. ""dax walm zup"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow""
2. ""lug walm dax"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue green""
3. ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" corresponds to ""green red green yellow yellow""
4. ""dax walm zup lug dax"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow blue green""
5. ""dax zup dax zup"" corresponds to ""green yellow green yellow""

Consistency between the inputs and outputs shows that whenever ""dax"" appears, it corresponds to the output ""green."" Let's confirm this by checking where ""green"" appears in the output and what word is present in the corresponding position in the input:

- In the first example, ""dax"" is at the beginning and corresponds to ""green.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" is at the end and also corresponds to ""green.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" appears twice, both times corresponding to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" appears at the beginning and end, and in both cases, it corresponds to ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" appears twice, separated by ""zup,"" and each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

These instances give a consistent rule that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule is: dax -> green",1.0,112,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" according to the pattern of colors in the output:

- In examples where ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" is present in the output at the same position where ""dax"" appears in the input.
- The word ""dax"" always results in the color ""green"" in the output regardless of its position in the input.

From these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,112,dax
"Based on the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, we need to determine the rule(s) that link the nonce word ""dax"" to the color in the output. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: dax walm zup | Output: green green green yellow
2. Input: lug walm dax | Output: blue blue blue green
3. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf | Output: green red green yellow yellow
4. Input: dax walm zup lug dax | Output: green green green yellow blue green
5. Input: dax zup dax zup | Output: green yellow green yellow

There is a consistent pattern where every instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. The other words (""walm,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf"") correlate to other colors (""green,"" ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""red,"" ""yellow""), but we are tasked with determining the meaning of ""dax"" specifically.

Rule:
dax -> green",1.0,112,dax
"Observing the pattern in the inputs and outputs, it seems that the appearance of the nonce word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green"" in the output. It is not dependent on its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green. ""Dax"" corresponds to the color green.",1.0,112,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the examples and the respective outputs. It seems that the outputs consist of color words, and each color corresponds to a word in the input.

From the first and second examples, we can see that ""dax"" does not correspond to a single color but to different ones (""green"" in the first example and ""green"" again in the second example, but in a different position). However, we can possibly infer that ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" as they match in both examples.

If we look closely, ""dax"" is present multiple times within a single example and is consistent within that example. In the third example, both instances of ""dax"" correspond to ""green."" Similarly, in the fifth example, ""dax"" also corresponds to ""green"" in both positions it appears in.

Observing all examples, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""

The only word that changes colors is ""dax."" Our task is to find out under which rule this change happens. The rule for ""dax"" seems to be dependent on its position within the input sequence since it is the only variable that changes across examples. The examples seem to indicate that ""dax"" represents ""green"" when it is in the first, third, or fifth position (which are odd positions) in the sequence. 

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when it is in an odd position within the sequence. If in the second or fourth position (or any even position), however, its color changes, as evidenced in the second example where it's green in the third position, and the fourth example where it's blue in the fourth position.

The examples are not sufficient to deduce what color ""dax"" represents in even positions consistently, as it is seen as green once and blue in another instance. More data would be needed to determine the rule for even positions precisely. However, based on the given examples, the deduced rule is:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when it is in an odd position within the input sequence; its color in other positions is inconsistent with given examples and cannot be determined without further information.",0.7,112,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each time the word ""wif"" appears, it is associated with the color ""red."" The color following ""wif"" varies according to the word that comes after wif. 

Here are the patterns associated with the other words:

- ""dax"" seems to be associated with the color ""green.""
- ""lug"" appears to be associated with the color ""blue.""
- ""walm"" is slightly more complex: when it immediately follows ""wif,"" it seems to result in multiple ""red"" outputs, but when not immediately following ""wif,"" it translates to ""yellow.""
- ""zup"" does not immediately follow ""wif"" in any example, but based on the second and third examples, it seems to be consistently associated with ""yellow.""

The 'wif' rule seems to act as a trigger for the start of the color sequence and ensures the first color is always ""red."" Additionally, 'wif' might also indicate repetition of the color ""red"" when a specific word follows it, such as ""walm,"" although more examples would be useful to confirm this pattern.

Here is the deduced rule for ""wif"":

Rule: wif -> The word ""wif"" prompts the color sequence to start with ""red"" and affects the occurrence of subsequent colors depending on the words following it.",1.0,112,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Each instance of ""wif"" is followed by the word ""red"" in the output, regardless of the context or the other words that appear with it.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,112,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we can look at the patterns present in the given examples. In every sequence, the presence of ""wif"" produces the output ""red."" This is consistent regardless of the other words around it. Therefore, ""wif"" seems to consistently correspond to the output ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,112,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" let's analyze the patterns from the examples given:

1. In every example, regardless of the other words, when ""wif"" is present, the output always begins with ""red.""
2. ""Wif"" seems to always be the first word in the input and, correspondingly, ""red"" is always the first color in the output.
3. There is no instance where ""wif"" comes with any other output than ""red,"" regardless of what follows it.

Based on these observations, the deduced meaning of ""wif"" within the provided examples is that it translates or corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Therefore, when ""wif"" is an input, it will result in ""red"" being the output.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,112,wif
"Based on the given examples, the presence of the word 'wif' appears to be correlated with the output starting with the color 'red'. The number of times 'red' appears in the output seems to be influenced by the repetition of the word 'walm' that follows 'wif'.

Looking at the patterns:

- Every input that includes just 'wif' without any other words has an output of 'red'.
- When 'wif' is followed by 'dax', the output is 'red green'.
- When 'wif' is followed by 'walm', the word 'red' is repeated as many times as 'walm' is immediately repeated after 'wif'.
- The word 'lug' in the input corresponds to 'blue' in the output.
- The word 'zup' in the input corresponds to 'yellow' in the output.
- The word 'dax' in the input corresponds to 'green' in the output.

Assuming that the word 'wif' dictates that 'red' should be the first color in the output and potentially repeating depending on the context (specifically the repetition of 'walm'), but is not directly associated with 'dax,' 'lug,' or 'zup', the likely rule for 'wif' is:

Rule: wif indicates that the output should start with the word 'red'. If 'walm' repeats immediately after 'wif', 'red' is output as many times as 'walm' is repeated.",0.9,112,wif

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. Therefore, the rule can be concluded as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,112,zup
"Rule: The pseudo-word ""bluf"" corresponds to a repetition of the color that is indicated by the word immediately preceding it. The color is repeated once if ""bluf"" comes after a single color word, or the color is repeated as many times as that single color word appeared consecutively before ""bluf"".

Examples broken down:

- Input: zup bluf wif walm
  - zup -> yellow
  - bluf -> repeats the color yellow (as zup indicates yellow and is right before bluf)
  - wif -> red
  - walm -> red 
  Output: yellow yellow red red red
  
- Input: lug bluf wif
  - lug -> blue
  - bluf -> repeats the color blue (as lug indicates blue and is right before bluf)
  - wif -> red

- Input: wif walm lug bluf
  - wif -> red

  - lug -> blue
  - bluf -> repeats the color blue (as lug indicates blue and is right before bluf)
  - wif -> red again
  - zup -> yellow
  Output: red blue blue red yellow

bluf -> repetition of the color indicated by the immediately preceding word.",1.0,112,bluf
"Analyzing the given examples:

1. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
2. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red
3. wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue
4. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
5. wif lug bluf wif zup -> red blue blue red yellow

It seems that ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. A color word is provided for each non-color word (zup -> yellow, lug -> blue, wif -> red, dax -> green), and when ""bluf"" follows any of these words, the corresponding color is repeated once.

So, for example, in ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""bluf"" leads to an additional yellow being output as well. This pattern is consistent across all given examples.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,112,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" dictates that the color following it should be repeated once, and the color term is directly associated with a color output. Here, we note that the color terms ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif"" correspond to the colors ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" and ""red,"" respectively. The term ""walm"" is also used, corresponding to the color ""red.""

Let's break down each input and output to decipher the rule:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Analysis: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"". Since ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" and the output is ""yellow yellow red red red,"" ""bluf"" causes ""red"" to be repeated once.

2. Input: lug bluf wif
   Output: blue blue red
   Analysis: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". ""bluf"" is between them, and ""blue"" is repeated once before ""red.""

3. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   Analysis: The pattern is consistent here with the previous findings. ""Lug"" is ""blue"" and it is repeated once after ""bluf.""

4. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green
   Analysis: ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is likely ""green,"" and after ""bluf,"" ""green"" is repeated.

5. Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
   Output: red blue blue red yellow
   Analysis: ""Wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow."" ""Bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" (which is ""red""), but we see ""blue blue,"" indicating ""bluf"" enforces the repetition of the color immediately preceding it rather than following it.

Based on the analysis, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" causes the color immediately preceding it to be repeated once.

Rule: bluf -> Causes the immediately preceding color word to be repeated in the output.",1.0,112,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" indicates that the color corresponding to the previous word should be repeated once more after its initial output. If ""bluf"" is the first word, or if its position in the sequence does not follow a color-indicating word, it defaults to adding the color ""green"" instead.

So, based on the patterns observed in the examples:

- ""zup,"" when followed by ""bluf,"" yields ""yellow"" twice.
- ""lug,"" when followed by ""bluf,"" yields ""blue"" twice.
- ""wif,"" when followed by ""bluf,"" yields ""red"" twice.
- ""bluf"" following ""dax"" yields ""green"" twice, suggesting that ""dax"" has no assigned color and defaults to ""green.""

Therefore, bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word or default to ""green"" if no color-associated word precedes it.",1.0,112,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to be directly associated with a sequence of colors, specifically repeating the colors previously mentioned, according to the number of syllables in ""bluf"", which is two. In each output, the color(s) that appear before ""bluf"" in the input are repeated twice.

Examples for analysis:

1. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
   Before ""bluf"" we have ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow"". After ""bluf"" comes ""wif"" which is ""red"" and it's followed by ""walm"", which is also ""red"".

2. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red
   Before ""bluf"" we have ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue"". After ""bluf"" comes ""wif"" which is ""red"".

3. wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue
   Before ""bluf"" we have ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue"", and the sequence ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red"".

4. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
   Before ""bluf"" we have ""dax,"" which translates to ""green"". ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and it's not repeated because it comes before ""dax"".

5. wif lug bluf wif zup -> red blue blue red yellow
   Before ""bluf"" we have ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue"". It's followed by ""wif"" which is ""red"" which is not repeated because it comes after ""bluf"". ""zup"" at the end translates to ""yellow"".

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color(s) mentioned before it twice.",0.8,112,bluf
"walm -> repetition of the previous color three times.

Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates that the color word immediately preceding it should be repeated three times. 

- In ""dax walm"" (green green green), ""walm"" causes ""dax"" (green) to repeat three times.
- In ""zup walm"" (yellow yellow yellow), ""walm"" causes ""zup"" (yellow) to repeat three times.
- In ""lug walm"" (blue blue blue), ""walm"" causes ""lug"" (blue) to repeat three times.
- When ""walm"" is used twice as in ""dax walm wif walm"" (green green green red red red), the pattern follows for both instances, causing ""dax"" (green) and then ""wif"" (red) to repeat three times each.",1.0,112,walm
"According to the examples provided, each instance of the nonce word ""walm"" generates an output of a color repeated three times. There seems to be a rule that ties a specific color to each unique word that precedes the word ""walm."" 

Here's the pattern observed for each word preceding ""walm"":
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""

Thus, we can infer that ""walm"" serves as an indicator for a color to be outputted in triplicate. It seems to inherit its specific color from the word that comes immediately before it. The word itself does not define a specific color but rather relies on the context provided by the preceding word to determine the color output.

Therefore, the rule appears to be: when you see ""walm,"" output the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,112,walm
"The examples suggest that ""walm"" triggers a repeat of the color associated with the previous word three times. Let's examine the patterns:

1. ""dax walm wif"" yields ""green green green red"". Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" which is then repeated three times due to ""walm"", followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red"".

2. ""zup walm"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow"". In this case, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is repeated three times due to ""walm"".

3. ""dax walm wif walm"" results in ""green green green red red red"". This is consistent with the above rule; ""walm"" makes ""green"" (from ""dax"") repeat three times, and then ""red"" (from ""wif"") is also repeated three times due to the second ""walm"".

4. ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue"". This indicates that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" which is repeated three times after ""walm"".

5. ""zup walm dax lug"" generates ""yellow yellow yellow green blue"". ""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" followed by ""walm"" which multiplies it by three. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue""; no additional repetition because ""walm"" is not used after them.

From these examples, we can infer the rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,112,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output to be a series of colors repeated three times. The specific color appears to be determined by the word that precedes ""walm."" Here's how the word before ""walm"" corresponds to a color:

- ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and results in ""yellow yellow yellow""

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's identify patterns related to the word in the different inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

Observations:
1. When ""dax"" is present, the output is ""green green green,"" and ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" which then leads to the output of ""red"".
2. When ""zup"" is present, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" followed by ""walm"" without any additional words leading to the output or change of color.
3. When ""lug"" is present, the output is ""blue blue blue,"" and ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" which doesn’t lead to any additional output or change of color.
4. In the input with both ""zup"" and ""dax"" before ""lug,"" and ""walm"" only after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"" for ""zup walm"" and ""green"" for ""dax"" followed by ""blue"" for ""lug,"" with ""walm"" not repeating after ""dax"" and ""lug.""

It appears that ""walm"" causes the color word to repeat three times based on the word that precedes it. However, if ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" specifically, the output is ""red"" and it repeats depending on the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned after ""dax.""

Rule:
walm -> meaning:
- When following ""zup"" or ""lug,"" repeat the associated color three times.
- When following ""dax,"" produce ""red"" and repeat it for as many times as ""walm"" appears after ""dax.""",0.8,112,walm

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.",1.0,113,lug
"Based on the given examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" appears to be categorical and not dependent on the position or context within a sequence of words.

"Observing the provided examples, each instance of the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Other words correspond to different colors, but no matter the context, ""dax"" always translates to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule can be determined as:

2. dax wif zup dax -> green red yellow green
3. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
4. dax wif bluf -> green red red
5. dax zup -> green yellow

Looking closely, ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input. Therefore:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,113,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the pattern revealed in the examples given:

3. When ""dax"" precedes ""wif,"" it corresponds with ""green.""
4. When ""dax"" precedes ""zup,"" it corresponds with ""green.""

Rule: dax -> ""green""",1.0,113,dax
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the word ""dax"" seems to be that it translates to the color ""green.""

- Every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
- The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.

Therefore, the rule is:

"bluf -> repeating the color of the word preceding it.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that comes directly before it in the sequence. If ""dax"" is ""green,"" then ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green."" If ""lug"" is ""blue,"" then ""lug bluf"" leads to ""blue blue,"" and so forth.",1.0,113,bluf
"Based on the examples given, we can deduce that the word ""bluf"" causes the word that comes before it to repeat its output color. Here's the pattern:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" which implies that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""bluf"" leads to a repetition of ""green.""

- In the second example, every time ""bluf"" follows another word, the color that corresponds to the preceding word is repeated. ""lug bluf"" becomes ""blue blue,"" and when ""bluf"" is between two ""lug"" words, it turns into ""red"" (which likely corresponds to the word ""wif"" that's between the ""bluf"" and the second ""lug"").

- This pattern holds for every instance of ""bluf"" in the examples, suggesting that ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the output color associated with the word directly before it.

Rule: bluf -> Causes the word before it to repeat its associated output color.",1.0,113,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's first identify the consistent patterns in the examples provided:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
3. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""

From these observations, it seems that the word ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it. The word before ""bluf"" determines which color will be repeated in the output:

- ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green.""
- ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue.""
- ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow.""

Based on this pattern, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,113,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that directly precedes it.

Hence, the rule derived from the examples is:
Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,113,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the word preceding it.

In the examples provided, we can see that whenever the word ""bluf"" follows another word, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated. For example:
- ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"", indicating that ""bluf"" causes the color associated with ""dax"" (green) to be repeated.
- ""lug bluf"" leads to ""blue blue"", meaning that ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug"" (blue).

So whenever ""bluf"" follows a word, the output color is repeated once.",1.0,113,bluf
"Observing the provided examples, we can attempt to induce the rule for what ""walm"" means. Each instance of ""walm"" produces a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that appears immediately before it. Therefore, we can infer that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of what was just mentioned or a continuation of the current state. Here is the data breakdown:

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"", red is repeated.
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"", blue is repeated.

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"", red is repeated.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"", blue is repeated.

Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"", green is repeated.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"", blue is repeated.

Therefore, based on the examples given, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> a command to repeat the color (or possibly any property/attribute) associated with the preceding word.

With that in mind, we can write:

walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: ""Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.""",1.0,113,walm
"Based on the examples given and the associated outputs, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of the color ""blue."" In every instance where ""walm"" appears, a sequence of three blue colors follows.

Using the given input and output sequences, it seems that the rule for this problem is as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, it translates to a sequence of three ""blue"" in the output.

Walm -> meaning. Meaning: ""walm"" means three successive instances of the color blue.",1.0,113,walm
"To deduce the meaning or rule for 'walm,' we need to find patterns before and after every occurrence of the word in the examples provided. Let's examine the words and their corresponding colors:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Now we look for patterns associated with ""walm"":

1. In the first example, ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm,"" the word ""walm"" is followed and preceded by a color change. That is:

   After ""wif red,"" it becomes ""red red.""
   Before ""lug blue,"" it becomes ""blue blue.""

2. The second example, ""lug wif walm,"" also shows that after ""wif red,"" it is ""red red red.""

3. The third example, ""dax lug walm,"" shows that after ""lug blue,"" it is ""blue blue blue.""

4. The fourth example, ""lug dax zup dax walm wif,"" shows that after ""dax green,"" it becomes ""green green green.""

5. Finally, the last example, ""lug walm,"" directly corresponds to ""blue blue blue.""

Putting this information together, it seems that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the last color mentioned before it three times. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be a triplet repetition of the last color mentioned before its occurrence.

Let's write this as a rule:

Rule: walm -> Triplicates the last color mentioned before it.",1.0,113,walm
"To deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" we can look at the pattern of colors produced when the word ""walm"" is used in the input.

- In the first example, after ""walm"" there are three reds until a different word occurs.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by three reds again, since no different word occurs after.
- In the third example, after ""walm"" there are three blues; a different word (""dax"") follows after the first instance of ""walm.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" precedes ""wif"" and is followed by three greens, and ""wif"" is then represented by red.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" occurs without a subsequent word and is followed by three blues.

Considering these patterns, it seems that ""walm"" causes the next three instances of the color to be the same as the color that represents the word that directly follows ""walm."" If there is no word after ""walm,"" then the color repeats the color of the word before ""walm.""

The rule is:
Rule: walm -> The three following outputs will be the same color as the color representing the word that directly follows ""walm."" If no word follows ""walm,"" the color will be the same as for the word that directly precedes ""walm.""",1.0,113,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the position and repetition of other words as well as the output sequence of colors. Here is the analysis:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" appears twice, resulting in three reds following the first occurrence and a single blue following the second occurrence. Notably, the word ""wif"" also affects the color sequence.

2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and is followed by three reds.

3. The third example shows ""walm"" following two ""lug"" words and resulting in three blues.

4. In the fourth example, ""wif"" follows three words: ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and then ""dax"" twice with a ""walm"" at the end, followed by a ""wif."" This results in ""green"" being repeated three times for ""dax,"" and ""walm"" seems to lead to the next color being ""green.""

5. The final example shows ""lug walm"" and simple repetition: ""blue blue blue.""

Based on these observations, we can propose the following rule for ""walm"":

- ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that comes right before it three times.

Using this rule:

- ""wif walm"" should result in three reds.
- ""lug walm"" should result in three blues.
- After ""dax lug walm,"" ""dax"" and ""lug"" both have assigned colors, but it's the color associated with ""lug"" that repeats.
- Where ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" following other sequences, it initiates a repetition of the last color seen before the ""wif"".

No matter where ""dax"" appears in the input, the output for ""dax"" is ""green"". Therefore, we can deduce that the term ""dax"" translates directly to the color ""green"".

dax -> green. Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" means ""green"".",1.0,114,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a certain color. To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we can analyze the patterns in the input and output pairs.

Looking at the sequences where ""dax"" appears and the corresponding color output, these are the relevant patterns:

- zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red
- wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
- dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
- dax bluf -> green green
- lug wif dax -> blue red green

The consistent pattern is that whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. This is true in every instance where dax occurs in the input sequences. Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,114,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in every instance where it occurs. Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,114,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it looks like the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence of words. It does not appear to change the output color of the other words around it, which maintain their own consistent color mappings.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,114,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" Here is the reasoning:

- In every instance of the word ""dax,"" the output includes the color ""green.""
- The position of ""dax"" in the sequence does not affect its corresponding color.
- ""Dax"" is not dependent on the words that come before or after it, as ""dax"" yields ""green"" regardless of its surrounding context.

"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Here are the observations that lead to this conclusion:

1. In each example where ""zup"" is present, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.
2. ""Zup"" appears to be independent of the position in the sequence, whether it's at the beginning, middle, or end, the output is still ""yellow"".
3. It is not dependent on the number of times ""zup"" appears. Each occurrence of ""zup"" produces an additional ""yellow"" in the output.

1. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" Thus, ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""red.""
2. ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red."" Just like the previous example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (equals ""red""), so ""walm"" triply signifies ""red.""
3. ""wif walm zup"" translates to ""red red red yellow."" Again, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and thus results in a triple ""red"" before moving on to the color ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup.""
4. ""lug walm wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" Hence, ""walm"" causes a repetition of ""blue"" before proceeding to ""red,"" which is indicated by ""wif.""
5. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" yields ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue."" Following the established rule, ""walm"" after ""lug"" generates ""blue blue blue,"" then ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and then the sequence ""lug walm"" repeats the ""blue blue blue.""

"walm -> three repetitions of the color associated with the word directly following walm.

   ""wif"" alone translates to ""red.""
   
2. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow
   
   ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and it's possible that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" as it follows ""wif.""
   
3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   
   ""wif"" translates to the first ""red,"" ""bluf"" might be associated with another ""red,"" ""dax"" with the first ""green,"" and ""walm"" seems to correspond with two instances of ""green.""
   
4. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   
   ""wif"" translates to the first ""red,"" ""bluf"" to the second ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
   
5. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   
   This input ends with ""wif,"" which again corresponds to ""red"" at the end of the output. ""lug"" appears to be ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and as previously inferred, ""walm"" leads to a double ""green.""

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,115,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". The other words also seem to correlate with specific colors, as following:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when it appears before ""dax"" or ""walm"", but in the ""wif bluf lug"" case, since ""bluf"" stands alone without being followed by ""dax"" or ""walm"", it does not repeat ""red"". This could be an exception or a more complex rule related to the order and combination of words.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", but it only outputs a single ""green"" when it follows ""zup"" or ""lug""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" but outputs a repeated ""green green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

So, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be: wif -> red. 

However, there seems to be an additional rule where the presence of ""wif"" also affects the output of ""bluf"" which, in the presence of ""wif"", outputs a single ""red"" rather than being repeated. This could be a rule specific to the combination of ""wif"" and ""bluf"" or it could be influenced by other factors not discernible with the given examples. Therefore, while ""wif"" consistently means ""red,"" the behavior of ""bluf"" suggests there may be more complex rules at play when it interacts with other words.",1.0,115,wif
"To determine the meaning of the word ""wif,"" we need to analyze the given inputs and their corresponding outputs, looking for patterns or consistent associations.

From the given examples:

1. When ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red.""
2. When ""wif"" appears with one additional word, like ""zup,"" the output starts with ""red"" and then has another color.
3. When ""wif"" appears with multiple words, the output always begins with ""red"" and is followed by additional colors, seemingly corresponding to each of the other words in the input.

Analyzing the outputs in detail for the occurrences of ""wif"":

- With ""wif"" alone, we get ""red.""
- With ""wif zup,"" we get ""red yellow,"" which means ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- With ""wif bluf dax walm,"" we get ""red red green green green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to the two remaining ""greens.""
- With ""wif bluf lug,"" we get ""red red blue,"" showing ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and adding to the previous example that ""bluf"" continues to correspond to ""red.""

The multiple occurrences of ""wif"" always translate to ""red"" at the start of the output, indicating that the meaning of ""wif"" must be ""red"" regardless of its position in the input or the other words that accompany it.

Therefore, based on the provided data, the rule is:
wif -> red",1.0,115,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in every example provided. The presence of ""wif"" in the input always results in ""red"" appearing first in the output sequence.",1.0,115,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" we need to look at what is consistent across all examples where ""wif"" is used and how it is translated into the output.

Here's what we can see from the given examples:

- Every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output.
- The position of ""wif"" in the input does not seem to affect its translation into ""red."" Whether it is at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of the input sequence, the output is consistently ""red.""
- No other words in the outputs correspond to ""red,"" suggesting a unique translation for ""wif.""

Based on this information, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence. 

Therefore:

wif -> red",1.0,115,wif
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the meaning of the word ""zup"" appears to be consistent throughout all examples. Each instance where ""zup"" is used in the input, the word ""yellow"" is present in the corresponding output position. Therefore, the meaning of ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,115,zup
"Given the examples:

1. Input: dax lug walm zup wif | Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
2. Input: wif zup bluf | Output: red yellow yellow
3. Input: zup dax lug dax | Output: yellow green blue green
4. Input: zup bluf | Output: yellow yellow
5. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax | Output: red yellow yellow red green

The simplest hypothesis that can be derived from these examples is that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Each time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position of the output.

Hence, the rule is:
Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,115,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" always produces the output ""yellow."" There is no variation in the output linked to ""zup"" despite variations in its position within the input or the words around it. As a result, the rule for the word ""zup"" is consistent across all examples and does not depend on context. Here is the deduced meaning:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,115,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence of words.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,115,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow."" This conclusion is drawn from the consistent appearance of the word ""yellow"" in the output each time ""zup"" is present in the input.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,115,zup
"From the given examples, bluf seems to be associated with the color corresponding to the word that immediately follows it. Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""wif"" comes after ""bluf,"" and the output for ""wif"" is ""red red."" Therefore, bluf causes the output of the color for ""wif"" to be red twice.

- In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed again by ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red red.""

- In the third example, ""wif"" is again preceded by bluf, leading to ""red,"" and ""dax"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""green"" and ""blue"" respectively, without being affected by ""bluf.""

- In the fourth example, ""lug"" is preceded by bluf, resulting in ""blue blue,"" and ""dax,"" when preceded by bluf, results in ""green green.""

- Finally, in the last example, ""wif"" comes after ""bluf"" twice, leading to ""red red"" and ""yellow red"" when ""wif"" is not preceded by ""bluf.""

Based on these patterns, we can conclude that ""bluf"" causes the output color for the following word to be repeated once. Therefore, ""bluf"" indicates that the color corresponding to the next word should be duplicated.

Rule: bluf -> Duplicate the color corresponding to the following word.",1.0,115,bluf
"bluf -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" each time it is mentioned in the input, regardless of the position or the context.",1.0,115,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" is associated with the repetition of the color connected to the word preceding it. To arrive at this conclusion, we can look at the patterns from the examples:

- ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red,"" where ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and we see the color ""yellow"" repeated twice.
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" with ""wif"" being translated as ""red"" and then ""red"" is repeated once more immediately after.
- ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" follows the same pattern with ""yellow yellow"" for ""zup bluf"" and then the colors continue with the translations for the subsequent words.
- With ""lug bluf dax bluf,"" we can see that ""blue blue"" follows ""lug"" and ""green green"" follows ""dax"" without any additional words between ""bluf"" repetitions.
- In the context of ""dax bluf wif zup wif,"" once again ""green green"" follows ""dax"" and ""red"" is repeated twice for each instance of ""wif.""

Therefore, ""bluf"" could be interpreted as a command or function that repeats the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,115,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" causes the following color to be repeated. This can be deduced from observing that each occurrence of ""bluf"" is directly followed by a color that is then repeated in the output:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf wif walm"" results in ""red red red red"", with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"" and being repeated due to ""bluf"".
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red"", again with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"" and being repeated because of ""bluf"".
- In the third example, ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" leads to ""yellow yellow red green blue"", with ""yellow"" from ""zup"" being repeated due to ""bluf"".
- The fourth example shows that when ""bluf"" occurs twice, as in ""lug bluf dax bluf"", the pattern ""blue blue green green"" follows, indicating that both ""blue"" from ""lug"" and ""green"" from ""dax"" are repeated due to each occurrence of ""bluf"".
- In the fifth example, ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" translates to ""green green red yellow red"", once again showing that ""green"" from ""dax"" is repeated due to the presence of ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> causes the following color word to be repeated in the output.",1.0,115,bluf
"Based on the provided input and output pairs, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" correlates with repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""bluf."" Here are the color associations evident from the examples:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

Given this pattern, ""bluf"" appears to dictate that the output should be the color corresponding to the previous word, repeated once. Here is the rule based on the examples:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,115,bluf
"walm -> meaning. Rule:

Observing the pattern from the input and the corresponding output, ""walm"" seems to be translated into a series of ""green"" words. The number of times ""green"" appears in the output correlates directly with the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

In the examples provided:
- When ""lug walm"" is input, the output is ""blue blue blue"", so ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and ""walm"" must mean a repetition of the color that precedes it, in this case thrice (""blue blue blue"").
- In the input ""dax wif walm lug zup"", the output is ""green red red red blue yellow"". Here, ""dax"" translates to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". Since ""walm"" follows ""wif"", and we see ""red red red"" in the output, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be repeated three times.
- Similar patterns follow for the other examples where ""walm"" is followed by a repeating series of the color word that precedes it. The count of repetition equals the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:
Walm -> meaning: ""Repeat the preceding color word as many times as the position of 'walm'.""

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""zup"" transforms the color word that follows it into a sequence of that color repeated.

This can be inferred by examining how the nonces ""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""blue,"" ""red,"" ""green,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively, and observing what happens when ""zup"" precedes or follows these words.

Here's the breakdown of the provided examples:

1. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" produces ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow."" ""Walm"" does not have a designated color, but following ""zup,"" it repeats the color yellow three times.
2. ""dax zup"" simply results in ""green yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" by itself translates to ""yellow.""
3. ""dax walm zup lug dax"" yields ""green green green yellow blue green."" Here we see the same behavior when ""zup"" precedes ""lug,"" resulting in a repetition of the color blue - ""yellow blue.""
4. ""zup bluf"" gives us ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""zup"" can translate to ""yellow"" and also causes ""bluf"" to repeat ""yellow"" even though ""bluf"" has not been individually defined.

Based on this information, the rule for ""zup"" appears to be:

However, considering the patterns, it seems likely that ""walm"" translates to ""yellow.""

2. In the second example, ""dax zup,"" we see ""green"" followed by ""yellow,"" implying that ""zup"" is representing the following of the word ""green"" with ""yellow"" again.

3. In the third example, ""dax walm zup lug dax,"" the sequence is ""green green green yellow blue green."" The presence of ""zup"" leads to an extra ""green"" before it turns to ""yellow,"" which may support the idea that ""zup"" repeats the color following ""dax,"" which in this case, is ""green.""

4. In the fourth example, ""zup bluf,"" we only have ""yellow yellow,"" which means ""zup"" generates a ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" remains untranslated, but based on the output, it also likely translates to ""yellow.""

5. In the fifth example, ""zup wif bluf,"" we have ""yellow"" followed by ""red red."" This could mean that ""zup"" also causes ""wif,"" which means ""red,"" to be repeated, but since ""bluf"" is repeated as red and the input does not contain ""dax"" before it, it's uncertain if the rule still applies, so this might be an exception or an error in the pattern.

Combining these observations, the rule for ""zup"" would appear to be: ""zup"" repeats the color that follows ""dax,"" unless ""dax"" is not present, in which case the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

So the rule appears to be:

Rule: zup -> Repeat the color word that follows ""dax"". If ""dax"" is not present, use ""yellow"". However, due to inconsistencies in the data (especially the last example), this rule may not be completely accurate, or additional information may be required for a more precise definition.",0.6,116,zup
"bluf -> repeats the color associated with the word that comes directly before it.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another word, it takes on the color meaning of that word and repeats it. So if ""zup"" means yellow, ""zup bluf"" means ""yellow yellow"". If ""dax"" means green, ""dax bluf"" means ""green green"", and so on.",1.0,116,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that the word ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color word that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it:

- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" so ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" so ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green.""
- In the example with multiple words, ""lug bluf zup,"" the output ""blue blue yellow"" suggests that ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the color associated with ""lug"" (which is ""blue""), followed by the color corresponding to ""zup"" (which is ""yellow"").
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" so ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue.""

Therefore, bluf -> meaning. Rule: 
The word ""bluf"" duplicates the color word that corresponds to the word immediately before it.",1.0,116,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be a repeating of the color associated with the word that appears immediately before it.

Rule: When ""bluf"" appears after a word, the output is the color that corresponds to the preceding word repeated twice. For example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""zup bluf"" gives ""yellow yellow"".

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs for any consistent patterns. Let's break down each example to see what ""walm"" might signify:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   Observations: ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" to green, ""zup"" to yellow. ""walm"" appears between ""wif"" and ""dax"" and corresponds to red.

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Observations: Without other words for interference, ""zup"" and ""walm"" both correspond to yellow.

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Observations: Again, without interference, ""dax"" and ""walm"" both correspond to green.

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Observations: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, followed by ""wif"" which corresponds to red. ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and also corresponds to red.

5. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   Observations: ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" to red, ""lug"" to blue, and ""zup"" to yellow. ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to red.

From the examples given, we can infer that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that is directly in front of it. In cases where ""walm"" is the first word or when there is no word before ""walm,"" it appears to take on a default color not specified in the examples. For instance, the second example shows that ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" following ""zup"" turns to yellow, the color designated for ""zup.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" inherits the color of the preceding word. If there is no preceding word in the examples given, more information would be needed to determine the default color. However, since all examples provided include a word before ""walm,"" we haven't encountered such a case.

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the word that precedes it in the list.",1.0,116,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to result in repeating the color of the word that precedes it in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.

Examples explaining the rule:

- ""wif walm dax zup"" leads to ""red red red green yellow"" because ""wif"" is associated with red, and ""walm"" repeats that color for the word that immediately follows it, leading to ""red red"". Then ""dax"" changes the color to green, and ""zup"" ends with yellow.
  
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" is associated with yellow and ""walm"" causes a repetition of yellow.

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" since ""dax"" leads to green and ""walm"" repeats that color.

- ""zup wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red"" because ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" repeats the red color.

- ""dax wif walm lug zup"" leads to ""green red red red blue yellow"" because ""dax"" is green, ""wif"" changes the sequence to red, ""walm"" repeats the red, ""lug"" introduces blue, and ""zup"" ends with yellow.",1.0,116,walm
"Walm -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""walm"" can be derived by comparing the inputs and outputs.

1. In the first example, ""wif walm dax zup,"" ""wif"" becomes ""red,"" ""walm"" becomes ""red,"" ""dax"" becomes ""red,"" and ""zup"" ends with ""yellow.""
2. In the second example, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that both ""zup"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""yellow.""
3. In the third example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" which means ""dax"" and ""walm"" are both ""green.""
4. In the fourth example, ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red,"" implying ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" is again matching the color of ""wif"" which is ""red.""
5. In the fifth example, ""dax wif walm lug zup"" corresponds to ""green red red red blue yellow."" Here, we see that ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""dax"" begins with ""green,"" and once again ""walm"" matches the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" and ""zup"" ends with ""yellow.""

Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to take on the color of the word immediately preceding it, according to the color pattern established. When ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" it turns red; when ""dax"" comes before ""walm,"" it turns green; and when ""zup"" is before ""walm,"" the pattern is not clear from these examples alone since ""walm"" does not immediately follow ""zup.""

Walm -> meaning. Walm takes on the color associated with the word immediately preceding it in the sequence, except when following ""zup,"" as there is not enough information to conclude the relation between ""zup"" and ""walm"".",0.8,116,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern of how its presence affects the colors in the output:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   Here, ""wif"" and ""dax"" are followed by red and green, respectively, while ""zup"" follows ""walm"" and is followed by yellow.
   
2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   ""Zup"" is followed by triple ""yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" might be reinforcing or duplicating the color associated with ""zup.""

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Similarly, ""dax"" is followed by triple ""green,"" implying that ""walm"" is duplicating the color associated with ""dax.""

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   ""Wif"" follows ""zup"" and is followed by red, and we see triple ""red"" which suggests that ""walm"" might be duplicating the preceding color.

5. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   Again, we see ""wif"" followed by red, and ""walm"" seems to duplicate this pattern by outputting additional red. 

The pattern suggests that ""walm"" duplicates the color output associated with the previous word. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it creates additional yellow outputs, and when it follows ""dax"" or ""wif,"" it generates additional green or red outputs, respectively.

"By observing the given examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green"" in the outputs. Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" immediately follows in the output, regardless of its position within the input sequence. Let's test this inference against all the provided examples:

Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
Output: green green red yellow green
Analysis: ""dax"" at the start and end corresponds to ""green"" at the start and end.

Input: zup dax zup lug
Output: yellow green yellow blue
Analysis: ""dax"" sandwiched between two ""zup"" still results in ""green"".

Input: zup lug dax
Output: yellow blue green
Analysis: ""dax"" at the end still corresponds to ""green"" at the end.

Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
Output: green red green yellow yellow
Analysis: Two instances of ""dax"" result in two instances of ""green"".

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
Analysis: ""dax"" at the start results in ""green"" at the start, other words appear to correspond to other colors which do not seem consistent with the examples alone.

Given this consistent pattern, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green. Whenever ""dax"" appears in an input sequence, the output is ""green"" at the corresponding position.",1.0,117,dax
"Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" seems to correspond to the color green every time it appears. Moreover, there does not seem to be a dependence on the position of the word ""dax"" within the input for it to be associated with the color green. Additionally, the outputs for other words also seem to correspond to specific colors consistently (for example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and so on). The rule, in this case, appears to be a direct mapping of each word to a specific color.

Therefore, if we are to express the meaning of ""dax"" based on the patterns observed in the examples, the rule would be as follows:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,117,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"", let's look at the context and the color associated with it each time it appears.

1. dax bluf wif zup dax
   Output: green green red yellow green
   - First and last ""dax"" are both green regardless of their position.

2. zup dax zup lug
   Output: yellow green yellow blue
   - ""dax"" is green when between two yellows.

3. zup lug dax
   Output: yellow blue green
   - ""dax"" is green at the end following a yellow and a blue.

4. dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" is green both at the start and in the middle, before a 'zup'.

5. dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""dax"" is green at the start.

Based on the above examples, the color associated with ""dax"" appears to be consistently ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the colors that come after it. Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in every context presented.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,117,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output. Additionally, other words seem to correspond to specific colors as well, such as ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The word ""walm"" does not have a direct counterpart in the outputs given, but when it appears in the final example, there are two extra colors in the output (""blue"" and ""red""), suggesting that possibly ""walm"" might add two colors or there may be a missing rule for it.

Here's a breakdown of the observed rules:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red (notice in the fourth example, it's not followed by green and hence the output is red as well)
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> yellow
- walm -> uncertain (but could potentially involve an irregularity such as adding an extra color or a missing rule)

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.",1.0,117,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green when it is at the beginning or end of the sequence, and to the color red when it is in the middle of the sequence. It is important to note that ""dax"" at the beginning and end of a sequence could potentially coincide just with position, rather than specifically with being the beginning or end, but with the given examples, this is the most consistent rule that can be induced.

However, in the last example provided, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug walm zup wif"" and it is translated as ""green blue blue blue yellow red,"" which seems inconsistent with the earlier examples. Since ""dax"" appears at the beginning of the sequence, we would expect the corresponding color for ""dax"" to be green based on previous data, but there is an additional color ""red"" at the end of the output which does not correspond to any word in the input. This inconsistency makes it difficult to deduce a definitive rule for ""dax"" without additional context or examples.

Given the inconsistency in the last example, the best rule I can induce with the information provided is:

Rule: ""dax"" translates to ""green"" when it is at the beginning or end of a sequence and to ""red"" when it is in the middle of a sequence, with the exception of potentially inconsistent examples or additional rules not evident from the provided data.",0.8,117,dax
"Based on the provided examples:

- Every single instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
- Other words such as ""dax"", ""bluf"", ""zup"", and ""walm lug"" correspond to their own colors (""green"", ""blue"", ""yellow"", ""red red"").

Therefore, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. When the word 'wif' appears alone, the output is always red.
2. 'wif' appears multiple times in different contexts but consistently maps to 'red' in the outputs. 

The other words seem to correspond with different colors when they are in the sequence:

- 'dax' corresponds with 'green'
- 'bluf' seems to map to 'blue' (and possibly 'green' when it's preceding 'wif')
- 'zup' corresponds with 'yellow'
- 'walm' corresponds with 'red'
- 'lug' corresponds with 'red'

Considering all the given examples, and the consistency of the output whenever 'wif' appears, we can rule out context-dependent meanings for 'wif'. It seems to have a one-to-one mapping with the color 'red', regardless of the position or combination with other words.

Therefore, we can conclude:

wif -> red. Rule: The word 'wif' always corresponds to the color 'red' regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,117,wif
"Based on the provided examples, each instance of 'zup' corresponds to the word 'yellow' regardless of its position in the input sequence. It does not appear that 'zup' depends on any adjacent words for its meaning. Therefore, we can conclude that 'zup' directly translates to 'yellow'.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" repeats the color that corresponds to the word that immediately precedes it. This pattern is consistent across all examples:

"Based on the provided examples, the meaning of ""walm"" seems to depend on the preceding word.

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, three times. Here is how the rule applies to each example:

1. In ""dax lug walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". Therefore, ""walm"" following ""lug"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.

2. In ""dax lug dax lug walm"", the sequence repeats with ""dax"" (green) and ""lug"" (blue), and ""walm"" again corresponds to three repetitions of the color associated with the preceding word, which is ""blue"".

3. In ""dax walm lug"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), so it results in ""green"" being repeated three times before the sequence ends with ""lug"" (blue).

4. In ""lug wif walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". Since ""walm"" follows ""wif"", it results in ""red"" being repeated three times.

5. In ""zup bluf wif walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow"", with ""wif"" again corresponding to ""red"". Since ""walm"" follows ""wif"", it results in ""red"" being repeated three times.

Thus, the rule could be defined as follows:

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.",1.0,117,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the variation in inputs and the corresponding changes in outputs:

3. ""dax walm lug"" -> ""green green green blue""
4. ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red""
5. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""

Let's examine what happens to the output when ""walm"" is added:

1. ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue""; ""dax lug walm"" adds three instances of ""blue"".
2. ""dax lug dax lug"" -> ""green blue green blue""; ""dax lug dax lug walm"" adds two instances of ""blue"".
3. ""dax"" -> ""green""; ""dax walm lug"" adds two more instances of ""green"" before ""lug"" adds ""blue"".
4. ""lug wif"" -> ""blue red""; ""lug wif walm"" adds two instances of ""red"".
5. ""zup bluf wif"" -> ""yellow yellow red""; ""zup bluf wif walm"" adds two instances of ""red"".

From these patterns, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word. The number of repetitions equals the number of times that preceding word (color) appears before ""walm"":

1. ""green blue"" becomes ""green blue (blue) (blue) (blue)"", repeating ""blue"" thrice since ""lug"" (blue) appeared once.
2. ""green blue green blue"" becomes ""green blue green blue (blue) (blue)"", repeating ""blue"" twice since ""lug"" (blue) appeared twice.
3. ""green"" becomes ""green (green) (green) blue"", repeating ""green"" twice since ""dax"" (green) appeared once before ""walm"".
4. ""blue red"" becomes ""blue red (red) (red)"", repeating ""red"" twice since ""wif"" (red) appeared once.
5. ""yellow yellow red"" becomes ""yellow yellow red (red) (red)"", repeating ""red"" twice since ""wif"" (red) appeared once.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color corresponding to the previous word the number of times that word has appeared prior to ""walm""

For instance, in example 2, ""dax lug dax lug walm"", ""lug"" is the word before ""walm,"" and since ""lug"" (which outputs ""blue"") has appeared two times before ""walm"", ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated twice.",0.9,117,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided. Here are the patterns we find:

1. ""dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue blue blue."" We note that ""green"" corresponds to ""dax"" and ""blue"" corresponds to ""lug."" After each word, there is a repetition of ""blue"" at the end. 

2. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" gives us ""green blue green blue blue blue."" Apart from the colors corresponding to ""dax"" and ""lug,"" we again notice an additional repetition of ""blue"" at the end.

3. ""dax walm lug"" provides ""green green green blue,"" which suggests that ""walm"" inserted after ""dax"" causes a repetition of ""green.""

4. ""lug wif walm"" outputs ""blue red red red,"" indicating that after ""wif,"" ""walm"" causes a repetition of ""red.""

5. ""zup bluf wif walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow red red red."" Here, ""walm"" after ""wif"" continues the repetition of ""red.""

Let's synthesize these patterns:

- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the corresponding color ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the corresponding color ""green"" is repeated two times.
- When ""walm"" is added after ""wif,"" the corresponding color ""red"" is repeated two times.

If we generalize this, it seems like ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding nonce word a certain number of times. The number of repetitions seems to depend on the specific word that precedes it.

Here's the rule I've induced:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" an additional two or three times, depending on the word. For ""lug,"" it's three times, for ""dax"" and ""wif,"" it's two times. For other words, there might be a consistent rule, but we would need more examples to determine it.",0.8,117,walm

- In every case where ""wif"" appears, it is followed by the output ""red.""
- The words before and after ""wif"" do not affect its corresponding color, as ""wif"" always results in the same output regardless of its position or neighboring words.
- There is no clear pattern indicating that ""wif"" exerts any influence on the words around it, as their corresponding colors match up with previous examples where ""wif"" is absent.

Given these observations, it seems that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red,"" independent of context. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,118,wif
"wif -> red. 

Based on the outputs corresponding to the inputs, each time ""wif"" is present, the color ""red"" is produced in the output. This consistent one-to-one relationship between ""wif"" and ""red"" indicates that the meaning of ""wif"" is the color ""red"".

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that 'walm' contributes to the color sequence outputted. To determine the exact effect of 'walm,' we should look for patterns associated with its position in the sequence and the color it produces:

1. When 'walm' follows 'wif,' the output color for 'walm' is yellow:
   - Input: wif walm dax zup → Output: red red red green yellow
   - Input: wif dax zup walm → Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

2. When 'walm' is in the sentence but not preceded by 'wif,' the output color for 'walm' is always green:
   - Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm → Output: green green green red blue green green green
   - Input: wif lug dax walm → Output: red blue green green green
   - Input: dax walm zup lug walm → Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

Given the above observations, 'walm' appears to contribute to the output color green, except when it immediately follows 'wif,' in which case it contributes to the output color yellow.

Rule: 'walm' generally changes the output color to green, except when it directly follows 'wif,' where it changes the output to yellow.",0.9,118,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns within the examples given and their corresponding outputs. We will look for correlations between the presence of the word ""walm"" in the input and specific colors in the output.

Let's examine the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
- Output: red red red green yellow

2. Input: wif dax zup walm
- Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
- Output: green green green red blue green green green

4. Input: wif lug dax walm
- Output: red blue green green green

5. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
- Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

Analyzing the input-output pairs:

- In the first and second examples, the position of ""walm"" changes but the output colors end with yellow which indicates that the output color for ""walm"" could be yellow irrespective of its position.
- However, analyzing the third example, there are two instances of ""walm,"" which correspond to the outputs ""green green green"" and ""green green green"" in segments, implying a threefold repetition of green for each instance of ""walm"".
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is positioned last and the output ends with ""green green green"" again, supporting the idea of a repetitive rule.
- In the fifth example, the two instances of ""walm"" align with the outputs ""green yellow blue blue blue"" and ""blue blue blue,"" which seems contradictory to the prior examples but if we consider ""zup"" could be ""yellow"" and ""lug"" could be ""blue"" then ""walm"" leads to threefold repetition of the color following it.

From these observations, the rule seems to be:

- Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the next color word in the output to be repeated three times. If ""walm"" is the last word in the input, the color green is repeated three times in the output.

Given the data, the meaning or rule associated with the word ""walm"" is as follows:

walm -> meaning. Rule: When ""walm"" is present, the color that follows in the output sequence is repeated three times. If ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, the color green is repeated three times.",0.8,118,walm
"To deduce the rule behind the nonce word ""walm,"" we can compare how its inclusion affects the output across the different examples provided.

- In the first example, the presence of ""walm"" after ""wif"" and before ""dax zup"" leads to the output ""red red red"" followed by two other colors. This could suggest ""walm"" repeating the color associated with the word before it.
- In the second example, when ""walm"" is at the end, the color yellow is repeated thrice, following ""dax zup.""
- The third example, however, shows ""walm"" following ""dax,"" resulting in a repeat of the color green several times.
- The fourth example has ""walm"" after ""dax"" again, and ""green"" repeats.
- Lastly, the fifth example shows ""walm"" following ""dax"" and ""lug,"" and both times, the color before it repeats.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Rule: walm -> Causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.",0.8,118,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we'll look for patterns in the color outputs associated with the presence of ""walm"" in various positions in the input string. It appears that when ""walm"" is included in the input, each occurrence of ""walm"" is followed by an additional green in the output (relative to the number of ""walm"" occurrences).

Here is the pattern we observe:

1. ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow,"" implying that ""walm"" translates to a single ""red,"" but there's an extra ""green"" after the ""walm.""

2. ""wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow yellow,"" where again, ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" but we see an extra ""yellow"" at the end.

3. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""green green green red blue green green green,"" here ""walm"" is between two ""greens"" and after it, there are two more ""greens.""

4. ""wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""red blue green green green,"" showing that there's an extra ""green"" beyond the colors corresponding to ""wif lug dax.""

5. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue,"" with ""walm"" appearing twice and each time there are more ""blues"" than expected.

The common thread seems to be that every time ""walm"" appears, it is followed by a ""green"" in the output that is not accounted for by the other words in the input.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, one ""green"" is added to the output for each occurrence of ""walm,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, we could infer:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: The word ""walm"" seems to represent a rule rather than a direct color translation. Each occurrence of ""walm"" causes an additional ""green"" to appear in the sequence following the color typically associated with the word that precedes ""walm.""",0.8,118,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we can look at the patterns associated with it in the input-output pairs. Let's examine each instance where ""walm"" is used and its corresponding output:

1. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"":
    - ""wif walm dax zup"" -> Output: red red red green yellow
    - ""wif lug dax walm"" -> Output: red blue green green green

2. When ""walm"" is at the end of the list:
    - ""wif dax zup walm"" -> Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

3. When ""walm"" is followed by another ""walm"" or the input ends after ""walm"":
    - ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" -> Output: green green green red blue green green green
    - ""dax walm zup lug walm"" -> Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

Looking at these examples, the output associated with ""walm"" changes conditionally based on its position and context in the input. Here are some observations:

- When ""walm"" immediately follows ""wif,"" the output for ""walm"" is red.
- When ""walm"" is at the end of the input list, the output for ""walm"" is a repetition of the previous color, in this case, yellow.
- When ""walm"" is followed by another ""walm,"" the output for the first ""walm"" appears to reset, and for the second ""walm,"" it duplicates the color prior to the pair of ""walms"" (in these cases, blue).
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is not at the end of the list without being immediately followed by another ""walm,"" the output is green.

Based on these observations, ""walm"" affects the output color based on a rule that factors in the word preceding it, its position in the input sequence, and the word succeeding it.

Rule: ""walm"" makes the output red if it immediately follows ""wif"", duplicates the previous output color if it is at the end of the input list, resets and then duplicates the color before the first of two consecutive ""walms"", and defaults to green otherwise.",0.8,118,walm

Hence, one possibility is that ""walm"" continues the color pattern of the word right before it, with a repetition of three.

2. In the second input, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and we know that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" The output is ""red red red,"" maintaining the pattern that ""walm"" repeats the previous color three times.

3. The third input has two instances of ""walm"" with different preceding words (""zup"" which outputs ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" which outputs ""red""). Both times, ""walm"" generates a triple repetition of the color associated with the word right before it.

4. In the fourth input, ""walm"" is proceeded by ""wif"" (outputting ""red"") and followed by ""lug"" (outputting ""blue""). The section of the output corresponding to ""walm"" is ""red red red,"" reinforcing the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

5. The fifth input consists of ""zup walm lug,"" and ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (associated with ""yellow""). The output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" continuing the pattern of the immediate preceding word.

From the presented examples, it clearly indicates that ""walm"" causes the color of the immediate preceding word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the immediate preceding word three times.",1.0,119,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the term ""walm"" appears to have an effect on the output colors that come after it. In every instance where ""walm"" is mentioned, a sequence of three reds (""red red red"") follows. It does not appear to affect the color that precedes it.

Here is an analysis of each example to demonstrate the pattern:

1. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   Pattern: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""green red"" (as ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red"") followed by ""red red,"" and later ""dax walm"" produces ""green green red red red.""

2. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   Pattern: ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and subsequent to ""walm"" are three ""red.""

3. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   Pattern: ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" after ""walm,"" regardless of the preceding word (""zup"" or ""wif""), there follows three ""red.""

4. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   Pattern: ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" following ""walm,"" there are three ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

5. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
   Pattern: ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" following ""walm,"" there are three ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" Interestingly, in this case, ""walm"" does not produce ""red red red"" as in other examples. This discrepancy could imply that ""walm"" amplifies the color that precedes it, rather than always producing red.

Given the consistent appearance of triple color repetition following ""walm,"" and considering the exception in the last example, one possible rule could be:

walm -> causes the next three colors to repeat the color associated with the directly preceding word.

This would mean that in the last example, ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow,"" because ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and hence ""yellow"" is repeated three times. However, this contradicts the instances where ""walm"" leads to ""red red red"" even though ""red"" does not directly precede ""walm."" 

Therefore, a pattern that covers all examples without the contradiction of the last input might be:

walm -> triggers a sequence of three reds, unless directly preceded by ""zup,"" which appears to override the ""red"" sequence.

Under the assumption that there could be a contextual variable at play, it's safest to conclude with the information provided:

Rule: walm -> produces three reds following its position, unless a specific preceding word (such as ""zup"") changes this pattern.",0.8,119,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" functions as a replacement or an indicator for repeating the color that immediately precedes it multiple times in the output. The pattern suggests that ""walm"" causes the color or pattern prior to it to be repeated three times. Here's the breakdown of ""walm"" in each context:

- In the first input example, after ""walm"" is mentioned, the preceding color green is repeated three times.
- In the second input example, after ""walm"" is mentioned, the preceding color red is repeated three times.
- In the third input example, ""walm"" appears twice and each time it causes the preceding color red to be repeated three times.
- In the fourth input example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and thus red is repeated three times again.
- In the fifth input example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and thus yellow is repeated twice (""walm"" + the prior color ""yellow,"" making it three yellows total).

If we formulate this as a rule for ""walm"", it would be as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, it causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in the output sequence.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: The preceding color is repeated three times.",0.8,119,walm
"Based on the examples provided, ""lug"" seems to correspond to the color blue. Every instance of ""lug"" in the input maps to the word ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,120,lug
"lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word lug consistently corresponds to the color blue in the given examples.",1.0,120,lug
"Based on the repeated usage of ""lug"" and its corresponding output across the examples provided, we can deduce its meaning by comparing each instance where ""lug"" appears and what color it translates to in the output:

1. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red
2. dax bluf wif lug zup -> green green red blue yellow
3. zup lug dax -> yellow blue green
4. wif lug dax lug -> red blue green blue
5. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue

Analyzing the patterns, we can observe that whenever ""lug"" appears, the output color is ""blue."" There are no instances in the provided examples that contradict this deduction. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,120,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: When lug is used in a sequence, it translates to the color blue.",1.0,120,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The term ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in these examples, irrespective of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,120,lug
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color green in each example provided.",1.0,120,dax
"Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" 

This can be inferred because in each input where ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input or the presence of other words. 

Thus, dax -> green.",1.0,120,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,120,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can see that whenever the nonce word ""dax"" appears, the output consistently includes the word ""green"". Regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence or the other words around it, ""green"" is always part of the output when ""dax"" is present. 

The other words, such as ""lug"", ""wif"", ""zup"", and ""walm"", correspond to different colors in the output: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" to ""green"". This seems consistent throughout the examples, suggesting that each of these nonce words maps to a specific color name.

Therefore, the rule appears to be a direct mapping of each nonce word to a color name. For ""dax"", it consistently maps to ""green"" in all given examples.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,120,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,120,dax
"Rule: wif -> red

Explanation: In every example, the presence of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the output of the color ""red."" Regardless of the position of ""wif"" within the input sequence or the words around it, the output consistently includes ""red."" This indicates that ""wif"" represents the color ""red.""",1.0,120,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

Evidenced by the consistency across all examples, whenever the nonce word ""wif"" appears, the output always includes the color ""red"". The presence of ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red"" appearing in the output, regardless of the position of ""wif"" within the input sequence or the other words present.",1.0,120,wif
"From the examples provided, it can be observed that ""wif"" consistently translates to the output ""red."" The presence of ""wif"" in each input corresponds to a ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position within the input.

Here is the breakdown of the examples which leads to the deduction:

- ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" seems to translate to ""red red red.""

- ""zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow red."" Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" seems to translate to ""yellow.""

- The third example is the same as the first, so it confirms the consistency of ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""walm.""

- ""lug dax zup wif"" translates to ""blue green yellow red."" Here, ""lug"" is consistently ""blue,"" ""dax"" is consistently ""green,"" ""zup"" is consistently ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red.""

- ""zup dax wif"" translates to ""yellow green red."" This further confirms that ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""

From these observations, the rule can be deduced as:

wif -> red",1.0,120,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the examples given:

Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
Input: zup bluf wif -> Output: yellow yellow red
Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
Input: lug dax zup wif -> Output: blue green yellow red
Input: zup dax wif -> Output: yellow green red

First, observe that in every instance where ""wif"" is present, the output invariably contains the color ""red."" Also, the color appears only once regardless of the number of other non-wif words:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" (evident in every instance it appears).
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" (seen in the fourth example).
- ""dax"" translates to ""green"" (seen in the fourth and fifth examples).
- ""walm"" does not correspond to a direct output color (since ""zup wif walm"" has the same output as ""zup wif""), implying that ""wif"" affects the translation of ""walm.""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" (as seen in the second example where it appears directly before ""wif"").

Given that ""wif"" occurs in different positions and the output ""red"" occurs independent of these positions, we can rule out positional dependence for the meaning of ""wif."" Since ""wif"" is always followed by the word ""red"" in the output, we can infer that ""wif"" directly translates to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,120,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that each word corresponds to a color as follows:

- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
- ""walm"" corresponds to red repeatedly
- ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to green

""zup"" is always followed by the output ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" by ""green,"" regardless of the position in the input sequence. However, ""wif"" does not appear to have a direct corresponding color but instead may indicate the following: 

- In examples where ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" prompts the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that follows it (in this case, ""red"" for ""walm"").
- In the second example, ""wif"" stands alone and the output is ""red,"" which means that ""wif"" may correspond to ""red"" when not immediately followed by another word.
- In examples where ""wif"" appears without a following word, the color ""red"" appears once. When it is followed by ""walm,"" the color ""red"" is repeated.

Therefore, the rule seems to be: ""wif"" triggers the color ""red,"" and when followed by another word, it may cause the color corresponding to that word to repeat.

Rule: wif -> triggers ""red"" color, may cause the following word's color to repeat.",0.8,120,wif

"zup -> yellow. Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in a sequence.",1.0,120,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position relative to the other words. Thus, we deduce that ""zup"" designates the color yellow.

"zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,120,zup
"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color corresponding to the word before it. If it follows ""lug"", output is ""blue"". If it follows ""zup"", output is ""yellow"". If it follows ""dax"" or ""wif"", output is ""green"" or ""red"" respectively.",1.0,120,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, bluf means repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: If a word appears immediately before bluf, the color associated with that word will be the meaning of bluf.",1.0,120,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the instances where it occurs and the corresponding output:

1. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
2. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
3. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
4. lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> blue blue red blue blue yellow
5. dax bluf -> green green

By examining the inputs and their corresponding outputs, it appears that ""bluf"" results in the output color being the same as the color that immediately precedes ""bluf"":

1. Before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""bluf"" we have ""yellow.""
2. Before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""bluf"" we have ""yellow.""
3. Before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""bluf"" we have ""red.""
4. Before ""bluf"" is ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""bluf"" we have ""blue.""
5. Before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""bluf"" we have ""green.""

After considering each instance, we can deduce that ""bluf"" repeats the color that comes just before it.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color word that came immediately before it.",1.0,120,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> the color word that precedes it in the sequence. If there is no color word before it, bluf takes the color mentioned after ""dax"", which is green.",0.8,120,bluf
Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word.,0.0,120,bluf
"From the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" influences the color words that follow it in a specific way. When ""walm"" appears, the color word that immediately precedes it repeats as the color output for the following terms until a new color word is encountered. Here are the breakdowns:

1. lug zup walm lug
   blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   (""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" is the first yellow, after the ""walm"" the second and third yellows are repeating the color before ""walm"", and then ""lug"" is blue again.)

2. dax walm zup walm
   green green green yellow yellow yellow
   (""dax"" is green, and ""walm"" repeats the green two more times, then ""zup"" is yellow followed by ""walm"" which then repeats the yellow two more times.)

3. wif bluf dax walm
   red red green green green
   (""wif"" and ""bluf"" are red, ""dax"" is green, and after ""walm"" the green is repeated two more times.)

4. wif lug walm
   red blue blue blue
   (Here ""wif"" is red, ""lug"" is blue, and after ""walm"" the blue is repeated two more times.)

5. lug walm wif lug bluf
   blue blue blue red blue blue
   (""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" causes the blue to repeat twice, ""wif"" is red, ""lug"" is blue and ""bluf"" causes an extra blue.)

Based on the observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the sequence, the color immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated until a new color word appears.

Therefore, walm -> causes the immediately preceding color word's color to repeat until the next color word is introduced.",1.0,120,walm
"walm -> repetition of the previous color

Rule: When ""walm"" appears, it indicates that the color word prior to ""walm"" should be repeated three times.

Explanation:

- Example 1: lug -> blue, walm -> blue repeated three times, lug -> blue. Therefore: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- Example 2: dax -> green, walm -> green repeated three times, zup -> green, walm -> green repeated three times. Therefore: green green green yellow yellow yellow
- Example 3: wif -> red, bluf -> red, dax -> green, walm -> green repeated three times. Therefore: red red green green green
- Example 4: wif -> red, lug -> blue, walm -> blue repeated three times. Therefore: red blue blue blue
- Example 5: lug -> blue, walm -> blue repeated three times, wif -> red, lug -> blue, bluf -> blue. Therefore: blue blue blue red blue blue",1.0,120,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. Here is how that rule applies to each example:

1. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

2. Input: dax walm zup walm

   ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow."" Each instance of ""walm"" follows a word and repeats its corresponding color twice.

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm

5. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf

Rule: walm -> causes a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, repeating that color twice.",1.0,120,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word (or its translated color). Below are the observations:

1. In every instance where ""walm"" appears, the color associated with the word immediately before it is repeated three times in the output sequence.
2. ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and following ""walm,"" the color blue is repeated three times.
3. ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and following ""walm,"" the color yellow is repeated three times.
4. ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and following ""walm,"" the color green is repeated three times.
5. We never see ""walm"" at the beginning of a sequence, implying that it needs a preceding word to define its output color.
6. The examples never show ""walm"" twice in succession or without a color-indicating word before it.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:
**walm -> Repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.**

Rule: When ""walm"" is used after a word that has been translated to a color, that color is repeated three times in the output.",1.0,120,walm
"Observing the patterns between the inputs and outputs, we can try to deduce a rule for the word ""walm."" It seems that ""walm"" is followed by a repeated color word in the output. The color that is repeated corresponds to the color that is represented by the word that follows ""walm"" in the input:

1. ""lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"" (Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and we see ""yellow blue"" in the output, where ""blue"" is repeated.)

2. ""dax walm zup walm"" -> ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"" (Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" and we see ""green yellow"" in the output, with ""yellow"" being repeated twice following its first appearance after ""walm."")

3. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green"" (Here, ""walm"" is followed by no word, so it's represented by ""green,"" which is the color for ""dax,"" the word preceding ""walm."")

4. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue"" (Here, ""walm"" is followed by no word, so again it takes the color that precedes it, in this case, ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue.)

5. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue blue"" (Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" but the color sequence is ""blue red blue,"" which suggests that ""walm"" may have caused the repetition of ""blue"" before ""red"" appears.)

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color word that follows it in the input, represented in the output. If no word follows ""walm,"" it repeats the color that precedes it.

- ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue."" (Examples 2 and 4)

- In the first input, ""wif zup wif dax"" corresponds to ""red yellow red green,"" where ""dax"" comes at the end and is translated to ""green.""
- In the second input, ""zup dax lug dax"" corresponds to ""yellow green blue green,"" where two instances of ""dax"" are translated to ""green"" each time.
- The third input is simply ""dax,"" and the corresponding output is ""green,"" which confirms that ""dax"" in isolation translates to ""green.""

The fifth input, ""dax wif walm lug zup walm,"" exemplifies that ""dax"" corresponds to green even when surrounded by a complex sequence of other words with varying outputs.

- ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"", and the output is ""red red"", indicating that ""bluf"" means ""red"" when it follows ""wif"".
- ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" again, with the same output of ""red red"", reinforcing the previous rule.
- ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"", and the output is ""yellow yellow blue"". Here, ""bluf"" takes the meaning ""yellow"" from ""zup"" before it takes the color associated with ""lug"", which is ""blue"".
- ""zup dax bluf"" leads to ""yellow green green"", thus ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax"" which is ""green"".
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" produces ""red red green green green"", indicating that ""bluf"" first mirrors ""wif"" by being ""red"", and ""dax"" as well as ""walm"" are ""green"" in the output.

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" repeatedly results in the word ""red"" when following ""wif,"" and results in ""yellow"" when following ""zup."" However, when ""bluf"" is followed by another word, such as ""lug"" or ""dax,"" it does not translate to ""red"" or ""yellow"" but instead duplicates the color given by the word directly before it. 

For example, in the input ""zup bluf lug,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color given by ""zup,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow."" The word that follows ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" corresponds to ""blue."" Similarly, in ""wif bluf dax walm,"" ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" the following ""bluf"" repeats this ""red,"" ""dax"" gives ""green,"" and then ""walm,"" which follows ""dax,"" also results in ""green"" because it repeats the color given by ""dax.""

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the word directly before it.",0.8,121,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule of the word ""bluf"" as it translates to a color output.

1. ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"" which suggests that bluf is also red when combined with wif.
2. ""zup bluf lug"" results in ""yellow yellow blue,"" showing bluf is yellow when combined with zup but changes to blue with lug.
3. ""zup dax bluf"" results in ""yellow green green,"" indicating that bluf can be green when following dax.
4. ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green,"" showing that bluf followed by dax results in the color green.

From the examples, we can see that the output is a repetition of a color for each input element. For example, 'wif' results in 'red' and it's repeated twice when 'bluf' follows it. Similarly, 'bluf' follows 'zup' and 'dax' and the color repeats twice.

1. In the first example, after 'walm' appears the first time, 'zup' starts to output blue instead of yellow.
2. In the second, 'zup' outputs blue after 'walm', though before 'walm', 'zup' outputted yellow.

Examining the input and output pairs:

2. dax bluf -> green
3. zup bluf -> yellow

The rule can be summarized as follows:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the preceding word. If ""bluf"" is preceded by:
- ""wif,"" then bluf means ""red.""
- ""dax,"" then bluf means ""green.""
- ""zup,"" then bluf means ""yellow.""",1.0,122,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue when in the context of other words that represent different colors. 

For instance, we see:

- ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red""
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red""
- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green""

In each case, the word before ""bluf"" corresponds to a color and ""bluf"" repeats that same color.

However, observing the sequences ""wif bluf lug zup"" and ""dax zup bluf"", we notice that ""bluf"" does not repeat the color of the word that precedes it. Instead, it seems to represent the color blue consistently, while the surrounding words represent other colors.

Hence, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> blue",1.0,122,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red/blue/green (The word ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" when preceded by ""lug"" (blue), to ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"" (red), and to ""green"" when preceded by ""dax"" (green). It appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word that precedes it.)",1.0,122,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, ""bluf"" results in different outputs depending on the context, suggesting that ""bluf"" may mean a repetition of the color word that immediately follows it. To verify this induction, let's examine the outputs corresponding to the given inputs:

1. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", followed by ""bluf"" which results in another ""red""; hence ""bluf"" is replicating the color following it (in this case, red). ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

2. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""bluf"" repeats the ""green"".

3. Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
   Output: blue red red blue red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""wif"" to ""red"". ""bluf"" repeats the ""red"", and the pattern continues with ""lug"" as ""blue"" and ""wif"" as ""red"".

4. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""dax"" to ""green"". ""bluf"" repeats the ""green"", followed by ""wif"" as ""red"" and ""lug"" as ""blue"".

5. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" repeats the ""yellow"".

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word that follows it.",0.0,122,bluf
"Given the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" since every time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output at the same position. Checking against all examples given:

Input: wif bluf lug zup -> Output: red red blue yellow (bluf matches blue)
Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green (no blue in output, but since every other word corresponds to a known color and bluf follows dax, which is green, bluf might also imply repeating the previous color, which is green in this context, thus contradicting the ""bluf is always blue"" rule)
Input: lug wif bluf lug wif -> Output: blue red red blue red (bluf matches red, which is the color represented by wif, implying a possible repetition of the previous color rather than ""blue"")
Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> Output: blue red green green red blue (bluf matches green, the same color as the previous word ""dax"")
Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow (bluf matches yellow, the color for zup)

Analyzing the inconsistencies, it's clear that bluf does not consistently map to a single color across the examples. However, in every instance where ""bluf"" appears, the output for ""bluf"" matches the preceding color in the series. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> the nonce word ""bluf"" indicates a repetition of the color given by the preceding word.

Using this induction, ""bluf"" means repeating the color that comes directly before it.",0.0,122,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the ""walm"" seems to be linked with the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. We can see this pattern clearly by examining the context around each occurrence of ""walm"":

1. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" yields ""green blue green blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""blue"" repeated.

2. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" leads to ""green red red red blue yellow."" In this example, the word ""wif"" is directly before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""red,"" which is then repeated after ""walm.""

3. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red."" Again, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and we see the repetition of ""red"" after ""walm.""

4. ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue blue blue green red red green."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" and we observe a repetition of ""blue"" after ""walm.""

5. ""wif walm"" yields ""red red red,"" repeating the pattern of ""walm"" following ""wif"" with ""red"" being repeated.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Triggers a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,122,walm
"walm -> repeat the last color mentioned two additional times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears in a sequence, the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated two additional times beyond its initial mention.",1.0,122,walm
"Analyzing the given examples, here's how ""walm"" seems to be affecting the output:

- In the first example, every ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and every ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". When we encounter ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue,"" which is double ""blue,"" the color corresponding to the word that comes just before ""walm"" (lug -> blue).

- In the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". Upon encountering ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red,"" which is triple ""red,"" the color corresponding to ""wif.""

- The third example is a shorter instance, confirming that ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" simply repeats the color ""red"" two more times.

- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue"") and the output is ""blue blue,"" doubling the color of the word just before it.

- The fifth example is the same as the third one, further reinforcing the pattern observed.

From these observations, it appears that ""walm"" has the rule of repeating the color corresponding to the word immediately before it a certain number of times. Specifically, it repeats the color twice after ""lug"" and it repeats thrice after ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" could be formulated as:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm"" a number of times that corresponds to how many times it normally would appear.",0.8,122,walm
"Based on the context provided by the examples, the term ""walm"" appears to function as an instruction to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it multiple times. The number of repetitions isn't always consistent in number but is at least twice or more. Let's analyze the examples to determine the specific rule:

- In the first example, ""dax lug dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue green blue blue blue."" Here, the walm follows the word ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" and outputs ""blue"" two additional times.

- In the second example, ""dax wif walm lug zup"" becomes ""green red red red blue yellow."" The word ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""red,"" which is then repeated two additional times.

- In the third example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red."" Again, ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" which is repeated twice since it only occurs once before the ""walm.""

- In the fourth example, ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue blue blue green red red green."" ""Lug"" precedes ""walm,"" so ""blue"" is repeated twice more.

- The fifth example is identical to the third, ""wif walm"" becoming ""red red red,"" reinforcing the pattern of the word ""wif"" being repeated twice after ""walm.""

Rule: ""walm"" -> When walm appears, it means to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before it two additional times, unless the preceding word/color does not appear in the sequence before ""walm,"" in which case, repeat the color only twice in total. (For example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" not ""red red red red,"" as ""wif"" occurs only once before ""walm"").",0.8,122,walm
"Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to be a modifier that repeats the color associated with the preceding word. Here's how the rule applies to the examples:

1. In the first example, ""dax lug dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue green blue blue blue."" This coincides with ""lug"" being ""blue"" and ""walm"" repeating ""blue"" twice, matching the number of words preceding it.

2. In the second example, ""dax wif walm lug zup"" results in ""green red red red blue yellow."" Here, ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times, for the three words (""dax wif walm"") before ""lug.""

3. The third example, ""wif walm,"" leads to ""red red red."" It suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color ""red"" associated with ""wif"" two additional times.

4. The fourth example, ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax,"" outputs ""green blue blue blue green red red green."" ""Lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and ""walm"" again repeats ""blue"" three times. The pattern continues with subsequent words changing to their associated colors.

5. Finally, the fifth example, ""wif walm,"" is identical to the third and similarly results in ""red red red,"" with ""walm"" repeating ""red"" twice following a single ""wif.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""wif"", we need to examine each instance where ""wif"" appears in the input and the corresponding output.

- In the first input ""wif bluf"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" as the output is ""red red"" and ""bluf"" would consistently mean ""red"" as well (from comparing to other examples).
- In the second input, ""lug walm wif zup wif"", ""wif"" appears twice and corresponds to ""red"" both times, as the output ""blue blue blue red yellow red"" suggests when ""lug"" is consistent with ""blue"", ""walm"" with ""blue"", and ""zup"" with ""yellow"" from other examples.
- In the third input ""wif zup walm dax zup"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again, as shown in the output ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow"", and the other words match their color outputs noted previously.
- In the fourth input ""lug walm wif bluf"", ""wif"" also corresponds to ""red"", seen from the output ""blue blue blue red red"".
- In the fifth input ""dax wif lug dax"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" once more, demonstrated by the output ""green red blue green"".

5. ""dax wif lug dax"" translates to ""green red blue green,"" where ""dax"" is consistent with ""green,"" and ""wif"" is consistent with ""red,"" while ""lug"" is associated with ""blue.""

- Example 4: ""lug walm wif bluf"" maps to ""blue blue blue red red."" This example supports the hypothesis since ""lug"" and ""walm"" are blue, ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" seems to stand for red as well.
- Example 5: ""dax wif lug dax"" maps to ""green red blue green."" Once again, ""wif"" is associated with red.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,123,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we will look for patterns associated with its surroundings and outputs:

1. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
2. Input: lug walm wif zup wif -> Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
3. Input: wif zup walm dax zup -> Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
4. Input: lug walm wif bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red red
5. Input: dax wif lug dax -> Output: green red blue green

After examining the patterns, we can make the following observations:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, ""red"" is part of the output. 
- ""wif"" doesn't always result in just one instance of ""red""; sometimes, it's followed by another color (examples 1 and 4).
- The second color that follows ""red"" when ""wif"" is used seems to be determined by the word that comes after ""wif"". For example:
  a. wif bluf -> red red
  b. wif [zup wif] -> red yellow red
  c. wif [lug] -> red blue

Based on these observations, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be that it translates to ""red,"" but it might also dictate that the following word is translated directly after the red without any transformation.

So let's check the second color directly after ""wif"" in each instance:

- In examples 2 and 3, ""zup"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""yellow"" for zup.
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red"" for bluf, which is the same as ""wif"".
- In the last example, ""lug"" follows ""wif"" and the output ""blue"" follows ""red"".

Given these patterns, the meaning of ""wif"" could be interpreted as indicating ""red,"" with the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red (and possibly enforce the next word to be translated directly after ""red""). However, there are inconsistencies with the enforcement part of the rule, so additional examples may be needed to further refine the rule.",0.7,123,wif

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"".
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"".
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"".

Observe that ""bluf"" appears between ""dax"" and other colors, and in the third input, it appears alone with ""dax"". In all cases with ""bluf"", ""dax"" precedes it, and no additional word causes any additional color in the output sequence. This consistency, regardless of the position of ""bluf"" (whether it's followed by another word or not), indicates that ""bluf"" itself does not correspond to a new color but rather is a repetition indicator for the preceding color, which in this case is always ""green"" associated with ""dax"".

Furthermore, when ""bluf"" appears without the word ""dax"" before it, such as in the last input, it doesn't produce any additional color in the output, confirming the idea that it acts in relation to the word that precedes it (which needs to be ""dax"" in the given examples).

"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that ""walm"" represents a repetition of the preceding color word three times in the output. Analyzing the given data:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"".
- In the third example, ""wif walm"" still results in ""red red red"", even when another color word ""bluf"" (yellow) precedes ""wif"".
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" comes after ""dax"", and in the output, this results in ""green green green"".
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" and is consistent even when it is repeated, implying that the rule applies whenever ""walm"" is used after a color word.

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

"walm -> meaning. Based on the examples, ""walm"" seems to repeatedly result in the output of a color repeated three times.

"walm -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""walm"" appears to be the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word that comes immediately before ""walm."" The number of repetitions is three times.

"Reviewing the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three additional times.

Here are the rules that we can induce:

1. ""lug"" correlates to the color blue.
2. ""wif"" correlates to the color red.
3. ""zup"" correlates to the color yellow.
4. ""dax"" correlates to the color green.
5. ""bluf"" correlates to the color yellow (based on the third example given).

When ""walm"" follows these words, the output color is repeated three additional times:

- In ""lug walm,"" blue is repeated three more times (blue blue blue blue).
- In ""wif walm,"" red is repeated three more times (red red red red).
- In ""bluf wif walm,"" we see yellow from ""bluf,"" then red from ""wif,"" followed by three more reds from ""walm"" (yellow red red red red).
- In ""dax walm zup lug,"" green is repeated twice more (since ""zup"" interrupts the pattern) from ""walm"" after the initial green from ""dax"" (green green green yellow blue).
- In ""lug walm zup lug walm,"" the pattern begins with blue from ""lug,"" followed by three blues from the first ""walm,"" then it resets with yellow from ""zup,"" followed by blue from the second ""lug"" and three more blues from the second ""walm"" (blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue).

- When preceded by ""wif"" (which corresponds to the color red), ""walm"" results in ""red red red.""
- When preceded by ""bluf"" (which corresponds to the color yellow), ""walm"" results in ""red red red"" because ""bluf"" was followed by ""wif"" which changed the color to red.

- zup bluf -> blue
- wif bluf -> blue
- bluf dax -> green

Thus the word ""bluf"" doesn't have a fixed meaning, but its meaning changes depending on whether it is preceded by the word ""dax"" or not.",1.0,124,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns based on the given input and output pairings:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
2. Whenever ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue.""
3. Whenever ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""
4. Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""

Now let's focus on ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" maps to ""green green red blue yellow."" Since we know the colors for ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup,"" we can deduce that ""bluf"" maps to ""green"" here because the second occurrence of ""green"" has no other word that could correspond to it.
- In the second example, ""zup bluf dax lug"" maps to ""yellow yellow green blue."" Since we know that ""zup,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" map to ""yellow,"" ""green,"" and ""blue"" respectively, it appears that ""bluf"" in this context maps to the color ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""dax bluf"" maps to ""green green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" could map to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" maps to ""green blue yellow red red green."" Before and after ""bluf,"" there is ""wif"" and ""dax,"" which are ""red"" and ""green"" respectively. Since ""wif"" is mapped to ""red,"" ""bluf"" in this case maps to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug bluf dax lug"" maps to ""blue blue green blue."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" This could suggest ""bluf"" maps to ""blue,"" but it is following a ""lug"" that's already mapped to ""blue.""

From these examples, we see that ""bluf"" seems to match the color immediately preceding it. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it's ""green."" When it follows ""lug,"" it's ""blue,"" and so forth.

Rule: bluf -> The same color as the color-word immediately preceding it.",1.0,124,bluf
"From the examples provided, we can deduce the possible meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by looking for patterns that correlate with the output.

1. In the first example, ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" translates to ""green green red blue yellow.""
2. In the second example, ""zup bluf dax lug"" becomes ""yellow yellow green blue.""
3. In the third example, ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green.""
4. In the fourth example, ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue yellow red red green.""
5. In the fifth example, ""lug bluf dax lug"" yields ""blue blue green blue.""

Based on these examples, when the word ""bluf"" appears, the word that immediately follows it (""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""zup"") is assigned the same color that was assigned to ""bluf"" (e.g., ""bluf wif"" results in ""green red,"" but ""wif"" is elsewhere associated with red). When ""bluf"" is the last word, it repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it (""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"").

It seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word immediately to its left if it is at the end of the input sequence, or causes the next word to repeat the color value of ""bluf"" if it is not at the end.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the next word to repeat the color of ""bluf."" If ""bluf"" is the final word in the sequence, then it repeats the color of the word directly before it.",1.0,124,bluf
"bluf -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,124,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns and what colors correspond to it in each example:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""

It appears that ""bluf"" does not consistently correspond to a specific color. Instead, its output seems to depend on the context of other words present. To determine the rule that dictates the color associated with ""bluf,"" let's pay attention to the position of ""bluf"" relative to ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup"":

- When ""bluf"" immediately follows ""dax,"" the output for ""bluf"" is the same color as the output for ""dax"" (green).
- When ""bluf"" immediately follows ""lug,"" the output for ""bluf"" is the same color as the output for ""lug"" (blue).
- When ""bluf"" immediately follows ""wif,"" which only happens in the first example, the output for ""bluf"" is the same color as the output for ""wif"" (red).
- There is no instance where ""bluf"" immediately follows ""zup,"" so we do not have enough information to determine the outcome in that context.

From these observations, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" in this context is that it functions as a color mimic for the preceding word.

bluf -> meaning: The color of the word that immediately precedes ""bluf.""",1.0,124,bluf
"walm -> repeating the color that comes before it two more times

Rule: When the ""walm"" term is used, it repeats the color word that precedes it twice, effectively creating three instances of that color in a sequence.

If ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" three times.",1.0,124,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. The repetition appears to be one additional time beyond the initial mention. Whenever ""walm"" is mentioned after a word, the color assigned to that word is stated twice subsequently. 

Here is the breakdown:

1. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue green blue blue blue""
- The word ""lug"" which denotes ""blue"" is followed by ""walm"". So, ""blue"" appears twice after that point instead of once.

2. ""wif zup walm dax zup"" leads to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow""
- The word ""zup"" which denotes ""yellow"" is followed by ""walm"". So, ""yellow"" appears three times in a row.

3. ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green""
- The word ""dax"" which denotes ""green"" is followed by ""walm"". So, ""green"" is repeated twice after its initial mention.

4. ""dax walm wif"" leads to ""green green green red""
- The ""green"" repeats twice after ""dax"" due to ""walm"". Then ""wif"" which denotes ""red"" is not affected by ""walm"".

5. ""lug walm wif bluf"" leads to ""blue blue blue red red""
- The word ""lug"" which denotes ""blue"" is followed by ""walm"" resulting in ""blue"" being stated thrice in a row. ""wif"" denotes ""red"" which then follows in its normal sequence, though ""bluf"" is not given in the examples and does not have an established color; it is assumed to follow the pattern with ""red red"".

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the immediately preceding word to be repeated once more than its initial mention.",1.0,124,walm
"Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the last mentioned color as many times as the number of letters in ""walm"".

Here's how this rule applies to each example:

Example 1: ""dax lug dax lug walm""
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
So ""walm"", following this pattern with ""lug"" (blue) being the last color, should result in ""blue"" being repeated four times (since ""walm"" has four letters).

Output: green blue green blue blue blue
This fits with the given output for example 1.

Example 2: ""wif zup walm dax zup""
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
Following the last color which is ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" would result in ""yellow"" repeated four times because ""walm"" has four letters.

Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
This fits the given output for example 2.

Example 3: ""dax walm""
- dax -> green
According to the rule, ""walm"" should be ""green"" repeated four times.

Output: green green green
This fits with the given output for the example, although it's worth noting that the output contains only three greens, not four, which might indicate that the rule has some variance or the given output may contain an error.

Example 4: ""dax walm wif""
- dax -> green
- ""walm"" -> green repeated four times
- wif -> red

Output: green green green red
This aligns with the output given for this example as well.

Example 5: ""lug walm wif bluf""
- lug -> blue
- ""walm"" -> blue repeated four times
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red

Output: blue blue blue red red
This fits with the output given for this example.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last mentioned color as many times as there are letters in ""walm"", which is four.",0.8,124,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that walm results in repeating the color of the previous word or phrase an additional two times. In each instance, the word that accompanies ""walm"" has a corresponding color, which is then placed in the output sequence two extra times.

Here’s the breakdown of the examples to show the pattern:

- The sequence ""dax lug dax lug walm"" correlates to ""green blue green blue green green,"" but the output given is ""green blue green blue blue blue."" ""Walm"" follows the word ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, and then we see ""blue blue"" an additional two times.
   
- In the sequence ""wif zup walm dax zup,"" ""wif"" is red, and ""zup"" is yellow. ""Walm"" comes after ""zup,"" and the output for yellow is extended by two, creating ""yellow yellow."" Then it continues with ""green yellow"" matching ""dax zup"" respectively.

- For ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" is green, and then we see ""green green"" after ""walm.""

- In the sequence ""dax walm wif,"" we have ""green"" for ""dax,"" which is then repeated two more times for ""walm,"" followed by ""red"" for ""wif.""

- In the sequence ""lug walm wif bluf,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" which is repeated two extra times for ""walm,"" followed by ""red red"" for ""wif bluf.""

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated twice.
- When ""walm"" is followed by another word, the output repeats the color associated with ""walm"" once more and then continues with the next color as per the next word.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,125,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

In each instance where the nonce word ""zup"" is used, regardless of context or surrounding words, the output is consistently ""yellow"". This indicates that ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow"".",1.0,125,zup
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to the word ""red"" when it is preceded by the word ""wif,"" and it translates to ""blue"" when it is preceded by ""lug"" or ""zup."" There isn’t an example showing ""bluf"" standing alone or following ""dax"" or ""walm,"" so it is unknown what ""bluf"" would mean in those cases. 

The rule seems to be context-dependent, specifically on the word that comes before ""bluf."" Here is the interpretation of the rule:

Rule: If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" it means ""red."" If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" or ""zup,"" it means ""blue.""",1.0,125,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately follows it. When ""bluf"" is the last word, it defaults to the color blue. Let's analyze the patterns:

1. ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red red green blue blue"". Notice that ""bluf"" came after ""wif"" and was translated as ""red"", and after ""dax"" translated to ""green"". When ""bluf"" is the last word, it becomes ""blue"".

2. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and is translated as ""blue"", so it isn't taking the color of the following word, but has its own associated color.

3. ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green"". ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and translates as ""red"".

4. ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" translates to ""yellow red red yellow blue"". Again, ""bluf"" after ""wif"" is ""red"".

5. ""zup lug bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue blue"". ""Bluf"" is last and hence is ""blue"".

Taking all examples into consideration, we notice that ""bluf"" is most consistently followed by a color word that matches the color of the previous word. Nonetheless, the second example seems to be an outlier or has a ""bluf"" that simply means ""blue"" without following the aforementioned rule.

Considering the outlier, the simplest and most consistent rule across other examples is that ""bluf"" takes on the color stated right before it, and if it's the last word with no color following, it defaults to blue.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word right before it; if it's the last word, it defaults to blue.",0.8,125,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red when preceded by wif, blue otherwise.",0.8,125,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to correspond to the color ""blue"" in the output. Here is the breakdown according to the given input-output pairs:

Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""bluf"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""
Output: blue red red green blue blue
- It confirms that ""bluf"" is ""blue,"" as ""lug"" is also ""blue.""

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" to ""blue,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: wif bluf dax
- ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""bluf"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""
Output: red red green
- ""Bluf"" is in the position of the second color, which is ""red,"" indicating that its meaning might be context-dependent.

Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""bluf"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
Output: yellow red red yellow blue
- Here, it seems like ""bluf"" means ""red"" based on its position after ""wif,"" which also means ""red.""

Input: zup lug bluf
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" to ""blue.""
Output: yellow blue blue
- ""Bluf"" aligns with ""blue"" again.

The initial assumption that ""bluf"" correlates directly to ""blue"" contradicts the third example, where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red."" However, after reviewing all the examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> duplicates the color of the preceding word. If there is no word before ""bluf"" or if it's the first in the sequence, it defaults to ""blue.""",0.8,125,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" means ""red."" When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" it follows the color of ""wif,"" which is red. In all other contexts, ""bluf"" translates to the same color as the word immediately preceding it. If ""bluf"" is the first word, it defaults to blue.

bluf -> red when preceded by ""wif""
bluf -> same color as the word immediately preceding it in all other contexts
bluf -> defaults to blue if it is the first word",0.2,125,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns where the word appears and the corresponding outputs.

In the first example, we have:

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

In this sequence, ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and the output for ""lug"" is blue but after ""walm"" it becomes green before returning to blue again for ""lug."" Therefore, ""walm"" prompted a change from blue to green, but only for a single position. It is followed by ""dax"" which corresponds to green. 

In the second example:

Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue

The word ""walm"" appears at the end and the output becomes a repetition of the word before it, ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue. Here, ""walm"" seems to double the output value that comes before it.

In the third example:

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red

After ""walm"" the color green is repeated, but it's the same color as the input before ""walm,"" which is ""dax,"" represented by green.

In the fourth example:

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

Here ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color green is repeated again twice after ""walm"" appears. 

In the fifth example:

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

In this case, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" and then ""zup."" After ""walm,"" like in example 1 and 3, the color green appears. But it's not a simple repetition of the previous color (yellow, from ""zup""), and instead follows the color corresponding to ""dax.""

Considering these patterns, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the output to change to the color green for the position that follows it, regardless of what the input word is. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be defined as:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, the output color for the next position is green. 

So:

walm -> meaning. Rule: The following item produces the output green.",1.0,125,walm
"Analyzing the examples provided, we can infer the following:

- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" or ""red"" (not completely clear but not relevant to the nonce word ""walm"")

In each instance where ""walm"" occurs, the sequence of the output colors involves repeated ""green"" followed by ""blue"". More specifically:

- If ""dax lug"" (green blue) appears, and we have ""walm"" following ""dax"" but before ""lug"", ""walm"" is associated with two ""blue"" colors in the output.
- If ""walm"" appears elsewhere, it involves a repetition of the color ""green"" in the output.

From these observations, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" occurs, it repeats the color of the word before it until the color ""blue"" is reached.

Thus, the meaning can be stated as:

walm -> Repeat the preceding color until the color ""blue"" appears in the sequence.",0.9,125,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the corresponding outputs for each occurrence of the word ""walm"" in the given examples.

In the first example:
Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

""walm"" corresponds to the sequence ""blue blue.""

In the second example:
Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue

Here ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue"" once again.

In the third example:
Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red

""walm"" corresponds to ""green green"" this time.

In the fourth example:
Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

""walm"" corresponds to ""green green"" here as well.

In the fifth example:
Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow green.""

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color that immediately precedes it in the output. For example, if the color before ""walm"" is ""blue,"" the output is ""blue blue,"" if it is ""green,"" the output is ""green green,"" and if it is ""yellow,"" the output is ""yellow green.""

However, the last example partially contradicts our findings since ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow green"" rather than ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting that there may be more to the rule, such as an extra condition or context specificity.

Given the evidence from other examples, where consistency is observed except in the last instance, a comprehensive rule cannot be clearly defined. We would require additional examples or information to iron out any exceptions or to determine if ""yellow"" uniquely alters the pattern.

Thus, based on the limited but mostly consistent information from the examples provided, we can define the rule as:
Rule: ""walm"" -> repeats the output color that immediately precedes it, with a possible unique condition or additional rule for when the preceding color is ""yellow.""",0.8,125,walm
"Analyzing the examples given, we can infer the meaning or the rule for the word ""walm"" by looking at the patterns in the input and their respective outputs.

Observations:

1. Whenever ""walm"" appears, it is followed by ""green"" colors in the output.
2. The number of ""green"" colors following ""walm"" seems to be dependent on the number of ""dax"" and/or ""lug"" words that come after it in the input.

Now, let's examine each example to extract the rule:

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug  
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue  
- Here ""walm"" is followed by a ""green"" and then a ""blue.""

Input: dax lug dax lug walm  
Output: green blue green blue blue blue  
- Here ""walm"" is followed by two ""blue"" colors.

Input: zup dax walm zup wif  
Output: yellow green green green yellow red  
- Here ""walm"" is followed by two ""green"" colors.

Input: wif bluf dax walm  
Output: red red green green green  
- Here ""walm"" is followed by three ""green"" colors.

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif  
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red  
- Here ""walm"" is followed by one ""green"" color.

From the above observations, we notice that ""walm"" predicts the occurrence of ""green"" in the output. Specifically, we can deduce that ""walm"" predicts ""green"" appearances equivalent to the number of subsequent ""dax"" (each ""dax"" seems to correspond to a single ""green"" color).

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as:

Rule: ""walm"" -> For each ""dax"" after ""walm,"" output a ""green."" If there are no ""dax"" words after ""walm,"" then ""walm"" is followed by a ""blue.""

According to this rule, ""walm"" indicates a sequence where ""green"" appears equal to the count of ""dax"" words coming after it, and in the absence of ""dax,"" a ""blue"" follows.",0.8,125,walm
"Rule: walm -> The output color for the nonce word ""walm"" is green, repeated the number of times the word prior to ""walm"" appears in the sequence up until that point.

Let's verify the rule with each example:

Example 1: 
Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Here, the word before ""walm"" is ""lug"", which appears once before walm.
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
As per our rule, ""walm"" translates to ""blue"", and it is repeating once because ""lug"" appears only once before it.

Example 2:
Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Here, the word before ""walm"" is ""lug"", which occurs twice before ""walm"".
Output: green blue green blue blue blue
As per our rule, ""walm"" translates to ""blue"" repeated twice because ""lug"" appears twice before it.

Example 3: 
Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Here, the word before ""walm"" is ""dax"", which occurs once before ""walm"".
Output: yellow green green green yellow red
As per our rule, ""walm"" translates to ""green"", repeated once because ""dax"" appears once before it.

Example 4:
Input: wif bluf dax walm
Here, the word before ""walm"" is ""dax"", which occurs once before ""walm"".
Output: red red green green green
As per our rule, ""walm"" translates to ""green"", repeated once because ""dax"" appears once before it. 

Example 5:
Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Here, the word before ""walm"" is ""zup"", which occurs once before ""walm"".
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
As per our rule, ""walm"" translates to ""yellow"", repeated once because ""zup"" appears once before it.

Therefore:

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Every instance where ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Also, when ""dax"" appears alone, the output is solely ""green.""

"dax -> green. Rule: When the word 'dax' appears in the input, the corresponding output is always 'green'.",1.0,126,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following:

1. ""zup wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red red red"". Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""walm"" must then be ""red"".
2. ""wif"" on its own corresponds to ""red"".
3. ""lug zup wif zup"" corresponds to ""blue yellow red yellow"". Thus, ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""zup"" is confirmed again as ""yellow"".
4. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue red green"". Based on previous examples, ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""walm"" is ""red"" and therefore ""dax"" must be ""green"".
5. ""wif zup"" corresponds to ""red yellow"". This supports ""zup"" being ""yellow"".

We can determine that regardless of position, ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output sequence. Therefore, the rule appears to be that the word ""wif"" stands for the color red in this context.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,126,wif
"From the given examples, we can infer the following:
- The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red.""
- It doesn’t appear to change based on context or position within the input list.
- Other words in the examples (""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""lug,"" ""dax"") correspond to different colors and these colors appear to remain consistent regardless of their position related to ""wif.""

Given these observations, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color regardless of context. Specifically:

wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" is associated with the color red.",1.0,126,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds with the color ""red."" Let's verify this by examining each example:

- Input: zup wif walm | Output: yellow red red red
  - ""zup"" might correspond to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" could potentially be repeating the color ""red"" or leading to a pattern of repetition.

- Input: wif | Output: red
  - ""wif"" is presented alone and produces ""red,"" which supports our initial hypothesis.

- Input: lug zup wif zup | Output: blue yellow red yellow
  - Here, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" which is consistent with our rule.

- Input: zup lug walm wif dax | Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
  - If ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""walm"" induces repetition of ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""dax"" introduces the color ""green.""

- Input: wif zup | Output: red yellow
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" which aligns with our previous assessments.

These observations support the rule:
wif -> red.",1.0,126,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can observe the following correlations:

- In all instances where the word ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" also appears in the output.
- The word ""wif"" seems to be independent of its position in the input sequence, as it always results in ""red,"" whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end of the input.
- When ""wif"" is by itself as an input, the output is solely ""red,"" which suggests that ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red.""

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red

This means that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""",1.0,126,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following:

1. Whenever the word ""wif"" appears, the output consistently includes ""red.""
2. ""Wif"" does not seem to modify the color attributed to other words, as seen by the recurring colors for ""zup"" (yellow) and ""lug"" (blue) regardless of ""wif""'s position.

Thus, the rule seems to be that the word ""wif"" is directly translated to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,126,wif
"Based on the examples given, the rule for the word ""zup"" can be induced as follows:

When ""zup"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow."" It does not matter where ""zup"" appears in the sequence or what other words are in the sequence; whenever ""zup"" is in the input, the output will always include ""yellow.""

Therefore, the meaning assigned to ""zup"" in this context is the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,126,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" consistently in each example. It does not seem to be affected by position or the presence of other words. Therefore, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,126,zup
"Based on the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of the other words (which denote other colors) in each input. This conclusion is supported by the instances where ""zup"" is the only word in the input or is included with other words, and the corresponding output is always ""yellow"" aligned with the position of ""zup"" in the input.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,126,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow' in each case. It does not appear to change its meaning based on position or surrounding words. Therefore, the rule seems quite straightforward.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,126,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following associations for each nonce word:

- dax -> green
- bluf -> green
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- walm -> yellow

When ""zup"" appears in the input sequences, the output is consistently yellow, regardless of its position or the context provided by other words. Therefore, it stands to reason that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,126,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs, looking for patterns:

Input: dax lug wif bluf
Output: green blue red red

Input: wif zup bluf
Output: red yellow yellow

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

From these inputs and outputs, we can observe that ""bluf"" does not correspond to a single color. Instead, its representation in the output seems dependent on the preceding words. Let's analyze the outputs that follow ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by red, despite ""wif"" being before ""bluf"" and corresponding to ""red"" in the output.
- In the second, third, and fourth examples, ""bluf"" is followed by yellow twice within the same output, suggesting a repeat of the color that comes directly before ""bluf.""
- The fifth example again shows ""bluf"" being followed by yellow, which is the color corresponding to ""zup,"" the word that comes directly before ""bluf.""

Given this information, we can infer that ""bluf"" corresponds to the repetition of the color mentioned right before it in the sequence. Therefore, ""bluf"" results in the same color as the word that comes directly before it.

Rule: bluf -> The color that is represented by the word directly before ""bluf.""",1.0,126,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the last unique color mentioned. If the last unique color word is ""dax,"" the output is green. If the last unique color word is ""wif,"" the output is red. If the last unique color word is ""lug,"" the output is blue. If the last unique color word is ""zup,"" the output is yellow. ""Bluf"" takes the color of the last color mentioned before it, disregarding any repetitions.

Therefore: bluf -> the color of the last unique color word mentioned before it.",1.0,126,bluf
"From the provided examples, it seems that every time the nonce word ""bluf"" appears, the output is a specific color. Taking each instance where ""bluf"" appears, I am observing the following outputs:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" which translates to red, however the output is ""red.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" which translates to yellow, and the output is ""yellow.""
- In the third example, the ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"" which translates to green, but the output is ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is after ""zup"" (yellow) again, and the output is ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" (blue) and the output is ""blue.""

Considering these examples, ""bluf"" seems to mirror the color of the word that precedes it, not the color associated with ""bluf"" itself (since it doesn't have a consistent direct translation).

Thus, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> The color output of ""bluf"" is the same as the color output of the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,126,bluf
"Analyzing the given examples, we observe the following:

Input: dax lug wif bluf  
Output: green blue red red  
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.

Input: wif zup bluf  
Output: red yellow yellow  
- Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, but following the previous pattern, the word ""bluf"" should have resulted in ""red"". This indicates ""bluf"" may change based on its position or other words around it.

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf  
Output: red green yellow red green green  
- In this example, ""bluf"" appears to correspond with ""green"" in the output.

Input: dax zup bluf  
Output: green yellow yellow  
- Here, as in the second example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug  
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue  
- In this example, rather than matching to ""blue"" as might be expected given its position between two ""yellow"" colors, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" as well.

From the above examples, it is not immediately apparent what specific rule ""bluf"" follows, as its output isn't consistently the same color. However, one pattern that emerges is that ""bluf"" always corresponds to the color that the word before it translates to:

- In the first example, the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" Thus, ""bluf"" is ""red.""
- In the second example, the word before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" Therefore, ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""
- In the third example, the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" As such, ""bluf"" is ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and is therefore ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" also follows ""zup"" and is again ""yellow.""

Rule:\
bluf -> The color corresponding to ""bluf"" is the same as the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it in the input sequence.",1.0,126,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to discern a pattern that links the input words and their corresponding color outputs. Here's what we have:

1. dax -> green
2. lug -> blue
3. wif -> red
4. zup -> yellow
5. bluf -> ?

Looking at the position of ""bluf"" in the sequence and the output that follows, we can observe the following:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output color is red. For example, ""dax lug wif bluf"" results in ""green blue red red,"" and ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" results in ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue.""
  
  However, in the example ""zup lug zup bluf lug,"" the word ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" but the corresponding colors are ""yellow blue"" and not red. Thus, we cannot say that ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" means the color red based on this example alone.

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output color is green. For example, ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" results in ""red green yellow red green green,"" and ""dax zup bluf"" results in ""green yellow yellow.""

- When the word ""bluf"" occurs, it seems to take the color value of the word immediately preceding it, effectively repeating the last color mentioned. Here's how it aligns with the examples:

  1. ""dax lug wif bluf"" -> ""green blue red red"" (bluf takes the color of wif, which is red)
  2. ""wif zup bluf"" -> ""red yellow yellow"" (bluf takes the color of zup, which is yellow)
  3. ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green yellow red green green"" (bluf takes the color of dax, which is green)
  4. ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow"" (bluf takes the color of zup, which is yellow)
  5. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue"" (bluf takes the color of zup, which is yellow)

Therefore, ""bluf"" appears to replicate the color of the word that precedes it. The rule of ""bluf"" is:

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color of the word immediately before it.",1.0,126,bluf
"Rule: walm -> the color of the previous word repeated. If there is no previous word, walm is red.",1.0,126,walm
"From the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" is used to generate a sequence of the color red. However, the number of times red is generated seems dependent on the terms presented before ""walm."" To understand how the rule applies, let's break down the evidence from each input and its matching output:

1. Input: ""zup dax lug walm zup""
   Output: ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow""
   - The sequence is ""blue"" repeated three times after ""lug"" and before ""zup.""

2. Input: ""lug wif walm""
   Output: ""blue red red red""
   - The rule generates ""red"" three times following ""wif.""

3. Input: ""zup wif walm""
   Output: ""yellow red red red""
   - The rule generates ""red"" three times following ""wif,"" irrespective of the presence of ""zup.""

4. Input: ""wif walm""
   Output: ""red red red""
   - Without any color-indicating term before ""wif,"" ""red"" is still repeated three times.

5. Input: ""lug walm wif lug bluf""
   Output: ""blue blue blue red blue blue""
   - The presence of ""lug"" generates ""blue"" twice before indications of ""red"" and once after ""wif.""

Based on these observations, we can assert the following:
- ""walm"" signifies the repetition of the color ""red.""
- The number of ""red"" repetitions seems to be exactly three, irrespective of preceding words.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" could be stated as:
- Rule: walm -> ""red"" repeated three times",1.0,126,walm
"Rule: walm -> output is the color corresponding to the preceding word repeated as many times as walm is used consecutively.

Explanation:
- In the first input, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color blue. ""Walm"" is used once, so the output is ""blue"" once, followed by the color corresponding to ""zup"" which is yellow.
  
- In the second input, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red. ""Walm"" is used once, so the output is ""red"" once.
  
- In the third input, ""walm"" again follows ""wif,"" and the output is one additional red following the red corresponding to ""wif.""

- In the fourth input, ""walm"" is by itself but since it generally follows ""wif"" in other examples, it might be assumed that it defaults to the last mentioned color, which is red (from the input ""wif""). Hence, there are three reds as ""walm"" continues to follow ""wif.""

- In the fifth input, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and therefore the output is blue, repeated for the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned, which is once in this case. The rest of the colors follow the color represented by their corresponding word.

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to function as a repetition indicator for the color of the word preceding it.",1.0,126,walm
Rule: walm -> repeat the color word before it.,1.0,126,walm
"To deduce the meaning or rule of the word ""walm,"" we will look at the given examples and try to identify patterns or associations that can guide us.

In the first example, when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the word ""blue"" is repeated three times in the output (lug walm -> blue blue blue). 

In the second and third examples, we again see that following ""wif"" with ""walm"" results in three instances of ""red"" (wif walm -> red red red).

In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" on its own also yields ""red red red,"" which suggests that ""walm"" by itself continues the color of the word before it multiple times.

In the fifth example, we see ""lug walm wif"" results in ""blue blue blue red,"" where ""walm"" after ""lug"" continued the color ""blue"" before ""wif"" changed the color to ""red.""

From these observations, we can surmise that the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color associated with the previous word three times. Therefore:

Rule: When following another color word, ""walm"" repeats the color associated with that word three times.

Based on this rule:

walm -> meaning: repeat the color of the previous word three times.",0.9,126,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" Each time the word ""lug"" is used, the color blue appears in the output in the corresponding position. Here's how it plays out across the examples:

1. ""lug walm zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow red""
2. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
3. ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red""
4. ""lug zup dax wif zup"" -> ""blue yellow green red yellow""
5. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""

"Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the given examples, every time the nonce word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" is included in the output. There is a one-to-one correspondence between ""lug"" and ""blue,"" regardless of the position of ""lug"" within the input string or the presence of other words. Therefore, we can conclude that ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""",1.0,127,lug
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" appears consistently mentioned in the input and corresponding to the color 'blue' in the output. Additionally, the presence of ""lug"" appears to alter the output color sequence of following words until another ""lug"" appears. The rule can be deduced as follows:

- ""lug"" directly corresponds to the color 'blue'.
- After the appearance of ""lug"", the following words correspond to the color ""red"" until another ""lug"" is encountered, where the pattern could reset based on the relative frequency of ""lug"".

From the examples provided:

- In example 1, ""lug"" is responsible for the first 'blue', and it seems to cause all subsequent words to be 'red'. However, when ""wif"" is the next word after ""lug"", it results in 'yellow' instead.
  
- In example 2, ""lug"" outputs 'blue', with one instance causing subsequent words to turn to 'red', but not when ""dax"" is present; ""dax"" outputs 'green'.
  
- In example 3, ""lug"" once again is 'blue', and all subsequent words are 'red'.

- In example 4, ""lug"" is 'blue', and it follows the same pattern causing subsequent words to be 'red' until reset.

- In example 5, ""lug"" is 'blue', and it flips words to 'red' following the pattern.

Considering that ""walm"" is consistently 'red' after ""lug"" and ""wif"" is 'yellow' following ""lug"", ""zup"" changes from yellow to red in the presence of ""lug"" before it, and that ""lug dax lug"" yields 'blue green blue', here is the interpreted rule:

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color 'blue' and when placed before other nonce words, it turns them into 'red', with the exception of ""dax"" which becomes 'green' and ""wif"" which becomes 'yellow'. If another ""lug"" appears, it outputs 'blue' and potentially resets the alteration effects it has on the subsequent words.",0.8,127,lug
Rule: dax -> green.,1.0,127,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,127,dax
"Based on the provided examples, dax corresponds to the color green. Thus, the rule is:

dax -> green.",1.0,127,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word corresponds to a specific color. Here is the inferred mapping:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow (presumed since it outputs the same color as zup and walm)

Additionally, ""dax"" seems to come between two other words and maps to ""green."" Consistency check:

- In the first and third examples, ""dax"" is surrounded by ""wif"" and the output is ""red green red"".
- In the second example, ""dax"" comes after ""wif"" and before ""zup,"" resulting in ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" comes before ""zup"" with no word preceding it, leading to ""green yellow yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" comes after ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow green.""

Thus, it matches all outputs where ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of the words that come before or after it.

"dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,127,dax
"Based on the examples given, it appears that each word in the input is assigned a specific color in the output, with ""wif"" consistently resulting in the color red, no matter its position in the sequence. Hence, we can deduce:

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word within an input corresponds to a particular color in the output. Specifically focusing on the nonce word ""wif,"" in every instance it is present in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,127,wif
"Based on the provided examples, ""wif"" always corresponds to the output ""red."" There is no variation in the output related to the presence of the word ""wif.""

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" produces ""green green green"", with ""dax"" being associated with ""green"" and ""walm"" causing it to repeat twice more.
- In the second example, ""lug walm wif lug"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue"", where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". ""Walm"" here would cause ""blue"" to repeat twice more after the initial ""blue"".
- In the third example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"", indicating that ""wif"" is associated with ""red"" and ""walm"" causes the repetition.
- In the fourth example, ""dax lug walm"" turns into ""green blue blue blue"". Here ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"", hence ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- In the last example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" is converted to ""yellow yellow red red red"". ""Bluf"" appears to correspond to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red"", so after ""wif"" comes ""walm"", causing ""red"" to repeat.

"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" correlates with repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. To verify this, let's analyze the given examples one by one.

1. Input: dax walm

   - ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" followed by ""walm,"" which results in ""green"" being repeated three times.

2. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   - ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" followed by ""walm,"" which results in ""blue"" being repeated three times, then ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and finally ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" again.

3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" followed by ""walm,"" which results in ""red"" being repeated three times.

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" leads to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and ""walm"" results in ""red"" being repeated three times.

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems consistent:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the color associated with that word is repeated three times in the output.

Therefore:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,127,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with a color repeated three times in the output. The specific color that follows ""walm"" appears to correlate with the color of the word immediately preceding it. Here is the pattern deduced from the examples:

- When ""lug"" comes before ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
- When ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" the output is ""red"" repeated three times.
- When ""zup"" and ""bluf"" precede ""wif"" before ""walm,"" it retains the output of ""red"" repeated three times corresponding to ""wif.""

"Based on the examples given, each instance of ""wif"" generates two instances of ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> two reds",1.0,128,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" signals the repetition of the color associated with the subsequent word. Here's how the rule applies in each given example:

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" meaning ""walm"" is associated with ""red,"" and ""wif"" signals that this color is repeated three times.
  
- In the second example, ""wif lug"" outputs ""red blue,"" so ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" before it means ""red"" is mentioned before ""blue,"" but only once because ""lug"" appears only once.

- In the third example, ""wif walm zup walm"" outputs ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" is still associated with ""red,"" and it appears twice after ""wif"" so ""red"" is mentioned three times in a row. ""Zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" which is repeated three times for the single occurrence after ""wif"".

- In the fourth example, ""dax bluf wif zup wif,"" ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" to ""green"" as well, while ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Here, ""wif"" appears twice, and each time it is followed by a word (""zup""), the associated color ""yellow"" is repeated once. 

- In the fifth example, ""dax wif bluf,"" the outputs are ""green red red."" ""Dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and since ""bluf"" appeared previously and was also followed by ""green,"" this supports the idea that ""wif"" indicates the repetition of the color that comes after it (in this case, ""red"").

Based on these observations, the rule for ""wif"" is as follows:

Rule: The word ""wif"" indicates that the color associated with the next word should be repeated in the output three times if it is a standalone, or the number of times ""wif"" precedes a word indicates the number of times the associated color for that word is repeated.

"Rule: zup -> yellow

Each occurrence of the word ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow"" in the output. It is consistent in every example provided. Additional words after ""zup"" may correspond with other colors (e.g., ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and ""bluf"" also correlates with ""red""), but ""zup"" consistently results in ""yellow"".",1.0,128,zup
"zup -> yellow.

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" is present as an input, the output always begins with ""yellow."" The other words (e.g., ""dax"", ""wif"", ""bluf"") in the input correspond to other colors which follow ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,128,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output always begins with the word ""yellow."" The presence of ""zup"" by itself equates to just ""yellow,"" and any additional words after ""zup"" produce additional color words in the output.",1.0,128,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

- When ""zup"" is used alone, the output is just ""yellow.""
- With additional words after ""zup,"" each word seems to correspond to a color.

From this pattern, it can be inferred that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" When presented with additional words, ""zup"" maintains its meaning, and each additional word is associated with another color.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow

When ""zup"" is followed by other nonce words, each of those nonce words corresponds to an additional color output. The sequence of colors starts with yellow, given by ""zup,"" and is followed by colors represented by each subsequent nonce word in the order they appear.",1.0,128,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs, looking for patterns.

1. When ""bluf"" is at the end of the input string, the corresponding output ends with one more red than there are instances of the word right before ""bluf."" In the first example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red,"" so ""bluf"" here seems to cause the replication of the color that ""wif"" stands for, plus an extra red.

2. In the second example, ""wif"" occurs twice before ""bluf,"" and the output is ""yellow red red red,"" which follows the same pattern - two repetitions of the color that ""wif"" stands for (red) plus an extra red.

3. In the third example, ""dax"" is immediately before ""bluf,"" and the output is ""green green red."" The pattern holds as ""dax"" stands for green, and we see it repeated once plus an extra red.

4. However, when ""bluf"" isn't at the end (it's followed by another word), the output is two instances of the color corresponding to the word right after ""bluf.""

5. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" and the output has ""green"" twice, which corresponds to ""dax,"" the word before ""bluf.""

6. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" and we see ""yellow"" twice in the output, which corresponds to ""zup,"" the word before ""bluf.""

Given these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be as follows:

- When ""bluf"" is followed by a word, the output is two instances of the color that corresponds to the following word.
- When ""bluf"" is at the end of the input, the output is one duplication of the color associated with the preceding word, followed by an additional red.

Therefore, the rule is: 

Rule: If ""bluf"" is followed by another word, output two instances of the color corresponding to the word after ""bluf."" If ""bluf"" is the last word, output the color corresponding to the word before ""bluf"" repeated once, followed by an extra ""red.""",0.9,128,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule behind the word ""bluf,"" it is necessary to look for patterns in the given examples. Here’s what we can observe:

1. In the first example, the word ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output shows a break in the pattern (blue blue blue) with the introduction of a new color, ""red."" 
2. The second example has ""bluf"" surrounded by ""wif"" and ""walm"" which leads to a repetition of ""yellow,"" but the repetition starts before ""bluf,"" so the rule may not be linked to ""bluf"" alone.
3. In the third example, the output is ""green green red"" where ""bluf"" follows ""dax."" Here ""bluf"" coincides with a repetition of ""green"" and ends the sequence with a ""red.""
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is at the end and followed by ""green green,"" which indicates that ""bluf"" might be causing the word before it (""dax"") to repeat.
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and leads to a repetition of ""yellow,"" once again suggesting that ""bluf"" might cause the previous word to repeat.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" indicates the word before it should be repeated in the output sequence. The color associated with the word right before ""bluf"" is repeated, and after ""bluf"" executes its rule, the sequence continues regularly. Note that the presence of ""bluf"" does not affect the color that corresponds to it specifically, but affects the repetition of the prior word's associated color.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word in the output sequence.",0.8,128,bluf
"To deduce what ""bluf"" means, we need to seek patterns that relate the input to the output. Let's examine each example one by one to find the rule:

Example 1:
Input: lug walm wif bluf
Output: blue blue blue red red
- Here, ""bluf"" appears at the end of a series of words which are translated into colors, ending with a sequence of two reds. 

Example 2:
Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
- In this example, ""bluf"" is followed by a word that has already appeared before (""wif""), and we see an additional ""red"" at the end of the output compared to the output of that same word (""wif"") before ""bluf"".

Example 3:
Input: dax bluf wif
Output: green green red
- Here, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""wif"". The first appearance of ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and after ""bluf"" we see another ""green"" before the ""red"" associated with ""wif"".

Example 4:
Input: wif zup dax bluf
Output: red yellow green green
- ""Bluf"" is at the last position following a new word order, and the color ""green"" is doubled after it when ""dax"" is mentioned next.

Example 5:
Input: zup bluf dax lug
Output: yellow yellow green blue
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which translates to ""yellow"", we see that ""yellow"" is repeated once before moving on to the next colors.

Looking at these patterns, it seems that ""bluf"" causes the next word's color to be repeated. Another pattern is that there are always two colors after the word ""bluf"" when there is a word following ""bluf"" in the input sequence.

Rule:
bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the following word (if there is one) and then add ""red"". If ""bluf"" is the last word in the sequence, just add ""red"" twice.",0.8,128,bluf
"Rule: ""bluf"" -> the color that precedes it; if no color precedes it, the color green.",0.2,128,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that comes immediately after it. If there is no word after it, the color is green.",0.0,128,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", let's look for patterns in each instance it's used and the corresponding output.

1. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which corresponds to a repetition of ""blue"", suggesting ""walm"" might mean ""repeat the last color"".

2. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   In this sequence, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" again and results in an additional ""blue"".

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   ""Walm"" occurs after ""dax"", which is green, and the color green is repeated twice after.

4. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   In this sequence, ""walm"" occurs after ""wif"" and the color red is repeated, it also occurs after ""zup"" and the color yellow is repeated. This supports the idea that ""walm"" may mean ""repeat.""

5. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
   Again after ""dax"", which corresponds to green, the word ""walm"" results in repeating the color green before ""lug"" changes it to blue.

Given the above examples, the rule can be determined as:

Rule: ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the color associated with the previous word.

So,

walm -> meaning. Meaning: repeat the last color.",1.0,128,walm
"To determine the rule for ""walm"", we need to look at the patterns in the outputs based on the presence of ""walm"" in the inputs. Let's examine each example:

1. Input: ""lug walm dax""
   Output: ""blue blue blue green""
   
   We see that ""lug"" results in ""blue"", and since ""dax"" is followed by ""green"", it seems that ""dax"" results in ""green"". However, since there are three instances of ""blue"" before the ""green"", the first ""blue"" can be attributed to ""lug"", suggesting ""walm"" also results in ""blue"".
   
2. Input: ""wif dax lug walm""
   Output: ""red green blue blue blue""
   
   ""wif"" is followed by ""red"", and we have previously seen ""lug"" linked with ""blue"" and ""dax"" linked with ""green"". After ""lug"", we see ""blue"" again but followed by two more ""blue"" outputs, which could be due to ""walm"".
   
3. Input: ""dax walm""
   Output: ""green green green""
   
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and with no ""lug"" present, the additional ""green"" outputs might be because of ""walm"".
   
4. Input: ""wif walm zup lug zup walm""
   Output: ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
   
   ""wif"" resulting in ""red"" seems consistent, while ""lug"" has been consistently associated with ""blue"". ""zup"" appears to correspond to ""yellow"". With ""walm"" present twice, we see a set of ""red"" followed by a set of ""yellow"".
   
5. Input: ""dax walm lug""
   Output: ""green green green blue""
   
   ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green"", and ""lug"" is associated with the final ""blue"". The ""green"" outputs before ""blue"" include ""walm"" and can be attributed to it.

Examining all examples, we consistently see that the presence of ""walm"" is followed by repetitions of the color linked to the preceding word as a pattern. Specifically, the color corresponding to the word just before ""walm"" is repeated before the pattern changes due to another word. Therefore, ""walm"" seems to be a duplicator, causing the repetition of the color corresponding to the word before it.

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output color of the preceding word to be repeated for the number of times ""walm"" occurs plus one, until another non-""walm"" word is encountered.

walm -> causes repetition of the preceding output color.",0.9,128,walm
"To deduce what ""walm"" means, let's examine the relationship between the inputs and the corresponding output colors.

From the first example:
Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

Here, ""lug"" yields blue, ""walm"" yields blue, and ""dax"" yields green, but given the other outputs, we know that ""dax"" typically yields green. Thus, it's unclear whether ""walm"" affects the output or not.

From the second example:
Input: wif dax lug walm
Output: red green blue blue blue

Now, ""wif"" yields red and ""dax"" yields green. Given that ""lug"" yields blue only once, but there are three occurrences of blue after ""lug"" and ""walm"", it could imply that ""walm"" reinforces the color blue and repeats it.

From the third example:
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

We see that ""dax"" yields green, followed by two more greens, suggesting that perhaps ""walm"" repeats the color that preceded it.

From the fourth example:
Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""wif"" initially yields red, and then we see it repeated. After ""zup,"" we see yellow, and ""lug"" changes it to blue. Notice again after ""zup"" and ""walm"" we see repetitions of yellow.

From the fifth example:
Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue

""Dax"" yields green, ""walm"" seems to repeat the green, and ""lug"" finally turns the sequence to blue.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Thus:

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeats the color of the previous word in the sequence.",0.9,128,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns and the number of outputs in relation to the inputs:

1. ""lug walm dax"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue green""
2. ""wif dax lug walm"" -> Output: ""red green blue blue blue""
3. ""dax walm"" -> Output: ""green green green""
4. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" -> Output: ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""dax walm lug"" -> Output: ""green green green blue""

In each instance, ""walm"" is followed by one or more occurrences of the color ""blue"" in the output, suggesting that ""walm"" may directly translate to the color ""blue"" or to a rule that outputs multiple ""blue"" entries. Now let's analyze the consistency of this across the examples:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is directly followed by two ""blue"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""walm"" appears as the last term, and it is followed by three ""blue"" in the output.
- In the third example, ""walm"" is the second word and is followed by three ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" appears twice and each time it is followed by a series of ""yellow"" and then ""blue,"" but the number is not consistent with the previous examples.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by a single ""blue"" in the output.

It's clear that ""walm"" is associated with the color ""blue"" as it appears after its occurrence but there is no consistent pattern in terms of the number of ""blue"" color repetitions. The fourth input and output introduce some complexity that differs from the pattern observed in the other examples.

However, each time ""walm"" appears, the immediately following output color is always ""blue"". There is a discrepancy with the number of ""blue"" following ""walm"" which seems linked to other patterns affecting the output sequence, but the occurrence of at least one ""blue"" is consistent.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the rule for ""walm"" is most likely that it corresponds to the color ""blue"" being part of its output, but we do not have enough information to determine the exact rule for the number of times ""blue"" will appear following ""walm."" As such, the rule that can be extracted so far is:

Rule: walm -> meaning: The presence of the color ""blue"" in the output directly following the word ""walm"".",0.8,128,walm
"Based on the input and output sequences provided, we can attempt to deduce the rule that the word ""walm"" represents. We notice that the appearance of ""walm"" in the sequence always results in consecutive ""blue"" outputs before the next color is produced by the next word. The repetition of ""blue"" appears to be determined by the position of ""walm"" relative to the other words. Let's analyze the examples given:

- In the first example, ""lug walm dax"" correlates with ""blue blue blue green."" ""Lug"" and ""dax"" on their own are ""blue"" and ""green,"" respectively. The presence of ""walm"" results in two additional ""blue"" before ""green.""

- In the second example, ""wif dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""red green blue blue blue."" We can assume ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" produce ""red,"" ""green,"" and ""blue"" respectively. After ""lug,"" ""walm"" adds two more ""blue.""

- In the third example, ""dax walm"" matches ""green green green."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is green, and adds two more ""green.""

- In the fourth example, ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" the sequence is ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" ""Wif"" produces ""red,"" and ""zup"" produces ""yellow."" After ""wif,"" ""walm"" adds two more ""red,"" and after ""zup,"" ""walm"" adds three more ""yellow.""

- In the fifth example, ""dax walm lug"" corresponds to ""green green green blue."" ""Dax"" normally corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""Walm"" inserted between them adds two extra ""green.""

These observations suggest that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color output of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence. The number of repetitions appears to be based on the position of ""walm"" in the sequence. Specifically, it seems to repeat the preceding color output an additional number of times equal to its position in the sequence. For instance:

- In the first position, it adds two of the same color (since one plus one is two for the first position).
- In the second position, it adds three of the same color (one for the position of the word whose color is being repeated and two additional for the position of ""walm"").
- In the third position, as in the third example, it would add four, and so on.

The rule can be summarized as:
Rule: ""walm"" -> This nonce word causes the subsequent repetition of the color of the preceding word's output based on the position of ""walm"" in the sequence: one repeat for the position of the preceding word plus one additional repeat for each position ""walm"" is away from the start of the sequence.",0.8,128,walm

Rule: In each given example, dax consistently corresponds to the color green.",1.0,129,dax
"To determine the rule for ""wif"", we need to look at each example and identify patterns tied to its occurrences:

1. zup wif -> yellow red
   wif dax -> red green
   When ""wif"" stands alone (followed by a distinct word), we see it translates directly to ""red.""

2. lug wif lug dax bluf -> blue red blue green green
   The second ""lug"" is followed by ""dax,"" which we know from previous examples, translates to ""green."" Here, ""wif"" sits between two identical words ""lug,"" and it translates to ""red."" This is consistent with our initial observation from the first pattern.

3. wif lug -> red blue
   ""wif"" comes before ""lug,"" which we've seen translates to ""blue."" Again, ""wif"" itself translates to ""red.""

4. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   We see that ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" then ""wif"" to ""red."" The word ""walm"" after ""wif"" has a repeated color ""red,"" and when it follows ""zup,"" it changes to ""yellow."" In this example, ""wif"" is not delimited by the same word on both sides nor stands alone; it precedes a word that then replicates its color, although this behavior changes when we see ""walm"" elsewhere in the sequence.

From the given examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" directly translates to ""red,"" potentially with the added rule that the word following ""wif"" may replicate the color ""red"" if immediately followed by ""wif,"" although further examples might be needed to confirm that last part of the rule outside of the ""wif walm"" pattern.

Rule: wif -> ""red""

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" translates to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,129,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" 

Here's a breakdown of each example which guides the conclusion:

Input: zup wif | Output: yellow red -> ""wif"" follows ""zup"" and corresponds to ""red.""
Input: wif dax | Output: red green -> ""wif"" precedes ""dax"" and corresponds to ""red.""
Input: lug wif lug dax bluf | Output: blue red blue green green -> ""wif"" is between two ""lug"" and corresponds to ""red.""

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm | Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow -> ""wif"" follows ""dax"" corresponding to ""red,"" and when ""walm"" is mentioned after ""wif,"" it is also ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,129,wif
"From the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Therefore, we can deduce the meaning of ""wif"" as follows:

wif -> red

Rule:
When the input contains ""wif,"" the output will include the color ""red"" in the place where ""wif"" appears in the input sequence.",1.0,129,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we must look at the patterns in the given examples and the corresponding outputs. Here's the breakdown of the examples provided:

- Input: zup wif | Output: yellow red
- Input: wif dax | Output: red green
- Input: lug wif lug dax bluf | Output: blue red blue green green
- Input: wif lug | Output: red blue
- Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm | Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

Firstly, we notice that ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

Secondly, let's note that each word in the input correlates with a color in the output:

- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" is associated with ""green.""
- ""walm"" is associated with ""yellow.""

Using these associations, we find that ""wif,"" consistently translates to ""red"" in every example where it appears. Therefore, we can deduce:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,129,wif

"Rule: Bluf corresponds to the color immediately preceding it in the sequence. If it is the first word, then it repeats the color it corresponds to.

Bluf -> The color corresponding to the word right before it, or if it's the first word, it repeats the color it stands for.",1.0,129,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" translates to the color that corresponds to the word directly preceding it. In all cases, ""bluf"" takes on the color meaning of the word before it.

Hence, we can write the rule as:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: If a word corresponds to a color and is followed by the word ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" takes the color value of the preceding word.",1.0,129,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color that is named just before it. Here's the pattern observed:

- In the first example, every time ""bluf"" appears after ""lug,"" the output is ""blue""
- In the second example, when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green""
- In the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" after ""wif"" results in ""red""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" after ""lug"" once again results in ""blue""

By following this pattern, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word.",1.0,129,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue."" To confirm this hypothesis, I will check for consistency across different examples:

- In the first example, every occurrence of ""lug"" is translated to ""blue,"" except when preceded by ""bluf,"" which is also translated to ""blue."" This suggests that ""bluf"" itself means ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is again translated to ""blue,"" consistent with the hypothesis.
- The third example translates ""bluf"" to ""red."" However, this is inconsistent with the previous examples unless we consider that ""wif"" might affect the output color. Not enough information is given for ""wif,"" but we can guess that it may cause a color change in the following word, ""bluf,"" which might explain why ""bluf"" turns to ""red"" in this example.
- The fourth example has ""bluf"" translating to ""blue"" again, which is consistent with our initial hypothesis, as there is no ""wif"" preceding it.
- Again, in the fifth example, ""bluf"" correlates with ""blue.""

Given the consistency across the majority of examples (with the exception of example three, where there might be another variable affecting the outcome), we can induce that:

Rule: bluf -> blue",0.8,129,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, there seems to be a pattern between the input word ""walm"" and the output colors. If we analyze each instance:

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""walm"" -> red red

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""walm"" -> green green
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""walm"" -> red red

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""walm"" -> green green
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""dax"" -> green

Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""walm"" -> green green

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""walm"" -> blue blue

The pattern indicates that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that comes directly before it twice. Therefore, we can deduce the meaning of ""walm"" in the context of these examples as:

walm -> meaning. The meaning is to repeat the color associated with the previous word two times.

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeat the color of the previous word two times.",1.0,129,walm
"walm -> meaning. Rule: ""walm"" causes the output to be three of the same color that corresponds to the color of the word that precedes ""walm."" For example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" and ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue.""",1.0,129,walm
"walm -> meaning. Rule: Based on the given examples, every time the word 'walm' appears, the output consists of three consecutive 'green'. Therefore, walm seems to mean 'green green green'.",1.0,129,walm
"Based on the given examples, each occurence of the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to three repetitions of the color that precedes it in the sequence. To illustrate:

- In the first example, ""wif"" means red, and after ""walm"" follows three reds.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" which means green, so after the first mention of ""walm"" are three greens followed by ""wif walm"" which results in three reds.
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" again resulting in three greens.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is also preceded by ""dax"" resulting in three greens.
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" means blue, and after ""walm"" follows three blues.

From these observations, the rule for the meaning of ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color mentioned immediately before ""walm"" three times.",1.0,129,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" as seen consistently in each example.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" when it follows ""dax,"" except when it is following ""walm"" (in the second example).
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" seen in the third and fourth examples.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" shown in the third and fifth examples.

The word ""walm"" appears to change the rule somehow, as seen in the first and second examples.

To further understand, let's examine the pattern while focusing on the position of ""walm"":

1. When immediately followed by ""wif,"" ""walm"" translates to two instances of ""red"" (Example 1: ""dax wif walm"" gives ""green red red red"").
2. When ""walm"" occurs twice with ""wif"" in between, both ""walm"" and ""wif"" turn into triple ""red"" (Example 2: ""dax walm wif walm"" gives ""green green green red red red"").
3. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup,"" ""walm"" becomes triple ""green,"" while ""zup"" stays ""yellow"" (Example 3).
4. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which in turn follows ""dax,"" ""walm"" remains triple ""green"" (Example 4).
5. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" both ""lug"" and ""walm"" translate to triple ""blue"" (Example 5).

Taking these observations into account, ""walm"" seems to replicate the color of the word right before it three times. The base color is determined by what the original word without ""walm"" would translate to. ""Walm"" does not affect the word following it, except when it is ""wif"" and immediately follows ""walm,"" in which case it also follows the same replication pattern (Example 2).

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: ""walm"" -> replicates the color of the previous word three times. If the previous word is ""wif"" immediately following ""walm,"" that ""wif"" will also replicate the same color three times.",0.9,129,walm
"From the given examples, one can induce that the nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" 

Here is the analysis step by step:

- In every example where ""lug"" is present, the word ""blue"" also appears in the output.
- The word ""lug"" does not seem to change its output meaning based on position, as it consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of where it is placed in the input.
- No other word in the input that corresponds to the color blue is repeated, therefore ""lug"" must be the word that is resulting in the color blue in the output.

Therefore, we can state the rule as: lug -> blue",1.0,130,lug
"Rule: lug -> blue

The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given examples. Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output, regardless of the position of ""lug"" within the sequence of other words.

Hence:
Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
Input: dax lug zup -> Output: green blue yellow
Input: zup wif lug zup walm -> Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
Input: lug wif lug dax bluf -> Output: blue red blue green green
Input: dax zup lug wif zup -> Output: green yellow blue red yellow",1.0,130,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's observe the patterns and relationships in the given input-output pairs.

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

Input: dax lug zup
Output: green blue yellow

Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
Output: blue red blue green green

Input: dax zup lug wif zup
Output: green yellow blue red yellow

Notice that whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output. For the first input, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and with the addition of ""lug,"" we get ""blue"" as the second color in the output. In the second input, the addition of ""lug"" again results in ""blue"" as the second color following ""green,"" which corresponds to ""dax."" This pattern continues across all examples, suggesting that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" However, in example four, ""lug"" appears first, followed by ""wif"" again and then ""dax,"" and the outputs are ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""green,"" respectively. This example further confirms that the word ""lug"" directly translates to the color ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule for ""lug"" is:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,130,lug
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue."" Here's how the rule is deduced:

- Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue (Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."")
- Input: dax lug zup -> Output: green blue yellow (Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."")
- Input: zup wif lug zup walm -> Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

- Input: lug wif lug dax bluf -> Output: blue red blue green green
(""lug"" is used twice and both instances correspond to ""blue."")
- Input: dax zup lug wif zup -> Output: green yellow blue red yellow
(Once more, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."")

Evidence:

1. In the first example, ""zup wif walm,"" 'zup' translates to 'yellow' and 'wif' to 'red.' 'Walm' following 'wif' leads to 'red' repeated three times, indicating walm means repeat the prior color three times.

2. In the second example, ""dax zup walm wif,"" we see 'dax' is 'green,' 'zup' is 'yellow,' and 'wif' is 'red.' After 'zup' and before 'wif,' 'walm' causes 'yellow' to be repeated three times, further supporting the rule.

3. The third example, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm,"" follows the pattern with 'dax' translating to 'green', 'wif' as 'red,' and 'lug' as 'blue.' Each instance of 'walm' causes the preceding color ('green' from 'dax' and 'green' again after the second 'dax') to be repeated three times.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax walm,"" 'dax' translates to 'green,' and 'walm' causes this color to be repeated, yielding 'green green green.'

5. The fifth example is identical to the first and serves as a reinforcement of the initially observed rule, with 'walm' causing 'red' to be repeated three times after 'wif.'

Rule: Walm means to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it three times.",1.0,130,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to induce the rule for the nonce word ""walm.""

From the first and fifth examples:
- Input: zup wif walm
- Output: yellow red red red

We can see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Since ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" and there are three ""red"" outputs, it seems that ""walm"" may cause repetition of the color associated with the previous word, in this case, ""red.""

From the second example:
- Input: dax zup walm wif
- Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

Here ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" After ""zup,"" we see repeating ""yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" again causes the repetition of the previous color.

From the third example:
- Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
- Output: green green green red blue green green green

Here ""dax"" repeats as ""green"" after ""walm,"" similar to our previous deduction, and again ""green"" is repeated after ""walm"" towards the end. ""wif"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""red"" and ""blue"" respectively, but no repetition is seen after them, which supports the idea that ""walm"" is specifically causing the repetition.

From the fourth example:
- Input: dax walm
- Output: green green green

We can confirm that ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""dax"" to repeat, as there is no other word between ""dax"" and ""walm"".

Based on these deductions, the rule seems to be:

Rule: Walm -> causes the color of the previous word to be repeated three times.",0.9,130,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's look at the correspondence between the inputs and outputs.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

We can see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and given that ""walm"" is the only other word in the input, it must correspond to the repeated ""red"" in the output.

Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""wif"" to ""red"" as established before. Here ""walm"" is followed by two ""yellow"", so it seems like ""walm"" might mean ""repeat the previous color"" or ""repeat the color of the word before it"".

Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output: green green green red blue green green green

Following the potential rule for ""walm"", green is repeated after ""dax"", then ""wif"" is ""red"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""dax"" is once more ""green"". Again, after ""dax walm"", ""green"" is repeated.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Without any other context, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and following ""walm"" we see ""green"" repeated.

Based on these examples, the results are consistent with the rule that ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the word before it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word before it.",0.8,130,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we will look at each input-output pair and identify the pattern.

1. **Input:** zup wif walm
   **Output:** yellow red red red

2. **Input:** dax zup walm wif
   **Output:** green yellow yellow yellow red

3. **Input:** dax walm wif lug dax walm
   **Output:** green green green red blue green green green

4. **Input:** dax walm
   **Output:** green green green

5. **Input:** zup wif walm
   **Output:** yellow red red red

Looking at the outputs, ""walm"" always produces three colors in succession, specifically the same color repeated three times. Let's match the words with the colors:

- In examples 1 and 5, ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red red.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and is followed by ""wif,"" and the output includes ""yellow yellow yellow red.""
- In example 3, ""walm"" is shown two times, both after ""dax."" Each time it produces ""green green green.""
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and again produces ""green green green.""

From these observations, we can conclude that ""walm"" produces a triplet of colors that are based on the preceding word. Specifically:

- ""dax"" before ""walm"" results in ""green green green.""
- ""zup"" before ""walm"" would theoretically result in ""yellow yellow yellow"" (deduced from example 2).
- ""wif"" before ""walm"" results in ""red red red.""

Since we only have examples with ""dax"" and ""zup"" before ""walm,"" we cannot be certain about the situation where ""walm"" is the first word or follows other words. However, based on provided examples, the behavior is consistent when following ""dax,"" ""zup,"" or ""wif.""

Rule: ""walm"" translates into three consecutive colors that depend on the word that precedes it: ""dax"" leads to ""green green green,"" ""zup"" would lead to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and ""wif"" leads to ""red red red.""

"From analyzing the examples provided, it is evident that the word ""walm"" results in the color ""green"" being outputted three times.

Rule: walm -> green green green",0.0,130,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" we should first look at the constant presence of ""lug"" in the input and its corresponding output to identify any patterns.

1. ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue""

3. ""wif zup bluf lug"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue""
4. ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
5. ""dax wif lug"" -> ""green red blue""

A closer examination reveals the following observations:

- Whenever ""lug"" is present in the input, ""blue"" is present in the output.
- The position of ""blue"" in the output corresponds directly to the position of ""lug"" in the input.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Examining the first input-output pair:

Input: wif zup bluf lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue
- ""wif"" still corresponds with ""red""
- ""zup"" still corresponds with ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" corresponds with ""yellow""
- ""lug"" still corresponds with ""blue""

Examining the fourth input-output pair:
Input: wif lug

Examining the fifth input-output pair:
Input: dax wif lug
Output: green red blue
- ""dax"" still corresponds with ""green""
- ""wif"" still corresponds with ""red""
- ""lug"" still corresponds with ""blue""

Analyzing all of the data, we can see a consistent pattern that, regardless of its position or the words around it, ""lug"" always corresponds with the color ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, we can induce that the meaning of ""lug"" does not depend on the context in this case and has a one-to-one correspondence with the color ""blue.""

From the outputs corresponding to each input, we see that 'zup' consistently translates to the color 'yellow', regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that surround it. There doesn't seem to be a dependency on context for the meaning of 'zup'. Each time 'zup' appears in the input, 'yellow' appears in the same position in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,131,zup
"Based on the examples given, where ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input or the surrounding words, we can infer a straightforward rule for this nonce word as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,131,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position or the context within the examples provided.",1.0,131,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following patterns:

1. When `zup` is preceded and followed by the same word (e.g., `lug`), it translates to `yellow`.
2. `zup` by itself also translates to `yellow`.
3. When `zup` is between two different words (e.g., `dax walm zup lug walm`), it translates to `yellow` followed by the color corresponding to the next word (`lug` -> `blue`).
4. When `zup` appears before one or more different words without repetition (e.g., `lug zup bluf dax` and `zup wif bluf zup lug`), it translates to `yellow` followed by the pattern of colors corresponding to each of the subsequent words.

Let's apply these findings to all the input examples:

- In `dax walm zup lug walm`, `zup` precedes a pair of `walm`, which doesn't repeat immediately but does after `lug`, so `zup` yields `green yellow blue`.
- In `lug zup bluf dax`, `zup` is followed by `bluf` (red) and `dax` (green), so the pattern is `blue yellow red green`.
- For the sole `zup`, there are no surrounding words, so it remains `yellow`.
- In `zup wif bluf zup lug`, `zup` is first, producing `yellow`, followed by `wif` and `bluf` before the next `zup`; hence it produces `yellow red red`, and since the next `zup` has a repeating `lug` after it, it yields `yellow blue`.
- For `lug zup lug`, `zup` is surrounded by `lug`, so it translates to `blue yellow blue`.

Thus, considering all the examples, `zup` seems to correspond to `yellow` consistently. However, when followed by a word that subsequently repeats, `zup` also seems to yield the color corresponding to the next repeated word.

"Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word that precedes it.

- ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red"", so ""bluf"" mirrors the color of ""wif"", which is red.
- ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" outputs ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue"", where both instances of ""bluf"" repeat the color of the preceding word (first ""dax"" which is green, and then ""zup"" which is yellow).
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" outputs ""red red green green green"", where ""bluf"" again mirrors the color of ""wif"" which is red.
- ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow"", with ""bluf"" mimicking ""zup"", which is yellow.

"walm -> meaning. Rule:

Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be associated with the color repetition of the preceding word. To be precise, we see that in examples where ""walm"" is present, the color associated with the word before ""walm"" is repeated multiple times, equal to the number of letters in the preceding word. Here's the analysis:

- In the first example, ""wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to the color red and then ""walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" which is three times red, corresponding to the three letters in ""wif.""
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" occurs again, resulting in ""red red red.""
- The third example shows ""zup walm"" leading to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""zup"" is associated with yellow and there are three letters in ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, the pattern holds with ""wif walm"" resulting in ""red red red.""
- Similarly, in the last example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" where ""dax"" relates to green and there are three letters in ""dax.""

Hence, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to repeat for as many times as there are letters in that word.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the output color is repeated a number of times equal to the number of letters in the preceding word.",1.0,131,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the output color ""red"". Moreover, it appears that the colors are not only determined by the presence of ""walm"" but also by the other words in the input. Each word seems to be associated with a specific color.

Here are the observed mappings from the word to the color:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
- lug -> blue

When ""walm"" is placed after any of these words, the output becomes a series of the color related to that word. It seems that ""walm"" when used after a word, causes repetition of the color associated with the preceding word for the number of characters in the word ""walm"".

For example:

- ""walm"" after ""wif"" (3 letters long) leads to three ""red"" in the output.
- ""walm"" after ""dax"" (3 letters long) leads to three ""green"".
- ""walm"" after ""zup"" (3 letters long) leads to three ""yellow"".

The rule thus seems to be:

walm -> The output color is repeated as many times as there are letters in the word immediately preceding ""walm"".

With this rule, ""walm"" on its own does not have an intrinsic meaning but affects the output based on the context of the preceding word.",1.0,131,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the common patterns where ""walm"" appears and what the corresponding outputs are.

- In the first example, the input ""wif walm dax zup"" has the output ""red red red green yellow."" The word ""walm"" corresponds to the second ""red"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red,"" with ""walm"" again corresponding to ""red.""
- The third example, ""zup walm,"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which indicates that ""walm"" is related to ""yellow"" in this case.
- The fourth example shows that ""walm"" is part of a sequence that results in ""red red red"" for the part of output with ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" and all the corresponding ""red"" segments.
- Lastly, in ""dax walm,"" both ""dax"" and ""walm"" are translated to ""green.""

Based on the evidence, ""walm"" seems to take on the color of the word that precedes it:

- When preceded by ""wif,"" ""walm"" outputs ""red.""
- When preceded by ""zup,"" ""walm"" outputs ""yellow.""
- When preceded by ""dax,"" ""walm"" outputs ""green.""
- There's no instance of ""walm"" after ""bluf"" or ""lug"" on its own, so we can't assert the color for these cases. However, we might infer that ""walm"" doesn't have a color meaning on its own since it seems to be a copycat word that takes the color of the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the preceding word (i.e., ""walm"" after ""wif"" is red, after ""zup"" is yellow, and after ""dax"" is green).",0.9,131,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at how it correlates with the output in the provided examples:

1. When ""walm"" is present, the word that immediately precedes it in the input corresponds to the color repeated in the output. For example:
   - In ""wif walm dax zup,"" ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""red red red green yellow,"" showing a repetition of ""red"" thrice.
   - In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow yellow red red red,"" again showing a repetition of ""red"" thrice.
   - In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" showing a repetition of ""yellow"" thrice.
   - In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""green green green,"" showing a repetition of ""green"" thrice.
   
2. The number of times the color repeats in the output corresponds to the number of times the preceding word appears in the input. For instance:
   - In ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and appears in the input twice, corresponding to the color ""red"" being repeated twice in the output.
   
Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to indicate that the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""walm"" should be repeated in the output as many times as the preceding word appears in the input before ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word that precedes ""walm"" in the output, the number of times that the preceding word appears in the input before ""walm.""",0.8,131,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the input and output pairs to look for a pattern.

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- Here, ""walm"" corresponds to the second ""red.""

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- Again, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to a ""red.""

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""Walm"" follows ""zup"" and, in this case, corresponds to the third ""yellow.""

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
- ""Walm"" follows a ""wif"" and corresponds to the third ""red"" again.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and corresponds to the second and third ""green.""

From these examples, we can extract a pattern:

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is yellow.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green.
- The color before ""walm"" is repeated for ""walm"" and continues for the number of times the color has appeared.

General Rule:
walm -> the same color as the word that precedes it, repeated for as many times the color has appeared up to that point in the sequence.

Let's apply this general rule to confirm with the given examples:

- In the first input, ""wif"" corresponded to ""red."" Thus ""walm"" also corresponds to ""red,"" and since it's the second ""red,"" the pattern continues once more, resulting in three ""red"" outputs in a row.
- In the second input, ""wif"" again corresponded to ""red,"" making ""walm"" ""red"" as well, and the action repeats once.
- In the third input, ""zup"" corresponded to ""yellow,"" and so ""walm"" continues this color once because it's the second ""yellow.""
- In the fifth input, ""dax"" corresponded to ""green,"" and hence ""walm"" repeats the ""green"" twice more after ""dax"" since it's the second ""green.""

However, there is not enough information to conclusively determine a pattern for the word ""wif."" It may be possible that the unspecified rule could involve the position or the sequence of the words that may result in the color ""green,"" or it may have a specific meaning not yet demonstrated by the examples.",0.9,132,dax
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Every instance of ""wif"" leads to ""red"" in the output.",1.0,132,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,132,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,132,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that each unique word translates to a unique color and that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" 

There are no contexts in which ""wif"" leads to a different output; regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that come before or after it, ""wif"" always results in ""red."" Other words in the examples have their own consistent translations, with ""dax"" translating to ""green"" and ""lug"" translating to ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as: 

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""",1.0,132,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word is being transformed into a color. Here are the transformations according to the given inputs and outputs:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- bluf -> green

Every instance where the word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"". There's no indication that the meaning of ""wif"" changes based on position or surrounding words. The rule, therefore, seems straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,132,wif
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""zup"" appears to correspond to the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" is in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the same position.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,132,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" appears to be associated with the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" is present at the corresponding position in the output. Thus, the rule seems straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow
",1.0,132,zup
"Based on the input-output pairs provided, the meaning of ""zup"" can be derived from closely examining the pattern of the correlated colors:

1. When ""zup"" precedes a word, the output color is ""yellow"".
2. When ""zup"" follows a word, the color assigned to ""zup"" is the same as the color following it, except when ""wif"" follows ""zup"". In that case, ""zup"" still translates to ""yellow"".

Thus, the rule for zup can be inferred as follows:

Rule: When ""zup"" is present, it translates to ""yellow"".

The exception to note is that the presence of ""zup"" does not seem to affect the color output for other words. The words ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif"" maintain their respective color outputs as ""green,"" ""blue,"" and ""red"" regardless of the position of ""zup"".

zup -> ""yellow""",0.9,132,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine the common factor in all examples where it appears:

- In all instances, ""zup"" precedes a color.
- The presence of ""zup"" before another word changes the usual color associated with that word.

Based on the outputs following the appearance of ""zup,"" it seems that ""zup"" does not correlate to a static color. Instead, ""zup"" seems to indicate that the next color in the sequence will repeat the color that immediately followed the last occurrence of ""zup.""

Let's apply this rule:

1. In the first example, ""zup"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the output is ""yellow red."" We can't establish a rule from this alone because there's no prior ""zup.""

2. In the second example, ""zup"" precedes ""dax,"" turning ""green"" to ""yellow,"" and the next ""zup"" has the same color ""yellow"" following it. That aligns with our hypothesis.

3. In the third example, every time ""zup"" appears, the color ""yellow"" repeats.

4. In the fourth example, ""wif"" normally outputs ""red,"" but after the first ""zup,"" it turns to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" which normally outputs ""blue"" follows suit.

5. The fifth example follows the same pattern where ""dax"" (normally ""green"") and ""lug"" (normally ""blue"") each output ""yellow"" preceded by ""zup.""

Rule: zup -> causes the next mentioned item to repeat the color that followed the last occurrence of zup. If there is no previous occurrence of ""zup,"" then ""zup"" defaults to yellow.",0.9,132,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""zup"" acts as a modifier for the color associated with the following word. To deduce the rule for ""zup,"" let's analyze each example:

1. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""wif"" to red. ""zup walm"" results in yellow, which differs from the output we would expect for ""walm"" alone based on other examples.

2. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   In this example, ""zup"" precedes ""dax,"" which yields yellow rather than its usual green. ""Zup wif"" results in yellow instead of the expected red for ""wif.""

3. Input: zup lug zup dax
   Output: yellow blue yellow green
   Again, ""zup"" is changing the output of the word that follows it. ""lug"" usually corresponds to blue, which remains unchanged here, but ""zup dax"" leads to yellow instead of green.

4. Input: wif zup lug zup lug
   Output: red yellow blue yellow blue
   ""Wif"" corresponds to red. ""Zup lug"" gives us yellow instead of the usual blue for ""lug,"" but the second ""lug"" without ""zup"" before it remains blue.

5. Input: zup dax zup lug
   Output: yellow green yellow blue
   In each case, ""zup"" before a word changes the color associated with that word to yellow, except when it precedes ""lug,"" where the usual color (blue) is retained.

The rule for ""zup"" seems to be that it changes the color associated with the word that follows it to yellow, except when it precedes the word ""lug,"" in which case the original color (blue) is retained.

Rule: zup -> turns the following word's associated color into yellow, except if the following word is ""lug,"" in which case the color remains blue.",0.8,132,zup
"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word. 

In the given examples, 'bluf' results in the repetition of the color mentioned before it. If 'zup' is yellow, 'zup bluf' is 'yellow yellow'. If 'dax' is green, 'dax bluf' is 'green green'. Therefore, 'bluf' means to duplicate the color word preceding it.",1.0,132,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word 'bluf' corresponds to the same color as the preceding word. Here's the breakdown of the pattern:

- In the first example, 'zup' corresponds to yellow, and when 'bluf' follows 'zup', the output is yellow as well.
- In the second example, 'dax' corresponds to green, and when 'bluf' follows 'dax', the output is green as well.
- The third and fourth examples further confirm this pattern since 'bluf' follows 'zup' (yielding yellow) and 'dax' (yielding green), respectively.
- In the fifth example, 'wif' corresponds to red and 'lug' to blue. When 'bluf' follows 'lug', the color is blue; when 'bluf' follows 'wif', the color is red.

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of 'bluf' is the same color as the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: If x is the color associated with the word preceding 'bluf', then 'bluf' means x.",1.0,132,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color mentioned just before it. Here's a breakdown:

1. In the first example, the word before ""bluf"" is ""lug"" and the output for ""lug"" is ""blue"" so the output for ""bluf"" is also ""blue"".
2. In the second example, the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif"" and the color for ""wif"" is ""red"", so the output for ""bluf"" again follows this pattern and is ""red"".
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, so ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"".
4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" and again precedes ""bluf"", which also becomes ""green"".
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows the pattern of repeating the output color of the word right before it, which is ""lug"" translated to ""blue"", so ""bluf"" is output as ""blue"" twice.

Rule: bluf -> The color of the word immediately before ""bluf"" is repeated.",1.0,132,bluf
"Analyzing the provided examples:

1. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   
2. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue yellow red red green
   
3. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   
4. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   
5. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue

We can observe the following rules related to the input and output:

- The word ""lug"" maps to the color ""blue"".
- The word ""zup"" maps to the color ""yellow"".
- The word ""dax"" maps to the color ""green"".
- The word ""wif"" maps to the color ""red"".

The word ""bluf"" appears to have different outputs depending on the context:

- When following ""zup"", ""bluf"" also produces ""yellow"".
- When following ""dax"", ""bluf"" produces ""green"".
- When amidst ""wif walm lug"", ""bluf"" results in two ""blue"", which might be influenced by being near ""lug"", which means ""blue"".

However, there is a pattern where ""bluf"" replicates the color of the word it immediately follows. This can be seen in instances where ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and ""dax""; it duplicates the color ""yellow"" and ""green"" respectively.

The last example introduces confusion since it results in two ""blue"", which breaks the pattern. It might suggest that ""bluf"" can replicate the color of the preceding word, and when placed at the end of a sequence or near ""lug"", it also doubles the last color. However, without further examples specifically illustrating the behavior of ""bluf"" when situated close to ""lug"", this assumption about doubling the blue color might be premature.

Given the current data, the safest rule for ""bluf"" is that it duplicates the color of the word immediately before it.

Rule:
bluf -> duplicates the color of the preceding word.",0.8,132,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can induce a rule about the meaning of the word ""bluf"" in this context. Let's examine how ""bluf"" relates to the surrounding words and their corresponding outputs:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the corresponding output is ""yellow blue."" Since the word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue,"" we can tell that ""bluf"" must translate to ""yellow"" in this instance because ""lug"" does not change its output, and ""zup"" is also translated as ""yellow.""

2. In the second example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""dax,"" with the outputs being ""red red green."" Here, since ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""bluf"" in this context results in ""red"" corresponding to ""wif.""

3. The third example, which is just ""zup bluf,"" translates directly to ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""bluf"" on its own (or following ""zup"") results in ""yellow.""

4. Similarly, the fourth example has ""dax bluf,"" which translates to ""green green,"" so ""bluf"" following ""dax"" gives us ""green.""

5. The fifth example shows ""bluf"" following a repetition of ""lug"" and ""wif,"" with the output being ""red red blue blue."" The repeated words yield duplicate colors, so ""lug"" gives us ""red"" (as opposed to blue in other examples) and ""bluf"" also results in a repeated color, ""blue.""

From these observations, we can derive a rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the same color as the preceding word if the preceding word has a defined color output. If ""bluf"" is the first word or follows ""zup,"" it translates to ""yellow.""

In simpler terms, ""bluf"" seems to take on the color of the word before it, except when following ""zup"" or when it stands alone, in which case ""bluf"" means ""yellow.""

Thus, bluf -> the same color as the preceding word; default to yellow if preceded by ""zup"" or if there's no preceding word.",0.8,132,bluf
"walm -> meaning. Based on the given examples, ""walm"" appears to mean ""repeat the previous color.""

Rule:
Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, it takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,132,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce a rule that corresponds to the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Let's analyze the examples to deduce the pattern:

1. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" at both ends, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" seems to correspond with yet another ""yellow.""

2. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
Here, ""lug"" turns into ""blue,"" ""dax"" into ""green,"" and ""walm"" is associated with ""blue.""

3. dax zup walm wif -> green yellow yellow yellow red
""dax"" becomes ""green,"" ""zup"" becomes ""yellow,"" ""wif"" becomes ""red,"" and ""walm"" translates to another instance of ""yellow.""

4. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue
""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" results in additional ""blue.""

5. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue
""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" corresponds with more ""green.""

From these observations, we can infer a rule:
""walm"" corresponds to the color of the word that precedes it.

Therefore, the rule is: 
Rule: walm -> the color of the preceding word",1.0,132,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the patterns of the colors in the output corresponding to each input where ""walm"" appears.

- In the first input, the sequence ""lug zup walm lug"" corresponds to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" Here, ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of ""yellow,"" which is the color mapped to ""zup.""
  
- In the second input, ""lug walm dax"" results in ""blue blue blue green."" Here, ""walm"" causes a repetition of ""blue,"" which is the color initially mapped to ""lug.""

- In the third input, ""dax zup walm wif"" leads to ""green yellow yellow yellow red."" In this instance, ""walm"" again causes a repetition of ""yellow,"" following the color assigned to ""zup.""

- In the fourth input, ""zup lug walm"" generates ""yellow blue blue blue."" ""Walm"" repeats the color ""blue"" matched with ""lug.""
  
- Lastly, in the fifth input, ""dax walm zup lug"" results in ""green green green yellow blue."" The presence of ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""green,"" the color that corresponds to ""dax.""

From these patterns, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated until a new color is introduced. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be the repetition of the preceding color in the output sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word in the sequence until a new word with an associated color appears.",1.0,132,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided. Let's look at each input and its corresponding output in order to identify any consistencies.

We examine each instance where ""walm"" appears and see how it affects the output:

1. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
2. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
3. dax zup walm wif -> green yellow yellow yellow red
4. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue
5. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue

Looking at these examples, we can try to determine a pattern that ""walm"" is creating. We see that the color before ""walm"" is repeated, except before the last word when ""walm"" is not the final word in the input list.

So let's apply this potential rule:

1. ""lug zup walm lug"" has ""lug"" (blue) and ""zup"" (yellow) before ""walm,"" and indeed the colors after ""walm"" are yellow repeated once followed by blue.
2. ""lug walm dax"" has ""lug"" (blue) before ""walm,"" and following ""walm"" is the color blue repeated twice before changing to green with the appearance of ""dax.""
3. ""dax zup walm wif"" has ""dax"" (green) and ""zup"" (yellow) before ""walm,"" and the pattern after ""walm"" follows with yellow repeated once and ending with red after ""wif.""
4. ""zup lug walm"" follows this pattern as well with ""zup"" (yellow) and ""lug"" (blue) before ""walm,"" with blue repeated after ""walm.""
5. ""dax walm zup lug"" shows that ""dax"" (green) precedes ""walm,"" and there are two green outputs before the sequence changes, following the colors of ""zup"" and ""lug.""

Based on this, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color from the word immediately preceding it. If there is a succession of words before ""walm"" without any ""walm"" in between, all of their colors are repeated until a new non-""walm"" word is encountered, which changes the pattern.

Thus, using this rule for ""walm"":

walm -> Repeat the previous word's corresponding color in the output until a new word appears.",0.8,132,walm
"walm -> yellow. 

Rule: Based on the given examples, every time the word ""walm"" appears in the input, the corresponding color in the output is ""yellow.""",0.0,132,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output. The context of the sentence does not seem to affect its meaning. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,133,lug
"lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.",1.0,133,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of the context in which it is used within the given examples.",1.0,133,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the input contains the word 'lug', the output is 'blue'.",1.0,133,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,133,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the provided examples and outputs to find patterns:

1. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   In this sequence, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   ""Dax"" appears at the beginning here, and the entire output is ""green.""

3. Input: dax zup dax
   Output: green yellow green
   Both instances of ""dax"" correspond to ""green,"" and there is a ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

4. Input: lug dax bluf
   Output: blue green green
   Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and it appears after ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue.""

5. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue red green green red
   ""Dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and the other words correspond to colors in sequence as they appear in previous outputs (e.g., ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red"").

From these examples, we can formulate the rule:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

dax -> green",1.0,133,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's focus on contexts where it changes:

1. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"": Here ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and both translate to ""green.""
2. ""dax zup dax"" -> ""green yellow green"": Here ""dax"" appears at both the beginning and end, and both instances correspond to ""green.""
3. ""lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue green green"": ""dax"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and precedes ""bluf"" and translates to ""green.""
4. ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" -> ""yellow blue red green green red"": ""dax"" follows ""wif"" (red) and precedes ""bluf"" letting us guess that ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green.""

Based on the examples, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" regardless of its position or the words that precede or follow it. So, the meaning of ""dax"" seems to be the color green.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,133,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the patterns:

- In the first example, the word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" is still ""green,"" and it appears that the repetition of the word implies the color doesn't change.
- The third example further supports this; ""dax"" is consistently ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
- The fourth example again shows ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" is ""green.""
- Finally, the fifth example reaffirms the consistent color pattern where ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" regardless of the other words.

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" consistently, regardless of its position or the presence of other words in the sequence. 

dax -> green",1.0,133,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" The rule seems to be that whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the same position in the output.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,133,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's break down the inputs and corresponding outputs one by one, searching for patterns. We need to map the presence of the word ""dax"" and other words to their associated colors in the output:

1. Input: ""zup walm dax lug"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow green blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to the first ""yellow"" in the output.
   - ""walm"" corresponds to the second ""yellow"" in the output.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
   - ""dax"" precedes ""green.""

2. Input: ""dax walm"" -> Output: ""green green green""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output, which differs from example 1.

3. Input: ""dax zup dax"" -> Output: ""green yellow green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
   - Both occurrences of ""dax"" lead to ""green.""

4. Input: ""lug dax bluf"" -> Output: ""blue green green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, like in example 1.
   - ""dax"" precedes ""green,"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to the second ""green.""

5. Input: ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" -> Output: ""yellow blue red green green red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" like in previous examples.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""dax"" precedes ""green.""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" but ""wif"" also corresponds to ""red"" in a pattern.

The occurrences of ""dax"" consistently map to the color ""green"" in the output. However, there are some inconsistencies—for instance, ""walm"" mapping to both ""yellow"" and ""green."" This could indicate that ""dax"" changes the color output of the word following it to ""green.""

To reconcile this, let's apply the rule that ""dax"" changes the next word's associated color output to ""green"":

- In the first pattern, ""lug"" normally produces ""blue,"" but with ""dax"" preceding it, the output is ""green.""
- In the second pattern, without seeing ""walm"" alone, we can't derive its inherence color, but using ""dax"" always results in ""green.""
- In the third, ""zup"" keeps its color ""yellow"" because it does not follow ""dax.""
- In the fourth and fifth examples, the pattern follows—with ""lug"" and ""bluf"" normally producing ""blue"" and ""green"" respectively, but with ""dax"" preceding them, we notice ""green"" in the output instead.

Given this analysis, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""dax"" changes the color associated with the following word to ""green.""

Thus:

dax -> Changes the color of the next word to green.",0.9,133,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in an input, the color ""red"" appears in the corresponding output. There is no variation in this relationship across all given examples.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Thus, under the constraints of the given examples, the rule appears to be straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red

This means ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""

However, it is worth noting that without additional context or examples, this rule is formed solely on the observable pattern and may not account for any other rules that are not evident due to the limited data set. If ""wif"" were to appear in other contexts with different outputs, the rule might need to be adjusted to accommodate the new information.",1.0,133,wif

"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to repeat the color indicated by the word that directly precedes it, for a count of three. For example:

- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and following ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""wif walm dax,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so after ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red,"" and then ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

To use this rule in the context of all given examples:

- ""lug walm"" is followed by ""blue blue blue"" (as ""lug"" indicates ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats the previous color three times).
- ""wif walm dax"" includes ""red red red green"" (with ""wif"" indicating ""red,"" followed by ""walm"" repeating ""red"" three times, and ""dax"" adding a ""green"").
- ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue"" (with ""dax"" indicating a ""green,"" followed by ""lug"" indicating a ""blue,"" and ""walm"" again repeating the blue three times).
- ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" becomes ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue"" (indicating the three-fold repetition effect of ""walm"" after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow"").
- ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red"" (displaying once more that ""walm"" repeats the color before it three times, here after ""zup"" indicating ""yellow"").

Rule: walm -> repeating the preceding color three times.",1.0,133,walm
"Looking at the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Here is a breakdown based on the inputs and outputs provided:

1. ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" meaning ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" and since ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated three times as the output.

2. ""wif walm dax"" leads to ""red red red green,"" meaning ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" and since ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the color ""red"" is repeated three times, followed by ""green,"" which corresponds to ""dax.""

3. ""dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue blue blue,"" meaning ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" and since ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated three times after the initial ""green,"" which corresponds to ""dax.""

4. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" leads to ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue,"" which follows the same principle as the previous examples. The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" and since ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

5. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red,"" which again follows the same principle where ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times.

Based on these observations, the rule for the meaning of ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" appears after a color word, it causes the corresponding color to be repeated three times as output.

Hence, walm -> causes the preceeding color word to be repeated three times.",1.0,133,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" indicates that the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" should be repeated three times in sequence. Let's break down each input and output to determine the rule for ""walm"":

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
Rule Observation: ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""walm"" repeats blue three times.

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
Rule Observation: ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""walm"" repeats red three times, followed by the color for ""dax"" which is green.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
Rule Observation: ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""walm"" repeats blue three times, after the color for ""dax,"" which is green.

Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
Rule Observation: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""walm"" repeats yellow three times, with other color mappings surrounding it.

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
Rule Observation: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""walm"" repeats yellow three times, with other color mappings following it.

Rule:
walm -> When ""walm"" follows another word, it indicates that the output should contain three consecutive repetitions of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"".",1.0,133,walm
"walm -> repeat the color of the previous word. Rule: The word ""walm"" results in the output repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,133,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, focusing on the instances where ""lug"" appears.

From the examples:

1. When ""lug"" appears in an input sequence, ""blue"" appears in the output sequence.
2. The position of ""lug"" in the input sequence corresponds to the position of ""blue"" in the output sequence.

Given every example input that includes ""lug"" results in an output with ""blue"" in the corresponding position, we can conclude that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in the output.

"Analyzing the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

Input: lug walm zup

Output: green yellow red red blue

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red

Input: lug zup dax zup
Output: blue yellow green yellow

Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

The word ""lug"" in every input corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. Regardless of position in the sequence, ""lug"" always translates to ""blue"". This consistency across the different examples suggests a direct mapping of the word ""lug"" to the color ""blue"".

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,134,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"", regardless of its position in the input sequence. No other color is consistently associated with the word ""lug"" in different contexts, which suggests that ""lug"" specifically corresponds to ""blue"" and is not dependent on any other factors in the sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,134,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's analyze the input and corresponding output patterns:

- Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.
- The position of ""lug"" in the input does not affect the color it is associated with in the output; it is always ""blue.""

Given the consistent one-to-one relationship between ""lug"" and the output ""blue,"" regardless of the position or surrounding words, we can deduce the following meaning:

"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,134,dax

No other context or modifiers change the output when ""dax"" is present; it consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sentence or the presence of other nonce words. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: ""dax"" -> ""green""",1.0,134,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" is used in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output.

Examples to support this rule:
- Input: ""dax"" -> Output: ""green""
- Input: ""lug zup dax walm"" -> Output: ""blue yellow green green green"" (Notice: ""dax"" corresponds to one ""green"" and ""walm,"" which is new, also corresponds to a sequence of ""green""s, possibly due to repeating the previous color)
- Input: ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" -> Output: ""blue red blue green green"" (Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""bluf"" might follow the rule of repeating the previous color if it follows ""dax"")
- Input: ""zup wif dax"" -> Output: ""yellow red green""
- Input: ""wif dax wif"" -> Output: ""red green red""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,134,dax

"From the examples provided, we can observe that every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green."" There are no instances where ""dax"" leads to a different output. Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds directly to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,134,dax
"Given the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" However, the number of times ""red"" is repeated in the output appears to be dependent on the presence and quantity of other words in the input. Notably, when ""walm"" is present alongside ""wif,"" the word ""red"" is repeated three times in the output.

It appears that the repetition of ""red"" in the output corresponds to this pattern:
- When ""wif"" is by itself, the output is ""red"" once.
- When ""wif"" is accompanied by ""walm,"" ""red"" is output three times.
- When ""wif"" is accompanied by an additional word (""bluf,"" ""zup,"" ""dax""), ""red"" is output once, and those additional words have their corresponding color outputs (""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"").

Given these observations, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output. The repetition or presence of additional colors is influenced by the other words in the input sequence.

2. When ""wif"" is preceded by another word, it outputs ""red"" twice.
3. Different words before ""wif"" don't seem to affect the fact that ""wif"" translates to ""red"". For example, ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green red red"", where the ""wif"" specifically corresponds to ""red red"".
4. When ""wif"" follows a sequence of words or is embedded in a sequence, it still translates to ""red red"" (as seen in ""zup wif bluf zup"" and ""dax walm wif bluf""). The duplication of ""red"" does not appear to depend on the word that follows ""wif"".

Rule: wif -> red when it is at the beginning or on its own, and wif -> red red when it is preceded by other words.",0.8,134,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",0.8,134,wif

"Based on the examples given, every instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""blue"". 

Rule: bluf -> blue",1.0,134,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that ""walm"" corresponds with repeating the color associated with the word that precedes it three times. Here are the breakdowns according to each example:

1. In the phrase ""dax walm zup walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds with ""green"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" After ""walm"" we see that the color of the word before ""walm"" is repeated three times.

2. In the phrase ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Each time ""walm"" appears, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated three times.

3. In the phrase ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" has no direct output but precedes ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" and after ""walm"" we see ""blue"" repeated three times, which corresponds to ""lug.""

4. In the phrase ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and after ""walm"" we see ""green"" repeated three times.

5. In the phrase ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and after ""walm"" we see ""yellow"" repeated three times, which corresponds to ""zup.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,134,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word 'walm' causes the output to include a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding 'walm'. The number of repetitions is three if 'walm' follows 'dax' (green), and it is two if 'walm' follows any other word.

Here are the associations we can see:

- 'dax' by itself results in a single 'green'.
- 'walm' following 'dax' results in 'green' being repeated three times.
- 'walm' following any other word results in the color associated with that word being repeated twice.
  
It seems that 'dax' is a special case, as it magnifies the effect of 'walm' by causing three repetitions instead of two.

If we summarize these observations, we can write the rule as follows:

Rule: walm -> When following 'dax', repeat 'green' three times. When following any other word, repeat the associated color of that word twice.",0.9,134,walm
"Based on the given examples, we notice a pattern related to the word ""walm"" and how it translates to repetitions of color outputs. Here's what the pattern reveals:

1. In the context where ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""

2. In the context where ""walm"" is preceded by any word other than ""dax"" or ""lug,"" it results in the color associated with the preceding word repeated with an additional occurrence of ""yellow.""

3. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" there is no repetition or yellow; the preceding color ""blue"" is maintained.

So, the rule seems to be:
- If ""walm"" directly follows ""dax,"" the output is three repetitions of ""green.""
- If ""walm"" follows any word other than ""dax"" or ""lug,"" it outputs the preceding color three times, followed by ""yellow"" repeated twice.
- If ""walm"" directly follows ""lug,"" it appears to maintain the output color ""blue"" without any further effect such as repetition or adding yellow.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color if it is ""green"" or ""blue,"" with no additional effect following ""green"" and without alteration following ""blue."" If the preceding color is anything but green or blue, repeat it three times followed by ""yellow"" twice.",0.9,134,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can analyze the pattern in the given examples.

In every example, ""walm"" is followed by a series of colors in the Output. By comparing the words used in the Input with their corresponding color in the Output, we can notice that each word seems to have an associated color:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> blue

Now, observing the number of color repetitions after ""walm"":

1. In the first example, after ""walm,"" the color sequence is ""green yellow,"" with ""green"" appearing three times and ""yellow"" appearing three times.
2. In the second example, after the first ""walm,"" the sequence is ""green yellow,"" with ""green"" appearing once and ""yellow"" appearing twice. After the second ""walm,"" ""blue"" appears three times.
3. In the third example, after ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" appears three times.
4. In the fourth example, after ""walm,"" the color ""green"" appears three times.
5. In the fifth example, after ""walm,"" the colors ""yellow blue"" appear, with ""yellow"" twice and ""blue"" once. Then, following the final ""walm,"" ""blue"" appears once.

Here are the key observations:
- Whenever ""walm"" appears, it is followed by a threefold repetition of certain colors.
- The series of repeated colors after ""walm"" seem to correspond to the preceding non-""walm"" words. Each non-""walm"" word contributes its respective color to the series, creating a rule about the ordering of colors after ""walm.""

Given these observations, ""walm"" might imply a rule related to repeating the associated color of the preceding word(s) three times. However, there is an inconsistency in the last example that needs to be resolved.

Adjusting for this inconsistency, we might deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color of the immediate preceding word three times unless interrupted by another ""walm"", where it will then start repeating the color of the new word following the second ""walm.""

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to function as an instruction for repetition, rather than a word with a direct color association. So the rule could be:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word, or sequence of words, three times in the Output.

With the given information, this is the most plausible deduction, but it should be noted that with limited examples and without more context, the rule may not be definitive for all possible uses of ""walm.""",0.9,134,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the outputs associated with each input, focusing on the patterns that occur when ""walm"" is present:

1. Every time the word ""walm"" appears in the input, at least three color words follow in the respective output. For example:
    - Input: dax walm zup walm --> Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow (Two sets of three colors following each instance of ""walm"")
    - Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm --> Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue (Triple red following ""walm"" and triple blue following the second ""walm"")

2. The color that follows ""walm"" seems to be dependent on the word immediately preceding ""walm"":
    - When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", ""green"" follows (triple).
    - When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", ""blue"" follows (triple).
    - We also have ""wif walm"", which leads to triple ""red"".
    - However, for ""zup walm"", we get a sequence of ""yellow"", but it cannot be concluded with certainty if it is because of ""zup"" or due to the fact that ""walm"" is at the end of the input as the same color repeats thrice in both cases.

3. ""Walm"" is never the first word in the input, so each appearance has a word before it that might dictate the output color after ""walm"".

Based on the information above, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

walm -> When ""walm"" appears in the input, it causes the next three color words in the output to be identical and this color is determined by the word immediately preceding ""walm"": ""dax"" leads to ""green"", ""lug"" leads to ""blue"", and ""wif"" leads to ""red"". The effect of ""zup"" on ""walm"" is uncertain and would need more data to establish a firm rule. 

Rule: ""walm"" indicates a repetition of three of a color, with the color determined by the preceding word.",0.9,134,walm

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,135,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer the potential meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""dax.""

In each example, the word ""dax"" is associated with the color green:
- Input: dax -> Output: green
- Input: wif dax wif lug wif -> Output: red green red blue red
- Input: dax bluf wif lug -> Output: green green red blue
- Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
- Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif -> Output: blue green yellow green green red

From the above examples, it is noticeable that every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green.""

Therefore: dax -> green.",1.0,135,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"", we need to look at the patterns and differences between the input and output for each example. Compare the inputs that include ""wif"" and their corresponding outputs to identify what ""wif"" translates to or what rule it might represent.

Input: lug walm zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow red

Input: lug walm wif bluf
Output: blue blue blue red red

Input: dax wif lug
Output: green red blue

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Input: zup dax wif
Output: yellow green red

Considering the examples provided, we can make a few observations:

1. Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, the corresponding output always includes ""red"".
2. When ""wif"" follows a different word, the color associated with that word in the sequence is reflected before ""red"" in the output. 
    - In the third example, 'dax wif lug', ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", so we get ""green red"" followed by the color for ""lug"" which is ""blue"".
    - Likewise in the fourth and fifth examples, the color corresponding to the word before ""wif"" (for ""zup"" it's ""yellow"" and for ""dax"" it's ""green"") appears before ""red"" in the output.
3. In the first example where ""wif"" is at the end, the color ""red"" is followed by an additional color ""yellow"". This implies that the position of ""wif"" at the end of a sequence might add an additional color to the sequence.

With these observations, we can formulate a rule for ""wif"":

Rule: When ""wif"" follows a word, it adds ""red"" after the color corresponding to that word in the output. If ""wif"" is at the end of the sequence, it adds ""red"" after repeating the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it.

Therefore:
wif -> When following a word, adds ""red"" after the color for that word. If at the end, adds ""red"" followed by an additional color that corresponds to the word before it.",0.8,135,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can infer a rule for what the nonce word ""wif"" represents by looking at the output patterns:

- For the input ""lug walm zup wif,"" the output is ""blue blue blue yellow red."" The word ""wif"" is at the end, and ""yellow red"" is at the end of the output sequence.
- For the input ""lug walm wif bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue blue red red."" Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and the corresponding output is ""red red,"" which is the same color repeated.
- For the input ""dax wif lug,"" the output is ""green red blue."" Here ""wif"" is in the middle, followed by ""lug,"" resulting in ""red blue.""
- For the input ""zup wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow red red red."" Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the output includes an additional ""red.""
- For the input ""zup dax wif,"" the output is ""yellow green red."" Here, ""wif"" is at the end, and ""red"" is the last color in the output sequence.

It seems that ""wif"" represents a rule where the following occurs:

- When ""wif"" is present, the output color sequence always includes a ""red.""
- The word following ""wif"" determines the number of repetitions or sequence of colors in the output. If ""wif"" is followed by a repeated word like ""lug walm wif bluf,"" it results in a repetition of ""red red.""
- If ""wif"" is at the end of the input sequence, the corresponding output is a single ""red.""

With these observations, we can attempt to generalize the meaning of ""wif"":

Rule: ""wif"" is a modifier that indicates that the output will contain the color ""red."" The exact positioning and number of ""red"" colors in the output seem to be influenced by the word that follows ""wif,"" its position in the input sequence, or possibly other contextual factors that cannot be determined with certainty from the given examples.

Therefore:

wif -> meaning: A modifier that indicates the inclusion of the color red in the output sequence, with details depending on context and subsequent words.",0.8,135,wif
"Considering the input-output pairs available, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""wif."" It appears that each word in the input corresponds to a certain color in the output, with the following seeming associations:

- lug -> blue
- walm -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- bluf -> red

Now we examine the occurrences of ""wif"":

1. In the first example, ""wif"" results in ""yellow red,"" following ""zup,"" which also converts to ""yellow.""
2. In the second example, ""wif"" results in ""red red,"" following ""walm,"" which also converts to ""red.""
3. In the third and fourth examples, ""wif"" results in ""red,"" coming after ""lug"" and ""zup,"" which convert to ""blue"" and ""yellow,"" respectively.
4. In the fifth example, ""wif"" yields ""red,"" following ""dax,"" which converts to ""green.""

Looking at the output sequences, it seems that ""wif"" replicates the color output of the word preceding it.

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" could be summarized as follows:

Rule: wif replicates the color output of the immediately preceding word in the input sequence. If ""wif"" follows a word that corresponds to a certain color, then ""wif"" results in the same color in the output.",0.8,135,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the patterns of colors associated with each word in different positions across the given examples:

- In the first example (""lug walm zup wif""), ""wif"" corresponds to the colors ""yellow red.""
- In the second example (""lug walm wif bluf""), ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"" and correspond to ""red.""
- In the third example (""dax wif lug""), ""wif"" is placed between ""dax"" and ""lug"" and again corresponds to ""red.""
- In the fourth example (""zup wif walm""), ""wif"" placed after ""zup"" and before ""walm"" is responsible for ""red.""
- In the last example (""zup dax wif""), ""wif"" comes after both ""zup"" and ""dax,"" and again stands for ""red.""

From these examples, we notice that whenever ""wif"" appears, it produces a ""red"" in the output. However, in the first example, ""wif"" produces two colored outputs, ""yellow red."" Since ""yellow"" does not recur with ""wif"" in the other examples, it appears to be influenced by a different word or pattern that is not repeated in the other inputs.

With the information given, we can establish that ""wif"" consistently produces the color ""red"" when it appears in the input, despite its position relative to other words. Therefore:

Rule: wif -> red",0.8,135,wif
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the color patterns that appear in the output with respect to the appearance of ""wif"" in the input. Each color in the output seems to correspond to one of the words in the input.

From the provided examples:
1. ""lug walm zup wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue yellow red.""
2. ""lug walm wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red red.""
3. ""dax wif lug"" corresponds to ""green red blue.""
4. ""zup wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red red red.""
5. ""zup dax wif"" corresponds to ""yellow green red.""

Looking at the examples, ""wif"" seems to equate to a color that is not associated with the other words in the input. In examples 1, 3 and 5, ""wif"" appears at the end, and the color red follows it in the output. In example 2, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and both correspond to the color red in the output. In example 4, ""wif"" appears second and corresponds to red, meaning that ""wif"" translates to red when it is not at the end of the input list, breaking the established pattern of example 2.

Based on this analysis, a rule could be deduced:

Rule: When ""wif"" is not followed by any other words, it corresponds to the color red in the output. However, it seems the presence of a non-matching word after ""wif"" tends to result in a duplication of the last referential color in the output. Thus, the rule for ""wif"" is context-dependent:

1. If ""wif"" is followed by a word that does not correspond to an established color, ""wif"" itself translates to red, and a new color red is introduced for the unknown word (as seen in example 2).
2. If ""wif"" is not followed by another word, it translates directly to red (as seen in examples 1, 3, and 5).

Rule: wif -> red (context-dependent).",0.8,135,wif

- ""zup bluf dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow green"", with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"", independent of its position.
- ""lug wif dax walm zup"" translates to ""blue red green green green yellow"", with the last ""zup"" resulting in ""yellow"" at the end.
- ""zup dax lug wif dax"" translates to ""yellow green blue red green"", with ""zup"" at the beginning corresponding to ""yellow"".
- ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"", with both instances of ""zup"" translating to ""yellow"", even when adjacent to different words.

"To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" we can look for patterns in the examples provided where the word ""zup"" is used and the corresponding output. 

1. In the first example, ""zup"" appears at the beginning, and ""yellow"" is the output's first word.
2. In the second example, ""zup"" appears at the beginning, and again, ""yellow"" starts the output.
3. In the third example, ""zup"" appears at the end, and ""yellow"" is the last word of the output.
4. In the fourth example, ""zup"" appears at the beginning, and once again, ""yellow"" is at the start of the output.
5. In the fifth example, ""zup"" appears at the beginning and in the middle positions. Correspondingly, ""yellow"" appears at the beginning and in various middle positions of the output.

In all instances, regardless of ""zup's"" position in the input sequence, it corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output sequence. There is no differentiation in output based on ""zup's"" position, suggesting the meaning of ""zup"" does not change with context within the given examples. 

Rule: zup -> yellow. ""Zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,135,zup
"Observing the inputs and outputs, the rule seems to be that the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. In each example given, each time the word ""zup"" appears, the output contains the corresponding word ""yellow"" in the same position.

When looking at the input and output containing ""zup"", we can see that it translates to ""yellow"" in situations where it is not preceded by ""walm"", which already translates to ""yellow"".

Rule:
zup -> ""yellow"" when not preceded by ""walm"" (which translates to ""yellow"").
In contexts where ""walm"" precedes ""zup"", ""zup"" doesn't seem to appear because ""walm"" covers the yellow meaning, making ""zup"" redundant in that specific case. However, this specific rule about preceding ""walm"" is an extrapolation; the examples do not provide a case where ""zup"" follows ""walm"". The rule is inferred based on the absence of ""zup"" following ""walm"" and the consistent translation of ""zup"" to ""yellow"" in all other cases.",0.9,135,zup

Input: dax zup lug zup bluf -> Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
Input: dax bluf wif zup wif -> Output: green green red yellow red
Input: lug dax bluf -> Output: blue green green

Considering that the position of ""bluf"" does not impact its Output (it is red when it follows ""wif"", green when it follows ""dax"", and blue when it follows ""lug""), we can determine that the rule for ""bluf"" is that it repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. 

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it.",1.0,135,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" directly translates to the color ""red"" when following ""wif,"" but translates to ""green"" when following ""dax"" or ""lug."" Therefore, ""bluf"" does not have a single static meaning, but rather its meaning changes depending on the preceding word. 

However, given that ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup,"" it seems that the rule can't be a direct 1-to-1 translation based on the preceding word either, as ""zup"" converts it to ""yellow,"" a color that isn't a one-step variation from the colors given for ""dax,"" ""lug,"" or ""wif."" Since ""bluf"" results in two occurrences of yellow after two occurrences of ""zup,"" it might suggest ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word, but this does not hold true in the ""wif"" and ""dax"" cases, where it does not take on the color of the preceding word, ""red"" or ""blue"" respectively. The examples don't allow for a definitive rule for when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup.""

Given the information and the inconsistency with ""zup,"" the best I can do with the given data is to identify the following pattern:

Rule:
- After ""wif"" -> ""bluf"" means ""red.""
- After ""dax"" -> ""bluf"" means ""green.""
- After ""lug"" -> ""bluf"" means ""green.""
- After ""zup"" -> ""bluf"" results in ""yellow,"" but this rule is not consistent and requires additional examples to establish a clear pattern.

"Given the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"" by examining the patterns and the resulting colors.

Looking at the output sequence, we can observe that after the word ""walm"" is used, the color that follows is a repetition of the color that preceded ""walm."" For example:

- In the first input ""zup walm dax,"" the color sequence is ""yellow yellow green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" induces a repetition of ""yellow"" before proceeding to ""green"" for ""dax.""
- In the second input ""bluf wif walm,"" we have ""yellow red red red,"" which again shows ""walm"" causing a repeat of ""red.""
- Similar behavior is observed in the rest of the examples, where ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color that came immediately before it.

Therefore, given these observations, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" in this context means to repeat the color that immediately precedes it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color that comes immediately before this word.",1.0,135,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided. We'll look at the color immediately following ""walm"" in each sequence to determine its meaning.

1. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   
   After ""walm,"" the color ""green"" appears.

2. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   
   The input ends with ""walm,"" and the corresponding output ends with ""red.""

3. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   
   ""Walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   
   The sequence ends with ""walm,"" and ""blue"" follows it twice.

5. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   
   ""Walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue.""

In each instance, ""walm"" seems to modify or affect the next word in the sequence such that the color equivalent of the next word is repeated once or more times afterward.

Based on the examples, ""walm"" could be inferred to mean ""repeat the following color."" This interpretation is consistent across all examples given.

Rule: walm -> causes the next color to be repeated one or more times.",0.9,135,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze how its output changes across different examples:

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

In each instance where ""walm"" appears, the word before it is differently colored, but the following sequence or repetition of colors in the output tends to be all the same until a new color appears (red in the first example, blue in the fourth, and so forth). It appears that ""walm"" induces a repetition of the last color mentioned until a new color code is introduced.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last mentioned color until a different color-coded word appears.",0.8,135,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we must look for patterns in its use across different sequences. Let's analyze where ""walm"" appears and the corresponding outputs:

1. zup walm dax zup dax wif -> yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
2. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red
3. dax zup walm wif -> green yellow yellow yellow red
4. dax lug dax lug walm -> green blue green blue blue blue
5. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue

Breaking down each instance and comparing where ""walm"" occurs with the output:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""dax,"" and the output is ""yellow green."" This suggests there may not be a direct one-to-one mapping for ""walm,"" as it doesn't lead to a single color.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" appears at the end of the sequence, and the output is ""red."" It is important to note that the color output is continuous, indicating it might be influenced more by what came before rather than ""walm"" itself.
3. In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and is followed by ""wif,"" with the output sequence continuing as ""yellow red."" This further supports that ""walm"" does not correspond to a fixed color.
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows a pattern of ""lug,"" and the output colors after it are all ""blue,"" which could be a pattern but needs to be confirmed with more examples.
5. The final example shows ""walm"" following ""wif lug,"" and the output sequence is a continuation of the color ""red"" with a final ""blue.""

From these analyses, it appears that ""walm"" doesn't direct map to a specific color or sequence of colors. Instead, ""walm"" seems to be a rule or function that causes repetition of the output sequence pattern of the preceding word or words until the sequence ends or a new word appears. To exemplify, after ""walm"" appears, the previously introduced color sequences continue exactly or with a single alteration at the end.

Therefore, the rule may be that ""walm"" repeats the last color mentioned before it until a new word is introduced or the sequence ends. A slight exception is the last example where it ends with ""blue,"" but we could possibly interpret ""blue"" as the default color when there's no previous information to repeat (since it's the end of the sequence).

Rule: walm -> repeats the last color output of the sequence preceding it until a new word appears or the sequence ends, with ""blue"" potentially acting as a default color when no other information can be repeated.",0.8,135,walm
"The examples provided suggest that ""walm"" affects the colors that come after it in the series. To deduce the rule, observe the changes that happen before and after ""walm"" is used.

1. In the first example, after ""walm,"" the colors ""yellow green"" are repeated, and an additional ""red"" is added at the end.
2. In the second example, after ""walm,"" only ""red"" is repeated three times.
3. In the third example, following ""walm,"" ""yellow red"" is repeated once.
4. In the fourth example, after ""walm,"" ""blue blue"" repeats twice.
5. In the fifth example, after ""walm,"" ""red blue"" is repeated once.

From these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the color directly preceding it to repeat until the end of the sequence, with the exception of the first example where there's an additional ""red"" at the end. This exception could be an error, or it could suggest that ""walm"" sometimes adds an extra ""red"" at the end for reasons not explained by the examples.

For the purpose of defining a consistent rule from the provided examples, we will disregard the possible error or unexplained exception in the first example and define the rule based on the consistent behavior observed in examples 2, 3, 4, and 5.

Rule: walm causes the output color directly before it to be repeated for the remainder of the sequence.

Therefore, walm -> causes the repetition of the color directly before it for the rest of the sequence.",0.8,135,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can induce that the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output at the same relative position.

Here's the evidence supporting this rule:

- In examples where ""lug"" is the only word (""lug""), blue is the only color in the output.
- When ""lug"" is preceded or followed by ""wif"" (""wif lug"", ""lug wif""), ""blue"" takes the corresponding position relative to ""red"" in the output.
- When ""lug"" appears with other words like ""zup"" and ""dax"" which presumably correspond to ""yellow"" and ""green"", ""blue"" is still in the output in the position corresponding to ""lug"".
- When ""lug"" is enclosed by the word ""wif"" twice (""wif lug wif""), we see ""red"" on both sides of ""blue"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" directly translates to the color ""blue"" in the output, maintaining its position relative to other colors.",1.0,136,lug

"Observing the examples provided, each instance of a unique word appears to correlate with a unique color in the output. The word 'dax' consistently results in the color 'green', regardless of its position in the input.

Based on this, the rule seems to be that the word 'dax' is a stand-in for the color 'green'. The number of times 'dax' appears in the input does not affect the output (as seen in the single-word input example), so the repetition implied by 'dax' directly translates to an equivalent number of 'green' in the output.

In every instance, when ""zup"" is encountered in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. None of the other input words consistently result in the output of ""yellow."" This pattern suggests that the word ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,136,zup

"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to decode what ""zup"" signifies. Each example correlates a sequence of words with a sequence of colored outputs. By examining the patterns, we can infer the meaning or rule behind the word ""zup.""

Reviewing the input-output examples:

- In every case, the appearance of ""zup"" in the input correlates with the appearance of ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""Zup"" does not seem to modify or affect the colors produced by other words in the sequence.
- The position of ""zup"" in the sequence does not matter; it consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""

Given these observations, the simplest explanation is that ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow"". The presence of other words in the sequence also maps to specific colors, but the word ""zup"" itself has a one-to-one relationship with ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,136,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the word 'zup' appears to be linked to the color 'yellow'. However, the exact meaning may depend on its position in the sequence or coherence with other words. To confirm the rule, we would need to consider the position and the role of 'zup' within different sequences.

Here's what can be observed:

1. Whenever 'zup' appears, 'yellow' is included in the output at least once.
2. 'zup' does not always result in the same number of 'yellow' outputs, which suggests the meaning could be more complex than a simple one-to-one relationship. For instance, in the first example, 'zup' is followed by 'bluf' and 'wif walm', which results in 'yellow yellow red red red'. In the last example, 'zup' is followed by 'walm lug wif bluf', resulting in 'yellow yellow yellow blue red red'. There is a pattern where 'walm' after 'zup' adds additional yellows.

After considering these variations, the most consistent pattern we can deduce with the given examples is:

Rule: 'zup' translates to 'yellow', and 'walm' after 'zup' increases the count of 'yellow'.

This deduction fits all of the given examples:

- In the first example, 'zup bluf wif walm', 'zup' leads to 'yellow', and 'walm' after 'zup' leads to an additional 'yellow' before the sequence continues normally.
- In the second example, 'zup lug walm wif dax', 'zup' starts with 'yellow', and 'walm' after 'zup' adds more 'yellow' before the sequence continues with 'lug' as 'blue', 'wif' as 'red', and 'dax' as 'green'.
- In the third example, 'wif walm dax zup', 'zup' as the last word leads to 'yellow' at the end of the sequence.
- In the fourth example, 'lug zup lug', 'zup' simply translates to 'yellow' in between the 'blue' colors from 'lug'.
- In the fifth example, 'zup walm lug wif bluf', 'zup' followed by 'walm' again adds additional yellows, followed by the colors corresponding to the other words.

Given these observations and the stated rule, 'zup -> yellow', and 'walm' after 'zup' adds to the count of yellow outputs. However, without more examples or explicit rules about how these sequences are formed, this rule is speculative and may not be comprehensive.",0.9,136,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that zup acts as a modifier that specifies the color of the word that follows it. Zup changes the color code of the following word. The rules of modification seem to be as follows:

- When following zup, ""walm"" changes from red to yellow.
- When following zup, ""lug"" changes from blue to yellow.
- When following zup, ""wif"" seems to remain red, which implies zup doesn't affect ""wif"" or it turns into yellow, which immediately changes to red due to ""wif.""
- No example with ""bluf"" immediately following zup is given, so we can't deduce its interaction. However, the presence of ""bluf"" in sequences does not affect the interpretation of zup when it comes to other words.
- ""dax"" following zup turns green rather than its standalone color, which is not shown but can be assumed to be different from green considering the pattern of other color changes.

However, there's not enough data to fully confirm the behavior of ""zup"" when followed by all possible words, nor is there data on whether the presence of other words in sequence affects the interpretation of ""zup."" Given the information available:

Rule: zup -> changes the color code of the following word to yellow, with the exception of ""dax,"" where it changes to green.

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""

- The second ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and continues the ""yellow"" color.

From these observations, we can induce a rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word, then, if another word follows, represent the color of the following word in the sequence. If ""walm"" is at the end of an input sequence, continue the pattern of the preceding word's color.

Notice that for the outputs following ""walm,"" except the last ""walm"" in the sequence, the next word's color is used in the pattern, not ""red."" This suggests that ""walm"" acts as a duplicator for the immediately preceding color and a place-holder that affects the following word's output when present. When ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, it simply duplicates the pattern of the preceding word's color.",0.9,136,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the colors associated with the word and its position in the input examples. Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup | Output: red red red green yellow
2. Input: dax lug wif walm | Output: green blue red red red
3. Input: dax walm wif | Output: green green green red
4. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax | Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
5. Input: dax walm zup walm | Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

Analyzing the outputs, we notice that every word has a specific color associated with it except ""walm."" The pattern of colors before and after ""walm"" suggests that ""walm"" takes on the color associated with the word that follows it. Here are the patterns:

1. ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" and the output color is red.
2. ""walm"" is at the end, and the next word would likely be at the beginning due to a cyclical pattern; since ""dax"" follows ""wif"" and is green, ""walm"" is also red.
3. ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the output color is red.
4. ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" (output blue) and later by ""zup"" (output yellow).
5. ""walm"" is first followed by ""zup"" (output yellow) and then by itself but takes the color of ""zup"" that follows it (yellow).

Given this information, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning: The word ""walm"" adopts the color associated with the word that follows it in the sequence. If ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, the color sequence is assumed to be cyclical, so it takes the color of the first word in the sequence.",0.8,136,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we are looking to define what the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to in terms of the output color sequence. Here's what we can deduce from the examples:

1. When ""walm"" is present in the input, we see a series of reds in the output, indicating that ""walm"" may relate to the color red. However, we must also consider its position and the surrounding words to fully understand its meaning.

Let’s look more closely at the examples:

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""dax,"" both of which correspond to red when ""walm"" is next to them.

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red
- Again, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is red. ""Dax"" here does not affect the output for ""walm.""

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- Here, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and both yield the color green. The sequence ends with ""wif,"" which produces red.

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
- ""Walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""lug"" with ""zup"" and ""wif"" following. We observe that ""walm"" produces yellow here, same as ""zup.""

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
- In this example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and both yield green. When ""zup"" follows ""walm,"" they both yield yellow.

These observations suggest the following:

""walm"" seems to take on the color of the word that follows it unless it is preceded by ""wif,"" in which case the output is red.

Rule: ""walm"" -> takes on the color of the following word unless it is preceded by ""wif,"" in which case the output is red.",0.8,136,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should examine the output when ""walm"" is present in the input and look for any patterns.

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- ""wif"" leads to ""red""
- ""walm"" leads to ""red""
- ""dax"" leads to ""green""
- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red
- ""dax"" leads to ""green""
- ""lug"" leads to ""blue""
- ""wif"" leads to ""red""
- ""walm"" leads to ""red""

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- ""dax"" leads to ""green""
- ""walm"" leads to ""green""
- ""wif"" leads to ""red""

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" leads to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" leads to ""blue""
- ""wif"" leads to ""red""
- ""dax"" leads to ""green""

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
- ""dax"" leads to ""green""
- ""walm"" leads to ""green""
- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""

From the above examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that follows it. If ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" which is associated with green, ""walm"" results in green. If ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" which is associated with yellow, then ""walm"" results in yellow. In the case where ""walm"" is at the end of the input, as in the second example, it takes the color of ""wif,"" which is the word that precedes it and is associated with red.

The rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it takes on the color of the following word, if there is one, otherwise, it takes the color of the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the following word in the sequence, if there is one; otherwise, takes on the color of the preceding word.",0.8,136,walm

Regardless of what precedes or follows ""lug"" (for example, ""wif,"" ""zup,"" or ""dax""), the color blue is always included in the output. Hence, we can deduce that ""lug"" likely means blue or is associated with the color blue in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,137,lug
"Based on the given examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" can be deduced as follows:

Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
Input: zup lug -> Output: yellow blue

Input: lug dax -> Output: blue green
Input: lug -> Output: blue

The common element in each output where ""lug"" is present is the color ""blue."" When ""lug"" is paired with another word, a second color appears in the output. However, ""lug"" on its own consistently results in ""blue"" being part of the output.

"Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Whenever ""dax"" appears as an input, the output is ""green.""",1.0,137,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" we can look at the patterns surrounding its usage and the corresponding output colors.

Examining the examples:

1. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   We notice that ""dax"" is followed by ""walm wif walm,"" and the corresponding output starts with three greens.

2. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   ""Dax"" is here followed by ""zup bluf,"" and the output begins with green.

3. Input: zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green
   ""Dax"" follows ""zup bluf,"" and the output ends with green.

4. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   ""Dax"" is the last word in the sequence, and the output ends with green.

5. Input: zup dax zup
   Output: yellow green yellow
   ""Dax"" is surrounded by ""zup,"" and the output is yellow, green, yellow, indicating that ""dax"" is represented by green.

Based on these observations, we can infer that the presence of ""dax"" in any input sequence corresponds to the output color ""green."" Additionally, we can observe that the position of ""dax"" in the input doesn't affect its associated output color; it is always green regardless of its position.

Rule: dax -> green. Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the output color ""green.""",1.0,137,dax
"To deduce the rule of what ""dax"" means within the context, we can look for a pattern in the outputs corresponding to the position of ""dax"" in the inputs.

- In the first input, ""dax walm wif walm,"" we have ""dax"" at the beginning and the corresponding output begins with green followed by a repetition in color every time ""walm"" is mentioned.
- In the second input, ""dax zup bluf,"" we see ""dax"" at the beginning, followed by ""zup"" and ""bluf,"" with the output being green followed by two instances of yellow.
- In the third input, ""zup bluf dax,"" ""dax"" is at the end, and the output ends with green after two instances of yellow.
- In the fourth input, ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" ""dax"" is at the end again, and the output ends with green once more with other colors before it corresponding to different words.
- The fifth input, ""zup dax zup,"" has ""dax"" in the middle, with yellow before and after it, and a green in the position of ""dax.""

From these examples, one could deduce that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,137,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" we must look at each example and the output associated with it and try to identify any patterns or correlation between the input and the output. Let's analyze the examples one by one:

1. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
  
   - ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" which is followed by ""green.""
   - ""walm"" is followed by ""red"" after ""wif.""

2. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

   - ""dax"" is followed by ""green.""
   - ""zup"" and ""bluf"" without ""dax"" in front are followed by ""yellow.""

3. Input: zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green

   - ""zup"" and ""bluf"" without ""dax"" in front are followed by ""yellow.""
   - When ""dax"" appears at the end, it is followed by ""green.""

4. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   
   - ""zup"" appears three times without ""dax"" afterward and is followed by ""yellow.""
   - ""lug"" is followed by ""blue.""
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""red.""
   - ""dax"" at the end is followed by ""green.""

5. Input: zup dax zup
   Output: yellow green yellow

   - ""zup"" without ""dax"" afterward is followed by ""yellow.""
   - ""dax"" between ""zup"" is followed by ""green.""

Based on the examples above, we observe the following rules:
- When ""dax"" appears before another word, it causes the following word to be associated with ""green.""
- When ""dax"" appears after a word or at the end, it is itself associated with ""green.""

Thus, we can deduce the following:

Rule: ""dax"" signals the color ""green"" for itself or the subsequent word if it precedes another word.

dax -> signals green",0.9,137,dax
"From the provided examples, we can see that each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to a color output following a certain pattern. Let's analyze the patterns and the corresponding colors:

- Whenever ""dax"" is mentioned, the following word or words result in a consistent color pattern until a new word is introduced.
- In the first example, ""dax walm wif walm"" results in ""green green green red red red"". This indicates that one repetition of ""walm"" becomes green until ""wif"" is stated, and then it turns red.
- In the second example, ""dax zup bluf"" results in ""green yellow yellow"", suggesting that ""zup"" is assigned green while ""bluf"" is yellow.
- The third example, ""zup bluf dax"", shows that ""dax"" at the end of the sequence still affects the preceding word, with ""bluf"" becoming green.
- In the fourth example, when ""dax"" is introduced after ""zup walm lug zup wif"", the output becomes ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green"". This implies that ""dax"" causes the color to shift to green for the next word, and the change persists until a new word appears.
- Finally, the fifth example, ""zup dax zup"", provides us with ""yellow green yellow,"" where ""dax"" being in the middle results in the word following it (""zup"") changing color once again.

From this, we can induce that ""dax"" acts as a modifier that changes the color output of the word(s) that follow it until a new distinct word is introduced. The color change seems to be predetermined for each word, as consistently ""walm"" turns green until a new word, and ""wif"" turns red.

Rule: dax -> The word ""dax"" functions as a modifier that changes the color associated with the following word(s) until a new word is mentioned. The color change follows a specific pattern depending on each word's predetermined color.",0.8,137,dax
"Rule: 

Based on the given examples, ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" is present in the output.

wif -> red",1.0,137,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" we need to focus on the constant output across different examples. The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input. The other words in the input lead to different colors, and it seems their position does not alter their corresponding colors.

Given the data:

- Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" always appears first in the output.
- The word ""wif"" by itself translates to ""red"" in the output.
- ""lug"" and ""dax"" seem to correspond to ""blue"" and ""green,"" respectively, evidenced by their consistent translation in the output when they are present in the input.
- ""walm"" when repeated two times, also results in ""green green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" translates to ""green.""
- ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""red,"" as in the last input, the word ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" in the output.

Based on these observations, the following rule can be deduced:

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" each time it appears. However, we must also consider the other words and their respective outputs to ensure the meaning of ""wif"" is not context-dependent.

Let's analyze each case:

- In the first input, ""wif"" is the only word and the output is ""red."" This suggests that ""wif"" could indeed mean ""red.""
- In the second input, ""wif lug"" outputs ""red blue."" We see ""wif"" again associated with ""red,"" and ""lug"" is likely associated with ""blue.""
- In the third input, ""dax wif"" outputs ""green red."" Here, ""dax"" precedes ""wif"" and seems to be associated with the color ""green,"" while ""wif"" remains associated with ""red.""
- In the fourth input, ""wif lug dax walm"" corresponds to ""red blue green green green."" We see ""wif"" with ""red,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""dax"" with ""green."" ""Walm"" is a new word, and given that it is followed by three ""green"" colors, it might signify a repetition of the color ""green.""
- In the fifth input, ""wif bluf dax walm"" maps to ""red red green green green."" We see ""wif"" with ""red"" again, and ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""red"" this case.

- In the longer sequence ""lug dax zup lug wif,"" the output for ""zup"" remains ""yellow.""

No matter the context, ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow."" Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,138,zup
"The examples show a consistent pattern where ""zup"" is always translated to ""yellow"". There is no variation in the output regardless of its position or the context within the strings:

Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow
Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red (repeat of the first example, confirming the pattern)
Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow (repeat of the second example, confirming the pattern)
Input: lug dax zup lug wif -> Output: blue green yellow blue red

So, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,138,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,138,zup
Rule: bluf -> repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it twice.,1.0,138,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" represents a repeating of the color word that precedes it in the sequence. This can be inferred from the fact that every occurrence of ""bluf"" is followed by the repetition of the word representing a color that came immediately before it.

Examples and Deductions:

1. In ""lug bluf,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" results in the repetition of ""blue,"" leading to ""blue blue.""
2. In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" seems to be irrelevant since it does not translate to any color here. ""Bluf"" repeats the color word before it, which in this case is ""yellow,"" leading to ""yellow yellow."" ""Wif"" is then repeated twice because ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" yielding ""red red red.""
3. In ""zup wif bluf,"" following the pattern, ""bluf"" repeats the color ""red"" which ""wif"" represents, resulting in ""yellow red red.""
4. In ""wif bluf dax,"" ""bluf"" repeats ""red,"" and ""dax"" is identified as ""green"" after ""bluf.""
5. In ""dax zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" repeats ""yellow,"" which is what ""zup"" stands for.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color word immediately before it.",1.0,138,bluf
"Rule: bluf means repeating the color denoted by the word just before it, twice. If the previous word signifies the color blue (lug), then bluf means blue repeated twice. If the previous word signifies the color yellow (zup), then bluf stands for yellow repeated twice, and so on for other colors.",1.0,138,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> duplicate the color word that follows it. If it is the last word, repeat the previous color word.",0.0,138,bluf
"bluf -> red red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to two repetitions of the color ""red"".",0.0,138,bluf
"walm -> ""repeat the color of the first word""

Rule: When ""walm"" is used in a sequence, it indicates that the color of the word preceding ""walm"" should be repeated for the number of times ""walm"" is used.",1.0,138,walm
"walm -> color of the object preceding ""walm"".

Rule: The word ""walm"" dictates that the color mentioned in the output corresponds to the color associated with the object immediately before ""walm"". When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the color is green; when ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", the color is blue.",1.0,138,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can come up with a rule for 'walm':

Whenever 'dax' precedes 'walm,' the output is ""green green green,"" and when 'lug' precedes 'walm,' the output is ""blue blue blue."" This suggests that the word 'walm' inherits the rule from the preceding word (either 'dax' or 'lug'). The word after 'walm' seems to determine the color of the final word in the sequence (e.g., 'wif' results in 'red').

Therefore, the rule for 'walm' appears to be that it copies the rule of the preceding word, which dictates the color of its output. 

Rule: walm -> copies the color rule of the preceding word. If 'dax' is before it, the output is green, and if 'lug' is before it, the output is blue. The following word, if any, has its own color output rule (e.g., 'wif' is red).",0.9,138,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to influence the output color, but the specific output color also depends on the preceding word. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is green. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is blue. The pattern suggests that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the previous word. 

Here is how the rule appears to work:

- ""dax"" by itself corresponds to a single ""green.""
- ""lug"" by itself corresponds to a single ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is three ""green.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is three ""blue.""
- The word ""wif"" generates ""red"" when it follows walm, regardless of the preceding word.

The non-repeating colors (yellow and red) appear to be unaffected by the presence of ""walm"" and are instead influenced by other rules not fully explained in these examples. While the word ""wif"" consistently produces a red output regardless of what precedes it, the introduction of the word ""zup"" produces a yellow output, but there is not enough information to form a concrete rule for ""zup.""

Here is the rule based on the examples:

walm -> meaning. Walm causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. 

Rule:
- ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" -> output is ""green green green.""
- ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" -> output is ""blue blue blue.""
- ""wif"" after ""walm"" -> add ""red"" to the output sequence.",0.9,138,walm
"walm -> meaning. 

Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to correspond to a repeated sequence of colors. In each output, ""walm"" results in a sequence of three identical colors, which seems to be influenced by the word that precedes it. Specifically:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""

Therefore, ""walm"" does not have a fixed color associated with it, but rather it represents a repetition of a color that is determined by the context it is used in. 

Rule: ""walm"" triggers the repetition of a sequence of three identical colors, and the specific color is determined by the word preceding ""walm.""",0.9,138,walm
"Given the examples provided, the rule appears to be consistent in associating the nonce word ""lug"" with a specific color:

- ""lug walm"" produces three ""blue,"" suggesting that ""lug"" correlates with the color ""blue,"" while ""walm"" seems to have no effect on the output in this particular instance.
- A single instance of ""lug"" consistently outputs ""blue.""
- ""lug zup lug"" gives ""blue yellow blue,"" implying that ""lug"" remains ""blue,"" and ""zup"" might correlate to ""yellow"" in this sequence.
- ""dax lug"" results in ""green blue,"" suggesting ""dax"" is likely represented by ""green,"" while ""lug"" remains ""blue.""

Based on these examples, we can deduce the following meaning:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,139,lug
"Rule: lug -> ""blue""",1.0,139,lug
"Rule: lug -> blue

This rule is consistent with each provided example where the word ""lug"" is present. Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words around it, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue.""",1.0,139,lug

Each instance of the word ""lug"" in the input corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the context or surrounding words.",1.0,139,lug
"Based on the provided examples, the following pattern is observed:

- ""zup"" always corresponds to the output ""yellow""
- ""lug"" always corresponds to the output ""blue""
- ""walm"" corresponds to the output ""blue""
- ""wif"" always corresponds to the output ""red""

The word ""dax"" corresponds to different outputs depending on its position:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green"" when followed by other words
- In the second example, it corresponds to ""green"", and the word that follows is ""red"" which is the output for ""wif""
- In the third example, it corresponds to ""green"", when following the word ""zup"" which is ""yellow""
- In the fourth example, it corresponds to ""green"" both times, appearing after ""wif"" (""red"") and before and after ""lug"" (""blue"")
- In the fifth example, it corresponds to ""green"" once again, appearing after the sequence ""red yellow red""

Considering these examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green"" regardless of its position.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,139,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following color assignments:

- ""zup"" always leads to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" always leads to ""blue""
- ""walm"" always leads to ""blue""
- ""wif"" always leads to ""red""

Given that ""dax"" is the only variable that changes output without a corresponding word change, its output must be independent of its position in the input string. In every case, ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green.""

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" is:

dax -> green",1.0,139,dax
"Based on the examples given, every instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Therefore, we can deduce the following meaning for ""dax"":

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""green"" in the output.",1.0,139,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following associations between the nonce words and the colors:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue
- wif -> red

Now, we will examine the occurrences of ""dax"" in the examples to deduce its meaning:

1. When ""dax"" follows ""zup"" the output is green (Input: zup dax, Output: yellow green).
2. When ""dax"" follows ""wif"" the output is green (Input: wif dax, Output: red green).
3. When ""dax"" stands alone after ""wif"" the output is still green (Input: dax wif, Output: green red).

Since the color associated with ""dax"" is consistently green regardless of its position or the preceding word, we can conclude that the meaning of ""dax"" is independent of context in the given examples.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,139,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the outputs. Every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the color green appears in the same position in the output. 

Here are the rules as per the given examples:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,139,dax
"Rule: wif -> red

Every instance of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,139,wif

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,139,wif
"Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red

The word 'wif' consistently translates to the color 'red' in the output, regardless of its position in the input.",1.0,139,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can observe that the output for ""wif"" is consistently ""red."" Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words around it, ""wif"" always translates to ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" is equivalent to the color ""red.""",1.0,139,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output every time it appears in the input. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,139,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,139,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red."" 

Here's how we arrive at this:

- In the first example, ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red."" Here ""bluf"" is associated with the second ""red"" in the output given that ""wif"" is consistently translating to ""red"" in all examples.
  
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" reinforcing that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when we again see that ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

- In the third example, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""blue red green green red blue."" Here, we can see that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which translates to ""green"" and is followed by ""green red."" Given the consistency of the other translations, it is reinforced that ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

- In the fourth example, ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" translates to ""green green red yellow blue."" Once again, ""dax"" is translated to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" with the output being ""green red,"" contributing to the pattern that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

- Finally, the fifth example is identical to the second, with the same input ""wif bluf"" and output ""red red,"" which serves to confirm the previous observations.

So, the rule is:

bluf -> red.",1.0,139,bluf
"Given the examples provided, we can induce the following pattern for the nonce word ""bluf"":

- In example 1, ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red,"" wherein ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red"" since it is consistent in all examples. By eliminating ""wif"" (red) and ""zup"" (yellow), ""bluf"" correlates with the remaining ""red.""

- In example 2, ""wif bluf"" translates directly to ""red red,"" reinforcing the idea that ""bluf"" corresponds to red.

- Example 3 and 4 introduce new words ""lug"" and ""dax,"" which seem to correlate with ""blue"" and ""green,"" respectively, based on the outputs. However, ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red"" when following the pattern.

- Example 5 merely repeats example 2, which strengthens the hypothesis that ""bluf"" always translates to ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> red.",1.0,139,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following pattern:

- In the first example ""zup wif bluf"", the output is ""yellow red red"". We can deduce that ""bluf"" results in the output ""red"" because ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". 
- The second example ""wif bluf"" confirms this as the output is ""red red"", showing that both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" output ""red"".
- The third example, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"", has the output ""blue red green green red blue"". Given the pattern, we can deduce that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""bluf"" once again corresponds to ""red"".
- The fourth example ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" with the output ""green green red yellow blue"" follows the same pattern with ""dax"" producing ""green"", ""wif"" and ""bluf"" resulting in ""red"", ""zup"" in ""yellow"", and ""lug"" in ""blue"".
- The final example ""wif bluf"", which produces ""red red"", again confirms that both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""red"".

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,139,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,1.0,139,bluf
"By examining the provided examples, we can try to infer the meaning or the rule for the nonce word ""bluf.""

Let's align each input with the corresponding output to see if we can discern a pattern:

Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red
- Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red.""

Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
- Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" also corresponding to ""red.""

Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> Output: blue red green green red blue
- Here, ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green."" ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and it is ""green"" in this context, yet follows ""wif"" to turn back to ""red."" ""lug"" repeats the initial ""blue.""

Input: dax bluf wif zup lug -> Output: green green red yellow blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and repeats the ""green."" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""

Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
- Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" after ""wif.""

Based on these observations, we deduce that ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color word that immediately precedes it. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it takes on the color ""red."" When it follows ""dax,"" it takes on the color ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word. If ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red,"" and if ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green.""",0.9,139,bluf
"Analyzing each of the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm"" by examining its context and the output sequences it generates. Here's what each example provides us:

- ""zup lug walm wif walm"" gives us ""yellow blue blue blue red red red."" Since ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" we can see that ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it. In this case, it repeats ""blue"" once and ""red"" twice.
- ""zup walm"" outputs to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and repeats ""yellow"" twice.
- ""zup dax walm"" changes to ""yellow green green green."" The ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" which leads to a repetition of ""green"" three times.
- ""wif lug dax walm"" yields ""red blue green green green."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and repeats ""green"" three times.
- ""dax walm wif walm zup"" converts to ""green green green red red red yellow."" The first ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and repeats ""green"" twice. The second ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and repeats ""red"" twice.

From each of these examples, we can observe that ""walm"" causes a triplication of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Triplicates the color associated with the preceding word in the sequence. If the preceding word corresponds to a color, ""walm"" outputs that color three more times.",1.0,139,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's start by examining the provided examples to look for patterns.

Input: zup lug walm wif walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
- Here, ""lug"" corresponds to one ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to one ""red."" ""Walm"" seems to follow ""lug"" and ""wif"" with three occurrences of the color they represent.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" on its own repeats the color ""yellow"" three times.

Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green
- ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" follows with three occurrences of ""green.""

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green
- ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" here as well, leading to three occurrences of ""green.""

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow
- The ""walm"" follows ""dax"" resulting in ""green"" and follows ""wif"" leading to ""red."" ""Zup"" at the end is just ""yellow.""

From these examples, it can be seen that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times. If ""walm"" follows a color word, the output is three instances of that color. ""Walm"" does not seem to have its own associated color; it depends on the previous word.

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the previous word three times.

- In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""zup"" gives yellow; hence ""bluf"" outputs yellow. ""wif"" outputs red twice, and ""walm,"" although it doesn't precede ""bluf,"" seems to be associated with red as well, following the pattern of ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,140,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" it is important to cross-examine each example and observe the pattern:

- In inputs where ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- In the input where ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- In the input where ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- In the input where ""bluf"" follows different words separated by space, the output for ""bluf"" is the same as the color corresponding to the word that precedes it.

From these observations, it seems that the rule for ""bluf"" is that it mimics the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it in the input.

Rule: bluf -> takes the same color as the preceding word.",1.0,140,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Examples:
- In ""dax zup bluf,"" ""zup"" is associated with yellow; thus, ""bluf"" also results in yellow.
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" is associated with red; thus, ""bluf"" also results in red.
- In ""lug bluf,"" ""lug"" is associated with blue; thus, ""bluf"" also results in blue.
- In ""dax bluf wif lug zup,"" ""dax"" is associated with green; thus, ""bluf"" also results in green.
- In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""zup"" is associated with yellow; thus, ""bluf"" also results in yellow.

Based on the examples, bluf -> meaning. Meaning: bluf takes the color of the word that comes before it.",1.0,140,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at how the word is used in different contexts:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated three times before a ""red"" appears. 
   Example: lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue 

2. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
   Example: zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow 
   
3. When ""walm"" is used in a sequence with other words, the color after ""walm"" seems to repeat three times unless another word interrupts the sequence.
   Example: dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue 
   
4. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and is followed by ""zup,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times before ""yellow"" appears.
   Example: lug walm zup -> blue blue blue yellow 

5. When ""walm"" precedes ""lug,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.
   Example: lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue 

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times. Therefore, ""walm"" can be interpreted as an instruction to repeat the previous word's associated color three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,140,walm
"Analyzing the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" translates into a sequence of colors corresponding to the color that is outputted directly after any word preceding ""walm."" Here are the observations that support this conclusion:

- When ""lug walm"" appears, the sequence ""blue blue blue"" follows. This suggests that ""lug"" outputs ""blue"" and ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color ""blue"" two additional times.
- When ""zup walm"" appears, the sequence ""yellow yellow yellow"" follows. This suggests that ""zup"" outputs ""yellow"" and ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color ""yellow"" two additional times.
- When ""lug walm zup"" appears, the output is ""blue blue blue yellow,"" which again follows the pattern of ""lug"" outputting ""blue"" and ""walm"" causing ""blue"" to be repeated before ""zup"" outputs ""yellow.""
- In the example ""lug zup walm lug,"" the output is a single ""blue"" followed by three ""yellow"" and ending with ""blue,"" where ""walm"" again seems to cause the repetition of the color outputted directly before it, which is ""yellow"" in this case.
- Finally, in the case of ""dax walm zup lug walm,"" we infer that ""dax"" outputs ""green"" and ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated, followed by a single ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and ""blue"" for ""lug,"" with ""walm"" causing ""blue"" to be repeated.

Based on these observations, we can express the meaning of ""walm"" as the following rule:

walm -> Repeat the color output related to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" two additional times.

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in the sequence, repeat the corresponding color of the preceding word two more times in the output.",1.0,140,walm
"Based on the given examples, the rule seems to relate to the word that precedes ""walm"" and determines the color associated with ""walm."" Specifically, when ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" and when ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" As for the input ""dax walm zup lug walm,"" which has ""dax"" before ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green,"" implying that ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" produces ""green.""

The rule that can be deduced is as follows:

Rule:
- If ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" then the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
- If ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" then the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- If ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" then the output is ""green"" repeated three times.

In the absence of a preceding word example for ""walm,"" no output color pattern can be deduced.

Hence, ""walm"" -> the output is the color associated with the preceding word, repeated three times.",1.0,140,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns:

1. ""lug walm wif lug"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue""
2. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
3. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" -> ""green green green yellow blue blue blue""
4. ""lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
5. ""lug walm zup"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow""

Now let's analyze by focusing on the occurrences of ""walm"" in the inputs and the patterns in the outputs:

- In the first and fifth examples, the word ""lug"" precedes and follows ""walm,"" resulting in ""blue blue blue"" and then a color change (to red or yellow) following the word after ""walm.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and results in a repetition of ""yellow"" three times, which doesn't give us much since there is no change.
- In the third example, ""walm"" appears twice: after ""dax"" and ""lug."" After ""dax,"" ""walm"" results in ""green green green."" After ""lug,"" ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" followed by a change with the next word.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" and results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" followed by a change with the next word to ""blue.""

From the patterns, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, three times. However, there is a variability dependent on the word that follows ""walm,"" prompting a color change after the repetition. We do not have enough data to induce a pattern for the color change that follows, as it seems dependent on the word after ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" to be repeated three times.",0.9,140,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns related to ""walm"" in the given input and output examples.

1. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   - ""lug"" appears at the beginning and end of the input, with ""blue"" at the beginning and end of the output.
   - ""walm"" is followed by another word, ""wif,"" which is not ""lug"" or ""zup,"" and translates to ""red"" in the output.

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and since there is one ""zup"" and the output consists of three ""yellow,"" ""walm"" could be contributing to the repetition.

3. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and there are three ""green"" in the output.
   - ""zup"" is present and translates to ""yellow,"" as it does in other examples.
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and it appears after a sequence initiated by ""walm,"" leading to repeated ""blue.""

4. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and there are two instances of ""blue"" matching the occurrences of ""lug.""
   - The presence of ""walm"" after ""zup"" (yellow) seems to repeat the ""yellow"" before it ends with the ""blue"" of ""lug.""

5. Input: lug walm zup
   Output: blue blue blue yellow
   - As in other examples, ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
   - ""zup"" comes after ""walm"" and translates to ""yellow"" as expected.

From the examples, the rule that seems to emerge is this:

""walm"" acts as a repetition indicator for the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Rule: When ""walm"" is preceded by another word, the color associated with that preceding word is repeated three times. If there are different words after ""walm,"" they are translated into their corresponding colors without repetition.

Hence, walm -> repetition of the color of the word before it, three times.",0.8,140,walm

Explanation: Across all examples provided, whenever the word ""dax"" is present in the input, the color ""green"" features in the output. This consistency suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

So in each case, regardless of the order or additional words:
- ""dax"" on its own results in ""green""
- ""dax"" combined with another word leads to ""green"" being the first color listed in the output, maintaining the association of ""dax"" with ""green.""

"bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue"".",1.0,141,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color ""blue."" In every instance where ""bluf"" appears, the output includes ""blue"" in the same position. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> blue.",1.0,141,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" consistently in the outputs, regardless of its position or the words around it. Therefore, the rule can be defined as follows:

Rule: bluf -> yellow,0.0,141,bluf
"Rule: bluf means ""yellow,"" but when it follows ""wif"" or precedes ""dax,"" it changes its representation to ""red"" or ""green,"" respectively. 

Therefore, the meaning of bluf is dependent on its position relative to other specific words:

- Before ""dax,"" bluf translates to ""green.""
- In all other positions, bluf translates to ""yellow.""",0.0,141,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""green"" each time it appears. No matter what other words or order are present, the output for ""walm"" is always ""green."" Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: walm -> green",1.0,141,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word walm is associated with the color green. Every time the word walm appears in the input, green appears an equivalent number of times in the output. It's also noteworthy that the instances of green are consecutive and directly correspond to walm's position within the input sequence.

To illustrate:

1. In the first input, walm appears twice, and in the output, red red red yellow appears both before and after two consecutive greens (the color for walm).
2. The second input features walm once, and there is one instance of green following its position.
3. The third input shows walm before wif, corresponding to three greens followed by a red.
4. The fourth input has only dax walm with no other words to follow, resulting in three consecutive greens for walm.
5. The fifth input places dax zup before and after dax walm, and the colors green yellow green appear before three consecutive greens, indicating the presence of walm.

Therefore, the rule for walm seems to be:

Rule: walm -> outputs an equal number of consecutive ""green"" colors corresponding to each occurrence of the word ""walm"".",1.0,141,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a sequence of three green outputs. Each example that includes the word ""walm"" results in ""green green green"" in the output. It is also important to note that ""walm"" does not appear to be dependent on a specific position within the input for this sequence to occur. 

Rule: walm -> a sequence of three green outputs.",1.0,141,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze how its presence affects the output in each example:

1. When 'wif walm zup' occurs, the output is 'red red red yellow'. These words without ""walm"" were not provided, but the repeated sequence allows for some inference.
2. 'zup dax walm lug wif' leads to 'yellow green green green blue red'. If we compare this to the baseline 'dax walm' which outputs 'green green green', we can attempt to identify what each word contributes.
3. 'dax walm wif' corresponds to 'green green green red', which is consistent with what was previously found for 'dax walm'.
4. 'dax walm' on its own gives 'green green green'.
5. 'dax zup dax walm' translates to 'green yellow green green green'.

Focusing on ""walm,"" it seems to produce a tripling effect of the color associated with the word immediately before it. If we consider 'dax' to mean 'green', then 'dax walm' would indeed result in 'green green green'. This tripling rule also seems to apply consistently, regardless of the word that comes before ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times.",0.8,141,walm
"Based on the given examples, the output color for each input word seems to be consistent, save for when ""walm"" appears in the sequence.

- The word ""wif"" always yields ""red.""
- The word ""lug"" always yields ""blue.""
- The word ""zup"" always yields ""yellow.""
- The word ""dax"" appears to generally yield ""green,"" but its output changes when ""walm"" follows it.

Examining the sequences with ""dax"" followed by ""walm,"" the output sequence is extended by additional instances of ""green."" The exact change seems to be that ""walm"" creates two extra ""green"" in the output after the ""green"" for ""dax"":

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" (where a single ""dax"" would usually result in just one ""green"").
- ""dax zup dax walm"" results in ""green yellow green green green"" (where ""dax"" at the end would normally only add one more ""green"" after the ""yellow"" for ""zup"").

Given this pattern, ""walm"" seems to cause the color associated with the previous word to be repeated two more times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Causes the prior color to be repeated two additional times.",0.8,141,walm

2. wif dax -> red green
3. zup wif dax -> yellow red green
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. dax wif -> green red

From the examples, we can observe that whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, one ""green"" appears in the output. Additionally, it looks like every other word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output, regardless of the presence of ""dax."" For instance, ""lug"" always results in ""blue,"" ""zup"" always results in ""yellow,"" ""wif"" always results in ""red,"" and ""walm"" always results in ""green"" when it occurs without ""dax."" However, when ""dax"" is present and precedes ""walm,"" the output is an extra ""green green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" might represent the phrase ""green green.""

Based on this information, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,142,wif
"Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.",1.0,142,wif
"From the examples provided, we can infer the following:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Thus, the meaning of ""walm"" in this context is that it triggers the repetition of the color associated with the previous word three times.

walm -> triggers repetition of the preceding word's associated color three times.",1.0,142,walm
"walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is preceded by another word, the output is the color associated with the preceding word, repeated three times. The associations are as follows:

- ""dax"" with ""green""
- ""lug"" with ""blue""
- ""zup"" with ""yellow""
- ""wif"" with ""red""",1.0,142,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word that precedes it three times. Here are the associations visible from the input and output:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

So, whenever the word ""walm"" follows any of these words, the output is the color corresponding to the preceding word repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,142,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Here's how it's deduced:

1. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" which suggests that ""dax"" relates to the color green, and ""walm"" causes this color to be repeated three times.
2. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting ""lug"" relates to the color blue, and, again, ""walm"" leads to the color being repeated three times.
3. ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" implying ""zup"" is related to the color yellow, and ""walm"" leads to thrice repetition.
4. In the complex input ""lug walm zup lug walm,"" we translate ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and since ""walm"" follows each, they result in ""blue blue blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue blue blue"" respectively.
5. Lastly, ""wif walm dax"" gives us ""red red red green,"" with ""wif"" being a new word that apparently relates to the color red, and ""walm"" again resulting in the repetition of red three times before proceeding to ""dax,"" which we have already deduced means green.

3. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" -> ""red red green green red red red blue red""
4. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""

Looking at the translation of each sequence involving ""dax,"" we see that ""dax"" at the beginning or end of a sequence translates to ""green."" We also notice that when ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"" or preceded by ""bluf,"" it still translates to ""green."" Additionally, in sequence 2, ""dax"" surrounded by other words also translates to ""green.""

"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we must identify any patterns or consistencies in its presence and the corresponding outputs. Let us analyze the given inputs and outputs closely.

1. Looking at the first input and output:
   - Input: ""wif zup""
   - Output: ""red yellow""

   ""wif"" alone corresponds to ""red.""

2. Analyzing further inputs and outputs:
   - Input: ""wif zup dax bluf""
   - Output: ""red yellow green green""

   Adding ""dax bluf"" to ""wif zup"" added ""green green"" to the output.

3. Third scenario:
   - Input: ""wif walm dax zup""
   - Output: ""red red red green yellow""

   ""walm"" must be responsible for the additional ""red"" outputs, and ""dax zup"" adds ""green yellow"".

4. Fourth example:
   - Input: ""wif lug dax walm""
   - Output: ""red blue green green green""

   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" leads to an additional ""green.""

5. Fifth example, in which only ""wif"" is followed directly by ""walm"":
   - Input: ""wif walm""
   - Output: ""red red red""

   Again, ""walm"" is linked to an additional ""red.""

Based on these observations, it seems ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Each instance of ""wif"" in the input results in the color ""red"" appearing in the output, and/or it influences the number of times ""red"" appears. ""Wif"" might serve as a multiplier for the color ""red,"" or as an initiator that must be followed by contextual words to determine the number of times ""red"" is outputted.

Using the results from each step to deduce the general rule:

Rule: ""wif"" -> red (potentially as a starting color with a repetition rule based on the following word). 

However, additional examples would be beneficial to fully confirm the rules regarding how ""wif"" influences the number of reds when followed by other words like ""walm."" Since there is not a clear rule about ""wif"" modifying the number of ""reds"" in correspondence to the subsequent words without further examples, this deduction is made with the available data.",0.9,144,wif
"Observing the examples provided, each instance of the nonce word ""wif"" generates an output pattern that includes ""red."" Moreover, the number of ""red"" colors in the output seems squarely dependent on the word that directly follows ""wif.""

Here's the apparent correlation between the following word and the number of ""red"" colors in the output:

- If ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" we see one ""red.""
- If ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" we see three ""reds.""
- If ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" we get one ""red"" and one ""blue,"" suggesting ""lug"" maps to ""blue.""

From the examples where ""wif"" is not directly followed by other words (apart from ""zup,"" ""walm,"" or ""lug""), we do not see a consistent rule about how many ""reds"" follow ""wif."" 

However, there's no example of ""wif"" being immediately followed by ""dax"" or something else to deduce the specific output rule for those cases. Additionally, the word ""wif"" itself does not seem to directly translate to ""red"" because it requires the following word to determine how many times ""red"" appears. Specifically, without further examples, we cannot ascertain if ""wif"" alone would result in any ""red"" at all or if its effect is solely contingent on the subsequent word.

Thus, based on the given examples, the most consistent rule we can induce for ""wif"" is that it precedes a pattern of colored outputs, and the immediate word following ""wif"" determines the number (and possibly the additional color) of ""reds"" in the output pattern.

Rule: ""wif"" serves as a precursor to a color pattern, where the immediate succeeding word influences the number and arrangement of ""red"" and potentially other colors in the output.",0.9,144,wif
"Rule: The word ""wif"" seems to determine the pattern of colors in the output, with each subsequent word translating to a specific color. The rule involves counting the number of letters in the word following ""wif"" to determine the output color.

- ""zup"" (3 letters) translates to yellow.
- ""dax"" (3 letters) translates to green.
- ""walm"" (4 letters) translates to three reds.
- ""lug"" (3 letters) translates to blue.

Therefore, ""wif"" initiates a pattern of colors where the number of letters in the following word(s) dictates the color(s) in the output, according to the specific rules inferred for each word.

wif -> Initiates a color output sequence based on the number of letters in the following words.",0.8,144,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" I'll analyze the pattern of the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Each output is a series of colors that seems to correspond with the input words. Let's map each distinct word to its associated color based upon the provided examples.

1. The word ""wif"" appears in every input and is always followed by ""red"" at the start of the output.
2. The word ""zup"" appears three times, and each time it is followed by ""yellow"" in the output.
3. The word ""dax"" appears three times and is followed by ""green"" in the output.
4. The word ""bluf"" appears once and is followed by ""green.""
5. The word ""walm"" appears twice, and it corresponds to three occurrences of ""red"" in the output.
6. The word ""lug"" appears once and is followed by ""blue.""

Given these observations, here are the proposed meanings:

- ""wif"" consistently results in the color ""red,"" but on closer examination, it seems that ""wif"" indicates that the following word's color should be repeated as many times as the syllables in that word. For example, ""walm"" has one syllable and corresponds to a repetition of ""red"" three times.
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""bluf"" has the same output as ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" implying that perhaps the output color is not strictly determined by the word itself but by some attribute of the word, such as the number of letters or phonetic components.
- ""walm,"" following ""wif,"" leads to ""red red red,"" indicating that, as noted above, ""wif"" might dictate that the word following it is translated into its color multiple times based on a rule, which in this case could be the number of syllables.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Therefore, given the examples it seems that ""wif"" influences the output based on a rule relating to repetition of color names, specifically, repeating the color corresponding to the following word based on the number of syllables of that word.

Rule: wif -> Repeat the color corresponding to the next word as many times as there are syllables in the next word.",0.8,144,wif

6. The color appears as many times as the word appears. For example, ""lug wif bluf"" results in ""blue red red"" where ""lug"" is before ""wif,"" which produced ""blue"" followed by two ""red""s.
7. ""Bluf"" on its own results in ""blue blue,"" thus it would suggest that ""bluf"" translates to ""blue."" However, ""bluf"" in combination with other words seems to not affect their output.

Given these observations, we can propose the following:

Rule: ""bluf"" represents the color ""blue,"" and the repetition of the color in the output corresponds to the occurrence of ""bluf"" in the input sequence.

- ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red"": Here, 'lug' before 'bluf' produces 'blue', and 'wif' before 'bluf' produces 'red red'.
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"": The word 'zup' before 'bluf' results in 'yellow yellow'.
- ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"": The sequence of 'zup walm lug wif' before 'bluf' results in the colors 'yellow yellow yellow blue red red', indicating that apparently 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', 'walm' has no direct output but might affect the number of repeats, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', and 'wif' to 'red red'.
- ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"": Here, 'lug' before 'bluf' results in 'blue blue', implying that there may be repetition when 'lug' precedes 'bluf' without another color word in between.
- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue blue"": This suggests 'lug' corresponds to a doubled 'blue' when followed by 'bluf', and 'wif' corresponds to 'red' but it is affected by surrounding words.

Given these patterns, I deduce that:

- ""bluf"" by itself does not have a color output. The colors depend on the words before ""bluf"".
- ""lug"" relates to the output 'blue' and may double the 'blue' when immediately followed by ""bluf"".
- ""wif"" appears to relate to the output 'red', and can double the 'red' if followed directly by ""bluf"".
- ""zup"" relates to the output 'yellow'.
- ""walm"" does not seem to have a direct color associated with it but affects the number of color repetitions.

A general rule for ""bluf"" cannot be fully defined without more information on how exactly ""walm"" influences the pattern.

Bluf -> The meaning of ""bluf"" is dependent on the preceding word(s) and may involve a series of colors based on a word-to-color translation, with repetition influenced by specific word order or presence of certain words.",0.9,144,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we'll examine the patterns and relationships between the inputs and outputs.

In the first example, the output ""blue red red"" corresponds to ""lug wif bluf."" Here, ""bluf"" must correspond to the word ""blue"" since ""lug"" has translated to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

In the second example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" We can assume ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" repeats the preceding color. So ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" in this instance because the preceding word (""zup,"" which is ""yellow"") is repeated.

The third example aligns with the second one, where ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" Here ""bluf"" again appears to result in the duplication of the color associated with the preceding word, which is ""red"" from ""wif.""

In the fourth example, the input is ""lug bluf,"" and the output is ""blue blue,"" further supporting the idea that ""bluf"" duplicates the preceding color.

The fifth example has ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" resulting in ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" In this sequence, ""bluf"" once again repeats the color that came before it, which is ""blue"" from ""lug.""

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" duplicates the color corresponding to the word that comes directly before it. If there is no color word before ""bluf,"" it defaults to ""blue.""

Bluf -> meaning. Meaning: repeats the preceding color or defaults to ""blue"" if no preceding color word is present.",0.9,144,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze each input and associated output. Here's what we notice:

1. When ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the result is ""blue"" followed by the color that corresponds to the word that comes after ""lug"" if there's another word before ""bluf"".
   - Example: ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red""
   - Example: ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""
   - Example: ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue blue""

2. When ""bluf"" is on its own after another word, it simply duplicates the output color of that word.
   - Example: ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""

3. When ""bluf"" follows a sequence of words, it turns into a sequence with each color corresponding to the preceding words, duplicated according to their occurrence before bluf.
   - Example: ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to relate to duplicating the sequence of colors that correspond to the words before it, with the addition of ""blue"" if ""lug"" appears directly before ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> take the sequence of colors from the words before bluf and duplicate each according to their occurrence before ""bluf"", starting the sequence with ""blue"" if ""lug"" is the word immediately preceding ""bluf"". If ""bluf"" is the only word or it's only preceded by one other word, then ""bluf"" simply duplicates the output color of that word.",0.9,144,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the output in relation to the word ""walm"" to derive its meaning or the rule it follows:

1. In the first example, ""zup walm"" resulted in ""yellow yellow yellow"". Since ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" on its own, the additional ""walm"" results in two more repetitions of ""yellow"".

2. In the second example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red"". Here, ""bluf"" is not given a color, and ""wif"" means ""red"". When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", it seems to repeat the color red twice more, similar to example one's repetition.

3. The third example has ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" resulting in ""blue green yellow green green green red"". We know ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""dax"" is ""green"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""wif"" is ""red"". Here ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" and repeats ""green"" two more times.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax walm zup lug walm"" becomes ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"". Once again, ""walm"" repeats the color that precedes it two more times.

5. Finally, the fifth example, ""zup bluf lug zup walm"", turns into ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"". After ""zup"", ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" two more times, disregarding ""bluf"".

The rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated two more times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color two additional times.",1.0,144,walm
"To deduce the meaning of 'walm,' we should look for commonalities in its usage across different examples. The key is to examine the relationship between the input and the output in each case.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
The only word that is unknown from this example is 'walm.' Since 'zup' translates to 'yellow,' 'walm' must translate to 'yellow' to produce the two additional 'yellow' in the output.

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
'zup' translates to 'yellow,' 'bluf' to 'yellow,' and 'wif' to 'red.' Here 'walm' again must translate to 'red' to produce the two additional 'red' in the output.

Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red
'lug' translates to 'blue,' 'dax' to 'green,' 'zup' to 'yellow,' and 'wif' to 'red.' 'Walm' translates to 'green' here to fit the output.

Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
'dax' translates to 'green,' 'zup' to 'yellow,' and 'lug' to 'blue.' 'Walm' in this context means 'green' initially to match with 'dax' and 'blue' at the end to match 'lug.'

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
'zup' translates to 'yellow,' 'bluf' to 'yellow,' and 'lug' to 'blue.' Once again 'walm' is associated with 'yellow' like 'zup' at the end.

Looking across all these examples, we can induce that 'walm' doesn't have a consistent one-to-one translation to a single color. Instead, 'walm' seems to repeat the color of the word immediately before it. So the rule for 'walm' appears to be that it takes on the color of the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word immediately before it.",1.0,144,walm
"Based on the examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. zup -> yellow (consistent across all examples)
2. bluf -> yellow red (once in an example)
3. lug -> blue (consistent across examples where it appears)
4. wif -> red (in the contexts it appears)
5. dax -> green (consistent across examples)

Each time the word ""walm"" is presented, the output is a repetition of the color indicated by the word that immediately precedes it. The number of repetitions of the color is equal to the number of times ""walm"" appears after that word.

For example:
- In ""zup walm"", ""zup"" means yellow, and ""walm"" is said once. So, one yellow follows.
- In ""zup bluf wif walm"", ""wif"" means red, and ""walm"" is said once. Thus, red is repeated once.
- In ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"", ""dax"" means green, and ""walm"" is said once. So, three greens follow ""walm"".
- In ""dax walm zup lug walm"", ""lug"" means blue, and ""walm"" is said once after ""lug."" Thus, blue is repeated three times.
- In ""zup bluf lug zup walm"", ""zup"" means yellow, and ""walm"" is said once. So, three yellows follow ""walm"".

Based on this, the rule can be deduced as: ""walm"" prompts the repetition of the color-associated output of the immediate preceding word, with the number of repetitions corresponding to the number of occurrences of ""walm"" after that word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color output of the immediate preceding word. The number of repetitions corresponds to the count of ""walm"" occurrences that follow.",1.0,144,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. 

Analyzing the examples:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Here, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and following ""walm"" repeats this color thrice.

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   ""Wif"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to red, which is then repeated three times.

3. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   The word before walm is ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, and following ""walm,"" green is repeated three times. ""Wif"" at the end corresponds to red.

4. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   ""Dax"" precedes the first ""walm,"" corresponding to three greens; ""lug"" precedes the second ""walm"" and corresponds to three blues.

5. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   ""Zup"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to yellow, followed by three repetitions of yellow.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.",1.0,144,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the relevant parts of the examples where ""walm"" is used and the pattern it produces in the output:

1. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
   Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" when followed by ""walm,"" it produces two more ""yellow"" in the output.

2. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""
   Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" is ""red,"" and ""wif"" hasn't appeared before. Since ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the output sequence ends with ""red"" repeated twice more, it can be assumed ""wif"" is also ""red."" ""walm"" will then repeat the color preceding it two more times.

3. ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" -> ""blue green yellow green green green red""
   ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" is following ""dax."" Here, ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated two more times in the output. ""wif"" appears after ""walm"" and corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

4. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" -> ""green green green yellow blue blue blue""
   ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""walm"" follows it resulting in two additional ""green."" Then ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" Here ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in two more ""blue.""

5. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
   ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" is ""red,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" ""walm"" follows the second ""zup,"" resulting in two additional ""yellow.""

From these examples, it's evident that when ""walm"" follows a color word, it causes that color word to be repeated two more times in the output sequence. 

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> Repeat the color stated before ""walm"" two additional times in the output sequence.",1.0,144,walm
"Based on the provided input-output pairs, it is apparent that ""lug"" consistently maps to the output ""blue"". Therefore, the rule that can be induced from the examples is as follows:

lug -> blue

Rule: Each instance of the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,145,lug
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of the context in which it is used. Hence, the rule for ""lug"" is as follows:

Rule: ""lug"" -> ""blue""",1.0,145,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.",1.0,145,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in every instance it is used.",1.0,145,lug
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"". Here's the analysis for each example:

1. Input: lug
   Output: blue
   Direct substitution.

2. Input: zup wif lug
   Output: yellow red blue
   ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"".

3. Input: lug
   Output: blue
   Again, direct substitution.

4. Input: wif dax lug dax
   Output: red green blue green
   ""wif"" translates to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"".

5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""walm"" does not seem to have a counterpart in the output, possibly meaning it has no color translation or is skipped, ""dax"" translates to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" as well.

Rule:
lug -> blue",1.0,145,lug
"Rule: 

dax -> green

The word ""dax"" results in the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. This is indicated by the consistent output of ""green"" whenever ""dax"" appears in the input.",1.0,145,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" is present in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output. Furthermore, the number of times ""green"" appears in the output corresponds to the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence. The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" the word ""walm"" also corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Each of these words, when in the output, is repeated a number of times equal to their position in the input sequence. Here's a summary of these findings:

Rule:
- dax -> green (repeated according to its position in the sequence)
- lug -> blue (repeated according to its position in the sequence)
- walm -> blue (repeated according to its position in the sequence)
- zup -> yellow (repeated according to its position in the sequence)

For example, if ""dax"" is the third word in the sequence, ""green"" will appear three times in the output. Similarly, if ""lug"" is the first word, ""blue"" appears once; if ""walm"" is second, ""blue"" appears twice, and so on.",1.0,145,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in a sequence or the presence of other words. It consistently translates to ""green"" in each given example.",1.0,145,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of ""dax"" appears to be related to the color green. When the word ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, the output is always ""green"" for that word.

However, the other words seem to follow a pattern as well:

- ""lug"" seems to correspond to the color ""blue.""
- ""walm"" appears to repeat the following word's associated color twice.
- ""zup"" seems to correspond to the color ""yellow.""

Let's apply this rule to confirm the pattern:

Input: dax
Output: green
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" repeats the color after it twice, so it results in ""blue blue blue.""

Input: lug dax zup
Output: blue green yellow
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""walm"" repeats the following color (which is ""green"" again since ""dax"" is before ""walm"") twice, so it results in ""green green.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- The second ""walm"" repeats the following color (""yellow"") twice, resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Based on this pattern induction, the rule for ""dax"" is:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""",1.0,145,dax
"Rule: dax corresponds to the color green. Each following word in the input modifies the output sequence not by color, but by the number of times the color should be repeated. The number of repetitions corresponds to the number of letters in the corresponding word. 

Thus, 'lug' with three letters results in 'blue' being output three times, and 'walm' with four letters results in its assigned color (presumably also blue based on 'dax lug walm' output) being output four times. 'Zup' seems to correspond to the color yellow, repeated based on its length (three letters, hence three times).

dax -> green",1.0,145,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red each time it is presented. Therefore, the rule is as follows:

wif -> red.",1.0,145,wif
"Upon reviewing the examples provided, the following observations can be made:

- In every output sequence, the word ""red"" appears exactly once.
- The word ""red"" appears at the position corresponding to where ""wif"" appears in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,145,wif

In this case, ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red. Let's see if this holds up in the other examples.

Second example:
- Input: dax lug wif walm

The position of ""dax"" in the input does not seem to matter; it consistently maps to ""green"" regardless of its place in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green",1.0,146,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the given input and output patterns. Here are the observations:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" is output.
2. The color ""green"" is only presented when ""dax"" is in the input.
3. No other word consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
4. ""Dax"" seems to function independently of its position in a sequence.

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: dax -> ""green"". Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green,"" regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the sequence.",1.0,146,dax
"Analyzing the input and output patterns, it seems the word 'dax' constantly corresponds to the output 'green' regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words.

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""

This consistency across varied contexts suggests a direct association between ""dax"" and the color green.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,146,dax
"By examining the examples provided and looking for patterns related to the use of the word ""dax,"" we can attempt to deduce the rule or meaning behind ""dax.""

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

When ""dax"" is present alone or as the first word, it corresponds to ""green.""

Input: dax
Output: green

""Dax"" on its own also corresponds to ""green.""

Input: wif dax
Output: red green

When ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" it still corresponds to ""green."" The presence of ""dax"" does not appear to be affected by the word that precedes it.

Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

""Dax"" appears here after ""bluf"" and still corresponds to ""green,"" reinforcing the idea that ""dax"" is consistently associated with ""green"" regardless of its position or surrounding words.

Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red

Here, ""dax"" appears twice and both times corresponds to ""green,"" even when it precedes different words (""zup"" and ""walm""). This further supports the rule that ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green. No matter the context, ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green.""",1.0,146,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". Each instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is ""red"". Additionally, ""wif"" seems to be independent of its position in the series, always resulting in the same output. Therefore, we can conclude:

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in the provided examples. Here are the instances of ""bluf"" and their corresponding translations:

- wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue
- lug bluf wif -> blue blue red
- wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
- wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
- lug dax bluf -> blue green green

Patterns to consider:
1. ""bluf"" is always followed by color words.
2. The output color that follows ""bluf"" is always the same as the color before ""bluf.""
3. ""bluf"" does not correspond to the same color in the output.

Based on these patterns, we can induce that ""bluf"" is a rule that duplicates the color that comes before it in the output. Hence:

bluf -> Duplicates the preceding color term in the output.",1.0,146,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for commonalities and patterns across the given examples:

1. ""wif bluf dax lug"" -> ""red red green blue""
2. ""lug bluf wif"" -> ""blue blue red""
3. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
4. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue""
5. ""lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue green green""

In these examples, we can observe:
- Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, it is translated to ""blue.""
- The word ""bluf"" seems to be independent of its position within the input sequence because it always results in ""blue"" no matter where it is placed.

Considering these observations, the meaning of ""bluf"" is consistent across all examples. Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> blue",1.0,146,bluf
"Rule: ""bluf"" represents a sequence of colors with ""blue"" being the first. Each time ""bluf"" appears, it adds one more ""blue"" to the sequence it represents. So the first time ""bluf"" is used, it outputs ""blue"", the second time it's used continuously, it outputs ""blue blue"", and so on with an additional ""blue"" each time it occurs consecutively.

bluf -> ""blue"" with an additional ""blue"" for each consecutive appearance.",0.8,146,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs:

1. wif bluf dax lug
   red red green blue

2. lug bluf wif
   blue blue red

3. wif bluf dax walm
   red red green green green

4. wif zup bluf lug walm
   red yellow yellow blue blue blue

5. lug dax bluf
   blue green green

Based on the given examples, we can see the following patterns:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" follows in the output.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" seems to result in a repetition of ""green"" (since ""dax"" comes before it and it also translates to ""green"").
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and seems to double itself in the output.

Now, let’s zero in on the use of ""bluf"":

- In examples 1, 2, and 4, ""bluf"" is immediately followed by ""lug,"" and the corresponding outputs are ""red red blue"" for the first two ""bluf"" and ""blue"" for the ""lug.""
- In example 3, ""bluf"" is immediately followed by ""dax,"" and the corresponding output is ""red red green"" for the two ""bluf"" and ""green"" for the ""dax.""
- In example 5, ""bluf"" is at the end of the input, with no word after it, and the output is a succession of ""green.""

From these patterns, we can deduce that ""bluf"" translates to a repetition of the color of the word that follows it. For instance, if ""lug"" (blue) is the next word, ""bluf"" outputs one additional ""blue."" When ""bluf"" is at the end and there is no word to follow, it defaults to ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> repetition of the color of the following word. If there is no word after ""bluf,"" then it defaults to green.",0.8,146,bluf
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word the same number of times as the number of letters in the word 'walm' (which is 4). 

For example, in the first input ""zup bluf wif walm"", 'wif' corresponds to the color red. Following the rule, 'walm' would then mean ""repeat the color red four times,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow red red red red"".

To correct this, here's how you apply the rule:

- ""zup bluf wif walm"": 'wif' is red, hence 'walm' repeats red x4.
- ""zup wif walm lug"": 'wif' is red, hence 'walm' repeats red x4 before 'lug' which is blue.
- ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"": 'dax' is green, thus the first 'walm' repeats green x4, then 'wif' is red, 'lug' is blue, followed by another 'dax' (green), and another 'walm', which again repeats green x4.
- ""zup bluf lug zup walm"": Here, the last color word before 'walm' is 'zup' (yellow), so 'walm' repeates yellow x4.
- ""lug walm"": 'lug' is blue, so 'walm' repeats blue x4.

Corrected Statement:
walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word four times.",1.0,146,walm
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word in the sequence.,1.0,146,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" acts as a multiplier for the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. Let's look at each instance of ""walm"" in the examples:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""Walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red. There are two ""wif""s and three reds in the output, suggesting ""walm"" repeated the color red.

2. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   - ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" and red is repeated.

3. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   - ""Walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is green, and green is repeated three times.

4. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""Walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is yellow, and there are three more occurrences of yellow after its first appearance.

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is blue, and blue is repeated three times concurrently.

The consistent pattern is that ""walm"" causes the color word before it to be repeated three times in total in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color represented by the preceding word a total of three times in succession.",0.8,146,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we will look for patterns in the examples provided that correlate with the word's presence and the corresponding outputs.

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

2. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

3. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green

4. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

Looking at examples (1) and (2), ""walm"" is followed by a series of ""red,"" regardless of the other words' presence (e.g., ""zup,"" ""wif""). In example (3), ""walm"" is preceded and followed by the color ""green,"" which corresponds with the word ""dax,"" but ""walm"" itself results in ""red."" In example (4), ""walm"" at the end of the sequence translates to a repetition of ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup,"" even though the preceding word is not ""zup."" Lastly, example (5) directly connects ""walm"" with repeated ""blue"" outputs, which are traditionally associated with ""lug.""

Observing the repeated color output whenever the word ""walm"" is present, it seems that ""walm"" has a rule of repeating the color related to the word immediately preceding it. Thus, we may deduce:

Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the word that comes directly before ""walm.""",0.8,146,walm
"To determine the meaning or the rule of the nonce word ""walm,"" let us examine the correlation between its occurrence and the changes in the corresponding output.

- When ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" the output sequence includes three reds (e.g., ""yellow yellow red red red"" and ""yellow red red red blue"").
- When ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" the output sequence includes three blues (e.g., ""blue blue blue"").
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output sequence repeats the color of ""dax"" (e.g., ""green green green"").
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" no extra ""yellow"" is added to the output. Instead, it continues the sequence of ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup"" (e.g., ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"").

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" reinforces or extends the color mentioned just before it. The rule appears to be that ""walm"" results in a sequence of the same color mentioned right before it, repeating that color additional times. The specific ""additional times"" depends on the previous word:
- If preceded by ""wif,"" it generates two additional reds, resulting in three total.
- If preceded by ""lug,"" it generates two additional blues, resulting in three total.
- If preceded by ""dax,"" it does not seem to add any additional colors but maintains the sequence of ""green.""
- If preceded by ""zup,"" it does not seem to add any additional colors but maintains the sequence of ""yellow.""

In other words, ""walm"" may mean ""extend the previous color"" in this context, with the number of repetitions potentially dictated by the previous word's established pattern or inherent meaning.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,147,wif
"Based on the examples provided, each time the nonce word ""wif"" is used, it is translated to ""red"". Here are the deductions from each input-output pair:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"", which means ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""bluf"" also translates to ""red"".
- In the second example, ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue"". Since ""wif"" appears once and the corresponding output is ""red"", ""wif"" refers to ""red"". ""Zup"" correlates with ""yellow"", ""walm"" also translates to ""red"", and ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".
- In the third example, ""wif dax wif lug wif"" translates to ""red green red blue red"". Each occurrence of ""wif"" translates to ""red"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""lug"" is ""blue"".
- In the fourth example, ""wif dax zup dax"" translates to ""red green yellow green"". ""Wif"" is ""red"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""zup"" is ""yellow"".
- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green"", confirming that ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""dax"" is ""green"". It also suggests that ""bluf"" and ""walm"" translate to ""red"" and ""green"" respectively, although ""walm"" was red in the second example.

Given these examples, it's clear that the word ""wif"" is consistently translated to the color ""red"", regardless of its position in the input string.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,147,wif

3. Input: wif dax wif lug wif -> Output: red green red blue red
4. Input: wif dax zup dax -> Output: red green yellow green
5. Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green

When ""wif"" appears, the output is consistently ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Additionally, ""wif"" does not seem to affect the colors associated with other words such as ""bluf” (red), ""dax” (green), ""zup” (yellow), ""lug” (blue), and ""walm” (green).

Hence, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be:

Rule: wif -> meaning ""red"".",1.0,147,wif
"Based on the outputs, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. The other words translate to a one-to-one correspondence with different colors (""bluf"" -> red, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""dax"" -> green, ""lug"" -> blue, ""walm"" -> green).

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,147,wif

Focusing on the occurrences of the word ""wif"":

- In every instance where ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output is ""red."" 
- ""wif"" remains consistent regardless of its position in the sequence, always mapping to ""red.""
- Other words such as ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""walm,"" and ""lug"" map to different colors, indicating that ""wif"" does not depend on the surrounding words to define its meaning.

"Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" whenever it is followed by the word ""wif,"" and to the color ""blue"" when it is followed by any other word or is at the end of a sequence. Here is the rule:

Rule: bluf -> ""yellow"" when followed by ""wif,"" and ""blue"" otherwise.",1.0,147,bluf
"Assuming that there is a direct correspondence between the nonce word ""bluf"" and a particular color in the Output, we can derive the meaning by looking for consistent patterns. We can see that whenever ""bluf"" appears in the Input, ""yellow"" follows in the Output, except when ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" or ""dax"", then the output is ""blue"" or ""green"" respectively. This suggests a pattern where the color associated with ""bluf"" might change based on the word that comes after it.

We can test this hypothesis further by observing examples where ""bluf"" is followed by both ""lug"" and ""dax"":

- In the first example ""bluf wif lug"" corresponds with ""yellow blue"", suggesting that ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" unless followed by ""lug"" (then it's ""blue"").
- In the second example, ""bluf wif walm"" and ""bluf"" on its own translate to ""yellow"" in both instances. This further suggests that ""bluf"" is normally ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" on its own translates to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, there’s no ""bluf,"" so this doesn't provide us with additional information.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"" produces ""yellow green blue blue green yellow,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" except before ""dax"" where it is ""green,"" and the ""bluf"" before ""lug"" it is ""blue.""

So, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" with the exception of when it precedes ""dax"" or ""lug"" where it is ""green"" or ""blue,"" respectively.

Rule: bluf -> ""yellow"" (default), ""green"" when followed by ""dax"", ""blue"" when followed by ""lug"".",0.9,147,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we will try to determine what ""bluf"" could mean in each instance. Besides ""bluf"", the words ""zup"", ""wif"", ""lug"", and ""dax"" are also repeated, and the corresponding outputs are colors.

Let's look at each instance where ""bluf"" is used:

1. zup bluf wif lug dax -> yellow yellow red blue green
2. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red
3. wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow
4. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
5. zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup -> yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow

Now let's see if we can figure out a pattern for ""bluf"":

- In example 1, ""bluf"" is followed by a ""yellow"" in the output.
- In example 3, ""bluf"" is the last word and is translated to ""yellow"" in the output.
- In example 4, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""green"" and ""yellow"", and it is followed by ""green"" in the output.
- In example 5, the first ""bluf"" follows ""yellow"" and precedes ""green"", with ""yellow"" and ""blue"" in the output, respectively. The second ""bluf"" follows ""lug” and precedes ""dax"", with ""blue"" and ""green"" in the output.

Given these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" at times translates to ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"" or is at the end, and translates to ""green"" when it follows ""dax"". However, when we have ""zup dax bluf"", we would anticipate ""yellow yellow green"", but the output is ""yellow green green"". Therefore, there's an additional rule affecting the output.

Looking carefully, when ""bluf"" is in the middle of the sequence (example 5), it seems to be ""blue"". This inconsistency suggests that the meaning of ""bluf"" is context-sensitive.

Considering all the observations, here's what we could deduce as the underlying rule for ""bluf"":

""bluf"" could mean different colors depending on the surrounding words and its position in the sequence:
- It may mean ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"" or comes at the end of a sequence.
- It may mean ""green"" when it follows ""dax"" and is not at the end.
- It may translate to ""blue"" when it's within a sequence, especially surrounded by different words or ""lug"".

This rule, however, may not fully capture the meaning of ""bluf"" as there might be another hidden rule affecting the output. So the rule seems to be context-dependent and not consistent across all examples. Hence, we might not have enough information to declare a conclusive meaning of ""bluf"". Given this uncertainty, a more examples are required to accurately determine what ""bluf"" means.

Rule: Context-dependent meaning influenced by neighboring words and position in the sequence (inconclusive with given examples).",0.5,147,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" However, when ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" it changes to the color ""green."" Therefore, ""bluf"" on its own means ""yellow,"" but ""bluf"" followed by ""dax"" means ""green.""

bluf -> yellow, except when followed by dax, then bluf -> green.",0.0,147,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it can be deduced that the nonce word ""bluf"" directly translates to the color ""yellow."" However, this is contradicted by later examples where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""green."" Therefore, ""bluf"" does not have a consistent direct translation to a single color.

Another approach to understand what ""bluf"" means could be based on its position in the sequence or the context it is used in. However, there is no clear pattern concerning its position because it can occur at the beginning, middle, or end of the sequence.

Given the disparate outputs corresponding with occurrences of ""bluf,"" it seems that ""bluf"" may influence the color output of the subsequent word rather than correspond to a particular color itself. It appears to create a context where the subsequent word's output is modified. For instance, when ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" or ""lug,"" those words typically translate to ""green"" and ""blue,"" respectively, but when preceded by ""bluf,"" the pattern is altered.

To deduce a more precise rule, let's reconsider the examples with some additional assumptions:

1. The other words could have consistent translations: ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""
2. The word ""walm"" appears to translate consistently to ""red.""
3. When ""bluf"" follows a word, it doesn't seem to affect the color translation of that word.
4. When ""bluf"" precedes a word, it might change the color translation of that word.

Under these assumptions, however, there is still not enough consistent information to deduct how ""bluf"" affects the subsequent word's color translation. For example, ""bluf"" followed by ""wif"" does not change ""wif"" to ""red"" since ""wif"" already translates to ""red."" Additionally, the output color could be influenced by the combination of the preceding word and ""bluf.""

The problem at hand does not provide sufficient consistency to determine a clear rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" without further examples or clarification. It's possible that ""bluf"" is a variable modifier whose effect on subsequent words cannot be singularly determined based on these examples alone.

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is inconsistent across given examples and may be contextually or positionally dependent, modifying the color output of subsequent words in a way that is not clear from the given data.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word just before it three times. The rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it takes the color tied to the preceding word and triples its occurrence in the output.

1. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   (""wif"" translates to ""red"" and is followed by ""red"" three times)

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   (Again, ""wif"" is ""red"" and is followed by ""red"" three times)

3. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   (""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and is followed by ""yellow"" three times)

4. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   (""dax"" is ""green"" and ""walm"" repeats it three times, ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""walm"" repeats it three times, and ""zup"" is ""yellow"")

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   (""wif"" is ""red"" and is followed by ""red"" three times)

From this analysis, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,147,walm
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.,1.0,147,walm
"The presented examples provide patterns from which we can induce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Let's analyze:

1. Input: dax wif walm | Output: green red red red
2. Input: wif walm | Output: red red red
3. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm | Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
4. Input: dax walm wif walm zup | Output: green green green red red red yellow
5. Input: zup wif walm | Output: yellow red red red

Notice that in each output, the appearance of ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color that immediately precedes it.

- In example 1, ""dax"" is green, followed by ""wif walm,"" which yields ""red red red."" Here, ""walm"" causes the preceding red to repeat twice more.
- In example 3, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" and we see ""yellow yellow yellow,"" implying that ""walm"" results in two additional repetitions of the yellow color.
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""wif,"" first repeating green twice, and then red twice, consistent with this pattern.

Therefore, the word ""walm"" indicates a rule to repeat the color represented by the word immediately before ""walm"" two additional times.

Rule: walm -> repeats the previous color twice more.",1.0,147,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word preceding it three times. For instance, if the color associated with ""wif"" is red, then ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red.""",1.0,147,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the term ""lug"" can be deduced to consistently correspond to the color blue. Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" is included in the output. The additional terms ""dax,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup"" correlate with other colors: green, red, and yellow respectively.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in the given examples. Each instance of ""lug"" consistently results in the output ""blue,"" regardless of the other words present in the input.",1.0,148,lug
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the word ""dax"" can be deduced by comparing the input and the corresponding output colors. 

In each example, ""dax"" corresponds to the output color ""green"". Notice that the word preceding ""dax"" is not consistent, so ""dax"" itself directly translates to the color ""green"" regardless of the context provided in the examples.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,148,dax
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" is associated with the output ""green."" It does not seem to depend on the context of the preceding or following words since ""dax"" consistently correlates with ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present. Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" is relatively straightforward:

dax -> green

Rule: When ""dax"" is present in the input, the output is ""green"".",1.0,148,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green."" Below are the corresponding inputs and outputs with ""dax"" highlighted:

1. ""zup **dax** walm zup wif"" -> yellow **green** green green yellow red
2. ""lug **dax**"" -> blue **green**
3. ""zup lug **dax** lug"" -> yellow blue **green** blue
4. ""lug wif **dax**"" -> blue red **green**
5. ""zup lug wif **dax** bluf wif"" -> yellow blue red **green** green red

In all cases, regardless of the context or the words that come before or after ""dax,"" the word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green",1.0,148,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at each instance of its use across the examples and the output that follows it.

- In the first example, ""dax"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""walm zup wif,"" and the output is ""green green.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" is preceded by ""lug"" with no following words, and the output is ""green.""
- The third example has ""dax"" preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""lug,"" with the output being ""green.""
- The fourth example shows ""dax"" following ""lug wif"" and the output is ""green.""
- In the final example, ""dax"" is preceded by ""zup lug wif"" and followed by ""bluf wif,"" and the output again for ""dax"" is ""green.""

Based on these observations, every time ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" is used in the output, regardless of the words that precede or follow it.

Hence, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,148,dax
"Using the given examples, the word ""dax"" seems to correspond to the output ""green."" This is supported by the fact that every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position of the output, regardless of the other words around it. 

Therefore, the rule seems to be: 

dax -> meaning: ""dax"" means ""green."" 

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears, translate it as ""green.""",1.0,148,dax
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,148,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Every instance of ""wif"" in the input results in ""red"" in the output. Thus, we can write the rule as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,148,wif
"Based on the examples given, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color red. In each instance where ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" appears the same number of times in the output.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,148,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""",1.0,148,wif
"Based on the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Each example shows that whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,148,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the context within the provided examples.",1.0,148,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow.,1.0,148,zup

Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,148,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in each of the given examples.",1.0,148,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the patterns associated with its occurrences and the subsequent outputs.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to a double ""red"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" and before ""zup."" Since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" results in a double red, the meaning does not seem dependent on its position.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and produces a double ""red"" again, reinforcing the idea that ""bluf"" means a double appearance of the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it.
- The fourth example shows ""bluf"" following ""zup"" with the resulting output of another double yellow.
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is double ""green.""

Each time, ""bluf"" results in the color corresponding to the word before it being doubled in the output.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

bluf -> The word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

Rule: When ""bluf"" is present, duplicate the color that corresponds to the preceding word in the output sequence.",1.0,148,bluf
"Rule: ""bluf"" correlates to the color that comes after the color signified by the word right before ""bluf"" in the sequence of primary and secondary colors (red, yellow, blue, green).

- In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and since ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""bluf"" results in two reds because, according to the color sequence, red follows yellow.
- In the second example, ""wif"" (red) precedes ""bluf"" and is followed by ""zup"" (yellow), which fits the color sequence.
- In the third example, ""wif"" (red) precedes ""bluf"" and is followed by ""zup"" (yellow), which also fits the color sequence.
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" (yellow) precedes ""bluf"" and is followed by ""lug"" (blue), which fits the sequence.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" (green) precedes ""bluf,"" and since ""dax"" is the last in the color sequence method, it will start over after green, resulting in two greens for ""bluf.""

Hence, bluf -> meaning. Meaning: ""bluf"" represents two instances of the color following the color represented by the preceding word in a primary and secondary color sequence.",1.0,148,bluf
"From the given examples, we can induce the following patterns for each word:

- Each occurrence of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- Each occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- Each occurrence of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- We can also see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we look at the translated output colors following its appearance in each example:

1. In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""red red red"", which correspond to ""wif wif wif"". Since ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" we can initially hypothesize that ""bluf"" might mean ""repeat the next color.""

2. In ""zup wif bluf zup,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""red yellow,"" which correspond to ""wif zup"". This supports the hypothesis that ""bluf"" means ""repeat the next color,"" as ""wif"" is red and ""zup"" is yellow.

3. In ""wif bluf zup,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""red yellow"" again. This is the same pattern as before, supporting our hypothesis.

4. In ""wif zup bluf lug,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow blue,"" which correspond to the ""zup lug"". Once again ""bluf"" seems to call for a repetition of the subsequent colors.

5. In ""lug wif lug dax bluf,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""green green,"" which correspond to ""dax dax"". Again, ""bluf"" prefaces the repetition of the next word's color, which is green in this case.

Given these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" instructs to repeat the color(s) of the next word (or words) in the sequence. However, there is an additional observation to be made. In examples where ""bluf"" is present, the color red never follows after ""bluf,"" even when ""wif"" is present elsewhere in the sequence. This pattern might simply be a coincidence based on the examples provided or a feature of the data not explicitly outlined.

Based on the above analysis, we can formulate the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeat the color of the next word in the sequence.",0.9,148,bluf
"Analyzing the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to different colors based on its position in the input sequence. Here are the rules that can be deduced from the examples given:

- In the first position after ""zup"", it corresponds to ""red"".
- In the second position after ""zup"", it corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In the last position of the sequence, if preceded by ""lug"", it corresponds to ""blue"".
- In the last position of the sequence, if preceded by ""dax"", it corresponds to ""green"".

Now, let's match the rules to individual examples to see if they hold true:

Example 1: zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red

- ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and so has the color ""red"".

Example 2: zup wif bluf zup -> yellow red red yellow

- ""bluf"" comes as the second word after ""zup"" so corresponds to ""yellow"".

Example 3: wif bluf zup -> red red yellow

- ""bluf"" is the second word, and though it does not come after ""zup"", it corresponds to ""red"" since that's the only rule that fits given we don't have examples of ""bluf"" without preceding ""zup"".

Example 4: wif zup bluf lug -> red yellow yellow blue

- ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" here and is in the last position of the sequence. According to the rules we're following, it should then be ""blue"".

Example 5: lug wif lug dax bluf -> blue red blue green green

- ""bluf"" is in the last position and is preceded by ""dax"", and it corresponds to ""green"".

The rules seem consistent with the given examples, resulting in:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on its position and the context of the surrounding words. It takes on different colors, changing based on specific preceding words like ""zup"", ""dax"", or ""lug"", and seemingly on its order following ""zup"".

bluf -> meaning depends on context and position: after ""zup"" -> ""red"", second after ""zup"" -> ""yellow"", last after ""lug"" -> ""blue"", last after ""dax"" -> ""green"".",0.8,148,bluf
"To determine what ""bluf"" means, we need to analyze the patterns for how it translates to colors in the output. Let's examine each example where ""bluf"" appears:

1. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
2. zup wif bluf zup -> yellow red red yellow
3. wif bluf zup -> red red yellow
4. wif zup bluf lug -> red yellow yellow blue
5. lug wif lug dax bluf -> blue red blue green green

From these examples, we can notice the following patterns:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the corresponding color is red (Examples 1, 2, 3).
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the corresponding color is yellow (Example 4).
- When ""bluf"" is the last word in the sequence, the corresponding color is the next iteration of the sequence starting from red (Example 5: after green comes green again).

Considering these patterns and their exceptions, it seems like ""bluf"" can vary in meaning depending on its position and/or the words that come before or after it. However, based on the available examples, we can try to deduce a rule:

When ""bluf"" follows:
- ""zup,"" it corresponds to red.
- ""wif,"" it corresponds to yellow.
- When ""bluf"" is the last word and the word before it is not ""zup"" or ""wif,"" it increments or repeats the color from a sequence starting with red.

Given this, the potential rule could be that ""bluf"" means an incrementing or repeating color, based on certain conditions related to the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> the color following red in the sequence or repeat the last color if it is the last word in the sequence without ""zup"" or ""wif"" before it, and red if preceded by ""zup,"" yellow if preceded by ""wif.""",0.6,148,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce that the word ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that precedes it three times. Here are the associations we can confirm from the given examples:

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" so ""dax"" is associated with the color green.
- ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red,"" which links ""wif"" to the color red.
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" establishing ""lug"" as the word for the color blue.

Additional context from the third and fourth examples helps to verify this pattern by showing the correct repetition even in varied positions within the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> blue",1.0,149,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" when translated from the input to the output. Additionally, there seems to be a rule that when ""bluf"" follows another word, the color corresponding to that previous word is not mentioned twice in the output last ""lug"" in the first input and the second ""wif"" in the fourth input). However, when ""bluf"" precedes the same word, the color is repeated in the output (""walm"" in the fourth input is translated as ""blue blue blue"").

Here's the formulated rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" means ""blue"". When ""bluf"" follows a different word representing a color, it results in the color ""blue"" following the previously mentioned color without repetition in the output. If ""bluf"" precedes a word, the word's corresponding color is repeated according to the number of times ""bluf"" appears before it.",0.8,149,bluf
"Based on the given examples, each instance of the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color in the output, with the output color following a rule based on the sequence of words before it. Let's examine the patterns:

1. In sequences where ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output color for ""bluf"" is blue.
2. In sequences where ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output color for ""bluf"" is red.
3. In sequences where ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output color for ""bluf"" is yellow.

5. This may suggest that the color represented by ""bluf"" might depend on the entire sequence or context preceding it or that there may be a mistake in this particular example.

Given the regularity in the first three examples and the irregularity in the last example, we might tentatively conclude:

bluf -> meaning. The color blue if preceded by ""lug,"" red if preceded by ""wif,"" and yellow if preceded by ""zup.""

There might be an inconsistency with the last example or additional context that we are not privy to.",0.8,149,bluf
bluf -> yellow,0.0,149,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can infer that 'walm' acts as a repeating amplifier for the color that comes before it, duplicating the color word in the output. Here's the reasoning behind that deduction:

- In the first example, 'dax lug dax lug walm' translates to 'green blue green blue blue blue'. After 'walm' appears, the previous color 'blue' is repeated.

- In the second and third examples, 'dax walm wif walm zup' and 'dax walm wif zup', 'walm' comes after 'dax' and 'wif,' and in both cases, the color that comes directly before 'walm' is repeated, 'green green green' and 'red red red' respectively for 'dax walm' and 'wif walm'. 

- The fourth example, 'dax walm wif bluf', further supports this rule as 'bluf' directly follows 'wif' and after 'bluf' we end up with 'red red', which is the color for 'wif', doubled.

- The fifth example, 'wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug', demonstrates the same repeating behavior for 'lug' with 'blue blue blue' after 'walm'. 

Therefore, the rule for 'walm' can be articulated as:

Rule: 'walm' -> Repeat the color word of the preceding term in the output.",1.0,149,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can notice that the output associated with ""walm"" depends on the word that precedes it. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   Since ""lug"" normally corresponds to ""blue"" and is followed by a double ""blue"" when ""walm"" appears, it suggests that ""walm"" might repeat the color of the previous word.

2. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   Here ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". Each instance of ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word.

3. Input: dax walm wif zup

   Again, ""walm"" repeats the color green after ""dax"" (green).

4. Input: dax walm wif bluf

   ""Walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"" (green) and ""bluf"" is red.

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug

In summary, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,149,walm
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the word ""walm"" appears to be related to repeating the following color's name a number of times equal to the number of syllables in the color's name. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" is followed by ""blue blue,"" which aligns with ""blue"" having one syllable so it's repeated once more (totaling two times).
- In the second and fourth examples, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated once (two times in total), this is consistent since ""red"" has one syllable.
- In the second example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is listed three times because ""yellow"" has two syllables.
- In the third example, ""wif"" translates to ""red"" followed by ""walm"" and then just ""red"" one more time, consistent with the prior rule.
- The last example starts with ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug,"" translating to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue."" Here, ""lug"" (blue) appears once, followed by ""walm"" and then ""blue"" is repeated, while ""dax"" (green) appears without repetition as ""green"" has only one syllable.

Considering this, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" appears before a color, repeat that color's name as many times as the number of syllables in that color name minus one (since the color name will already have been said once).

Hence, walm -> Repeat the next color's name an additional number of times equal to the number of syllables in that color's name minus one.",0.9,149,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" it is important to analyze the patterns of how it is used in each sequence and the corresponding color outputs.

Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue
Rule: Following a pattern of green and blue, walm results in an output of two blues in a row, which does not match the prior color-coding.

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow
Rule: Here, walm is followed by ""wif"" and then another ""walm,"" and the pattern is three greens followed by two reds each time a ""walm"" appears, ending with a yellow for ""zup.""

Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow
Rule: Just like the previous sequence, ""walm"" after ""dax"" leads to another green, followed by a sequence of red and yellow corresponding to ""wif"" and ""zup.""

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red
Rule: ""walm"" continues the color of ""dax"" which is green, followed by a ""wif"" which translates to red, and ""bluf"" does not have a clear pattern, but here it results in another red.

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
Rule: In this sequence, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" which translates to blue and followed by ""dax"" which is green. Here ""walm"" results in the colors blue and green, a combination of the colors of the words that come right after ""walm"" (green) and the one preceding it (blue).

From these examples, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it. In the singular instance where ""walm"" starts the sequence, the following outputs don't provide a clear pattern, but in every other instance it duplicates the preceding color or pattern.

Rule: walm -> duplicates the color of the previous word (or pattern), and when occurring at the beginning of a sequence, it may begin a new pattern which is not yet discernible.",0.8,149,walm
"Given the examples provided, walm appears to introduce a repetition of the color assigned to the word that immediately precedes it. Here's how it works in each example:

1. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   Here, walm repeats the color of the word before it, which is lug, corresponding to blue.

2. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   The first walm repeats the color of dax (green). The second walm repeats the color of wif (red).

3. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
   Here, walm repeats the color of dax (green).

4. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   Walm repeats the color of dax (green), and then, there's no walm, but bluf follows the pattern, assigning red to wif and repeating it.

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   Here, walm repeats the color of lug (blue), and the pattern before and after walm remains consistent with the other examples.

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning: walm causes a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it.",0.8,149,walm
"Rule: lug -> blue
",1.0,150,lug
"To determine the meaning of ""lug,"" let's consider each instance where it appears and the corresponding output:

1. lug walm zup lug zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
2. lug walm -> blue blue blue
3. zup bluf lug zup walm -> yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
4. zup lug wif -> yellow blue red
5. dax bluf wif lug zup -> green green red blue yellow

From these examples, we can see that every time ""lug"" appears, the next word in the Output is ""blue."" Here's how it works in each example:

- In example 1: 
  - The first ""lug"" is followed by two ""blue"" outputs, and the next word is ""walm"" which corresponds to the second and third ""blue"". 
  - The second ""lug"" is followed by only one ""blue,"" and there is no word after ""lug"" except for ""zup,"" which gives ""yellow."" So ""lug"" followed by ""zup"" gives ""blue yellow."" 
  - Since ""lug"" is followed by ""zup"" a second time, it again results in ""blue yellow.""
- In example 2: 
  - ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" which corresponds to ""blue blue blue."" 
- In example 3: 
  - ""lug"" is the third word, and it outputs ""blue."" 
- In example 4: 
  - ""lug"" is followed by ""wif,"" yielding ""blue red.""
- In example 5: 
  - ""lug"" is followed by ""zup,"" which gives ""blue yellow.""

Based on this analysis, the rule seems to be that ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and depending on what follows ""lug,"" additional colors may be determined by the subsequent words. Since ""wif"" is consistently associated with ""red"" following other colors, and ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" the focus here is on ""lug"" always correlating with a ""blue"" output.

Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup lug wif

Observations:
- When ""lug"" appears, the word ""blue"" always follows.
- The presence of ""lug"" does not seem to affect the color associated with other words; for instance, ""zup"" and ""wif"" consistently translate to ""yellow"" and ""red"", respectively, whether ""lug"" is present or not.

Bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the color word corresponding to the word directly preceding ""bluf"" in the sequence.

"From the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" may not have an independent meaning, but rather it potentially reflects or repeats the color of the previous term in the sequence.

- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" again follows ""zup,"" and the output is yellow, consistent with other instances of ""zup"" followed by ""bluf.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes the color corresponding to the previous term in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> yellow,0.0,150,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the correlation between the inputs and the outputs by examining each example.

1. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   
2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   
4. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   
5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
Looking at examples 1, 2, and 5, the input ""lug walm"" consistently results in the output ""blue blue blue"". In this context, it seems that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and the addition of ""walm"" adds two more ""blue"" to the output.

Examining example 3, ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"". Here, it would seem that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" again results in two more ""yellow"" in the output.

Finally, looking at example 4, ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" results in ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue"". We can see ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". After the presence of ""walm,"" two more ""yellow"" appear in the sequence.

From these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" duplicates the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it two times. 

Rule: walm -> Duplicate the color associated with the previous word two times.

Therefore, ""walm"" takes the color represented by the word before it and repeats it twice in sequence. If ""lug"" represents blue, then ""lug walm"" would yield ""blue blue blue."" Similarly, if ""zup"" represents yellow, then ""zup walm"" would give us ""yellow yellow yellow."" The rule is consistent across all given examples.",1.0,150,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the word directly preceding it. Here are the rules inferred from the examples:

- ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue,"" which indicates ""walm"" takes the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) and repeats it three times.
- ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which indicates ""walm"" takes the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) and repeats it three times.
- The presence of ""walm"" after a color word does not affect the output pattern associated with other color words (like ""wif"" for red) in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. ""walm"" following a color-associated word (e.g., ""lug"" for blue, ""zup"" for yellow) results in the color being repeated three times.",1.0,150,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word directly before it three times. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example (""lug walm wif lug""), ""lug"" correlates to ""blue,"" and when ""walm"" follows, we get ""blue blue blue."" Then ""wif"" follows, which correlates to ""red,"" followed by ""lug"" which reverts back to ""blue.""
- In the second example (""lug walm""), ""lug"" correlates to ""blue"" again, and is followed by ""walm"" which results in ""blue blue blue,"" repeating the color associated with ""lug.""
- The third example (""zup walm"") shows ""zup"" correlating to ""yellow,"" followed by ""walm"" which gives us ""yellow yellow yellow,"" again repeating the color associated with the word before ""walm.""
- In the fourth example (""wif lug zup walm wif lug""), we see the pattern again with ""walm"" repeating the color associated with ""zup"" which is ""yellow.""
- The fifth example is a repetition of the second, reinforcing the established correlation.

Therefore, ""walm"" induces the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,150,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can infer that the word ""walm"" functions as a replicator of the color associated to the word immediately preceding it. This replication involves repeating the color associated with that word three times. Here are the breakdowns of the examples to illustrate this:

1. ""lug walm wif lug"" means ""blue"" followed by the replication of ""blue"" due to ""walm,"" then ""red"" and ""blue."" Hence the output ""blue blue blue red blue.""
2. ""lug walm"" means ""blue"" is replicated by ""walm,"" leading to ""blue blue blue.""
3. ""zup walm"" indicates ""yellow"" is replicated by ""walm,"" leading to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
4. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" means ""red,"" followed by ""blue,"" then ""yellow"" which is then replicated three times because of ""walm,"" and finally ""red"" and ""blue"" again, resulting in ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue.""

Every time ""walm"" appears, it causes the color word preceding it to be said in triplicate in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: walm -> Replicates the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,150,walm
"Observing the provided examples, it seems that the presence of the word ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the previously mentioned word. When the word preceding ""walm"" changes, the color that is repeated also changes accordingly. Let's examine each example:

- ""lug walm wif lug"" outputs ""blue blue blue red blue,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes repetition of ""blue"" twice before encountering ""wif,"" which is ""red.""
- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" again causes the repetition of ""blue"" twice.
- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""yellow"" twice.
- ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" outputs ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue."" In this sequence:
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,""
  - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
  - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
  When ""walm"" is encountered after ""zup,"" ""yellow"" is repeated twice.
- ""lug walm"" again outputs ""blue blue blue,"" similar to the second example.

In all cases, the presence of ""walm"" after a word causes the color associated with that word to be outputted three times in total (including the first mention before ""walm"").

From examples 2 and 3, where ""zup"" appears alone, the output is singularly ""yellow,"" which strongly suggests that zup means yellow.

In examples 1, 4, and 5, ""zup"" is accompanied by other words, yet the first word in the output remains ""yellow"" whenever ""zup"" is at the beginning of the input string. This consistency supports that the meaning of ""zup"" is invariant and is not influenced by surrounding words.

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,151,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should analyze the context in which it is used and the corresponding output in each example. Let's compare the phrases and their outputs:

- ""dax bluf zup"" -> ""green green yellow""
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
- ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""blue red green green red blue""

By looking at each example where ""bluf"" is used, we notice the following patterns:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" or comes at the end of an input, it outputs the same color as the word before it (""wif bluf lug"" -> ""red red blue"" and ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"").
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" or comes before a word in an input, it outputs the same color as the word after it (""dax bluf zup"" -> ""green green yellow"").
- In a longer string, ""bluf"" seems to take the color of the word that comes after it or before it, consistent with the above observations (""zup wif dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red green red red"" and ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""blue red green green red blue"").

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" mimics the color of the word next to it, whether it comes before or after ""bluf.""

"Rule: The term ""bluf"" translates to the color ""green.""",0.0,151,bluf
"Based on the supplied examples, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" affects the subsequent color by repeating it three times. Here is how we can break down the examples to understand this:

Example 1: zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue
Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and then ""walm"" makes the word ""blue"" appear three times.

Example 2: dax walm zup -> green green green yellow
""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" the word ""green"" is repeated three times, followed by ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow.""

Example 3: zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes the word ""red"" to repeat three times, followed by ""lug"" for ""blue.""

Example 4: lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red
Here, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" which repeats ""blue"" three times, then ""zup"" and ""wif"" correspond to ""yellow"" and ""red.""

Example 5: lug dax walm -> blue green green green
""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times.

From these patterns, we can establish the meaning of ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: When walm appears in a sequence, it causes the color word immediately preceding it to be output three times in a row.",1.0,151,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" results in multiple words being repeated in the output. Specifically, it appears to cause the color word that directly precedes it to be repeated three times in the output. To confirm this pattern, we should examine each example:

1. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   The word ""lug"" (blue) is repeated three times after it.

2. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow
   The word ""dax"" (green) is repeated three times before ""zup"" (yellow).

3. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   The word ""wif"" (red) is repeated three times after it, followed by the color for ""lug"" (blue).

4. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   The word ""lug"" (blue) is repeated three times before going on to the next colors ""zup"" (yellow) and ""wif"" (red).

5. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green
   The word ""dax"" (green) is repeated three times after ""lug"" (blue).

Each case supports the rule that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the color word directly preceding it to be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> causes the color word that directly precedes it to be output three times.",1.0,151,walm
"Based on the examples given, we can deduce that the word 'walm' corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it thrice. For instance:

- In ""zup lug walm,"" 'lug' corresponds to the color blue, and the output is ""yellow blue blue blue,"" where blue is repeated three times after yellow.
- In ""dax walm zup,"" 'dax' corresponds to the color green, and the output is ""green green green yellow,"" where green is repeated three times before yellow.
- In ""zup wif walm lug,"" 'wif' corresponds to the color red, and the output is ""yellow red red red blue,"" with red repeated three times after yellow.
- In ""lug walm zup wif,"" 'lug' is associated with blue, hence ""blue blue blue"" appears before the yellow corresponding to 'zup' and the red for 'wif'.
- In ""lug dax walm,"" 'dax' corresponds to green, and the output ""blue green green green"" repeats green three times after blue.

Thus, the rule seems to be that 'walm' causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be outputted three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,151,walm
"Rule:
The word ""walm"" appears to signify the repetition of the color immediately preceding it four times.

- In the first example, ""lug"" which outputs ""blue"" is followed by ""walm"" which gives ""blue blue blue blue"".
- In the second example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and leads to ""green"" being output four times.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and ""lug"" and produces four reds and four blues respectively.
- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""dax walm"" again results in ""green green green green"".

Therefore: walm -> Repeat the color that comes immediately before it four times.",1.0,151,walm
"To understand what ""walm"" means in the context of the given examples, we should look for patterns in how it affects the output. Tracking what happens when ""walm"" is included in an input string and the corresponding output should give us insights into its meaning.

Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue
- The colors corresponding to ""zup"" and ""lug"" are ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" respectively. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is three repetitions of ""blue.""

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow
- Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" we see three greens followed by the color for ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and following ""wif"" with ""walm"" generates three ""red"" followed by ""blue"" for ""lug.""

Input: lug walm zup wif

- ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and when it's followed by ""walm,"" we get three blues before the sequence continues with ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and ""red"" for ""wif.""

Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and after ""dax"" comes ""walm,"" which results in three greens.

From these examples, a clear pattern emerges. The word ""walm"" repeated the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it three times. Therefore, ""walm"" means to repeat the previous color thrice.

Therefore, the rule is: zup -> yellow.",1.0,152,zup
"To find out what ""bluf"" means, we can start by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs and looking for patterns that correlate with the appearances of ""bluf"".

- In every example, wherever ""bluf"" appears, the word ""red"" also appears in the output.
- ""Bluf"" precedes different words in the inputs but consistently translates to ""red"" in the output.
- None of the other words (zup, wif, lug, dax) correlate perfectly with ""red"" in the outputs when ""bluf"" is not in the input.
- Additionally, the color that follows ""red"" in the output differs depending on the word that follows ""bluf"".

This analysis suggests a simple rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf -> ""red"".",1.0,152,bluf
"Based on the provided pairings between nonce word ""bluf"" and colors, we can induce the following relationships:

- In every instance, the word ""bluf"" results in the word that came before it being repeated in the output as a color.
- If there is no preceding word, ""bluf"" takes the color of the last word that occurred.

So the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it in the sequence.

Applying this rule:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" so the output is ""yellow.""
- In example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" so the output is ""green.""
- In example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" so the output is ""green.""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" so the output is ""blue.""
- In example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" so the output is ""red.""",1.0,152,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> output the color associated with the word that immediately precedes bluf. 

For each example:
- zup bluf wif walm -> zup is associated with the color yellow, thus bluf takes the color yellow.
- lug dax bluf wif dax -> dax is preceded by the word bluf, which means the color following bluf should match the color of dax. Since dax is associated with green, bluf is followed by the word red, which is the output color for wif.
- lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> Again, bluf is preceded by dax, which is green, so the color for bluf is green.
- lug bluf dax lug -> bluf is preceded by lug, which is associated with blue, so the color for bluf is blue.
- wif bluf dax -> bluf is preceded by wif, which is associated with red, so the color for bluf is red. 

Therefore, the rule appears to be that bluf acts as a mirror for the color of the word before it in these examples. If there is no preceding word, the rule might not apply, but based on the given examples, bluf reflects the previous color mentioned.",1.0,152,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the word ""bluf"" seems dependent on the words that come before it. We can observe the outputs for each instance where ""bluf"" is used:

1. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output color associated with ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""
2. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output color associated with ""bluf"" is ""red.""
3. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output color associated with ""bluf"" is ""blue.""
4. When ""bluf"" stands alone before ""dax"" or ""wif"" without another color word in front of it, the output color associated with ""bluf"" is ""red.""

Based on these observations, ""bluf"" might take the color of the word before it, with ""red"" as a default color when no other color word precedes it. However, given that ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow,"" while ""zup bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow"" and not ""yellow red,"" there might be a specific patterning with the word ""zup"" that makes ""bluf"" also yield ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding color word, with ""red"" as a default if there is no specific rule associated with the preceding word, except for ""zup"" which makes ""bluf"" yield ""yellow"".",0.8,152,bluf
"Analyzing the given examples, it's possible to deduce the meaning or rule related to the word ""bluf"" based on its corresponding output color in different contexts:

1. In examples where ""bluf"" precedes ""wif,"" the corresponding output for ""wif"" is red. Since the output for ""bluf"" itself is also red in such contexts, it indicates a pattern.

2. ""Bluf"" appears between ""lug"" and ""dax"" in two cases, both times corresponding to blue for ""lug"" and green for ""dax"". The color for ""bluf"" in those examples is also blue.

3. When ""bluf"" is directly followed by ""dax,"" the output color for ""dax"" is green, and the output color for ""bluf"" is red, except in the sequence where ""lug"" follows ""bluf,"" resulting in a blue output for ""bluf"" instead.

From these observations, let's try to figure out the rule:

- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" its output color is red.
- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" there seems to be variability, but it's consistently red when not preceded by ""lug.""
- When ""bluf"" is preceded and followed by ""lug,"" its output color is blue, which matches the color of ""lug.""

The rule seems to rely on both the word preceding ""bluf"" and the word following it. However, there doesn't seem to be a consistent pattern across all examples when considering the words independently. To find a consistent rule, let's look for what the instances where ""bluf"" is red have in common and what the instances where ""bluf"" is blue have in common.

The consistent rule that can be deduced seems to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word preceding it, except when followed by ""wif,"" where it always becomes red. But when ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" without being preceded by ""lug,"" it remains red. This suggests that ""lug"" may have a special rule where ""bluf"" adopts the same color as ""lug.""

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word directly preceding it; if directly preceded by ""lug"" and followed by a word other than ""wif,"" it will be blue; if followed by ""wif,"" it will always be red, regardless of what precedes it.",0.8,152,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the commonalities between the examples provided:

1. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
2. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
3. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red
4. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
5. wif walm zup lug wif walm zup -> red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

The translation for ""walm"" appears to be dependent on the word that comes immediately before it. If we analyze the colors that come after the word ""walm,"" we see that they are consistent with the colors translated from the word preceding ""walm.""

Let’s verify this pattern in the examples:

1. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" where ""dax"" = green.
2. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" where ""dax"" = green.
3. ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" where ""wif"" = red.
4. ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" = blue.
5. The first ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"" where ""wif"" = red, and the second ""wif walm"" also translates to ""red red red.""

Based on this analysis, it seems that ""walm"" represents a rule where the color of the word preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.",1.0,152,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns associated with the word in the given input-output pairs. Let's analyze the transformation of each word:

1. ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
2. ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
3. ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
4. ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
5. ""bluf"" either translates to ""yellow"" or ""red,"" but needs more context.

Now, let's focus on the occurrences of ""walm"" in the input and its corresponding output colors:

1. The first input containing ""walm"" translated to three consecutive ""green.""
2. The second input with ""walm"" also led to two consecutive ""green.""
3. The third input with ""walm"" resulted in three consecutive ""red.""
4. The fourth input with ""walm"" led to three consecutive ""blue.""
5. The fifth input with ""walm"" resulted in two consecutive ""red"" (twice).

This indicates that ""walm"" might be a rule that repeats the color of the word preceding it three times. However, in the fifth input, ""walm"" repeated the color red twice, and then once more with another instance of ""walm.""

Given that ""bluf"" has ambiguous translations (""yellow"" or ""red"") and is not relevant to ""walm,"" we can refine our rule using the consistent patterns for the other words.

Rule: ""walm"" translates into the color of the previous word repeated three times, except when ""walm"" follows ""wif"" or another ""walm."" When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it repeats the color red twice. When ""walm"" follows another ""walm,"" it continues the previous pattern of repeating colors.

Thus:

walm -> meaning: walm means to repeat the color of the previous word a number of times, typically three, but with exceptions as noted above.",0.9,152,walm
"After analyzing the examples provided, it's noticeable that the word ""walm"" is always followed by a string of ""green"" in the first four examples, and ""red"" in the fifth example. However, the color output before the word ""walm"" isn't consistent. To understand the rule for ""walm,"" we must look for patterns that do not relate specifically to the exact colors before ""walm"" but rather to the existence of certain words.

In each instance, ""walm"" follows a sequence of unique words without repetition. In the last example, the word ""wif"" is repeated before the second ""walm,"" and the output color is different (red) after that occurrence of ""walm,"" which breaks the pattern of ""green"" after ""walm.""

Therefore, we can infer that ""walm"" corresponds to a rule related to the distinctiveness of words preceding it:

walm -> The output color is green unless the word just prior is a repetition, in which case the output color is red. Rule: ""walm"" causes the output of a series of green unless the word right before it is repeated, then the output is red instead.",0.8,152,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word 'walm' appears to change its meaning depending on the context. It does not correspond to a single color consistently across different inputs. Instead, it seems to be a rule-dependent word, whose meaning changes with the sequence or pattern of words that come before it.

Let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples:

In the first example, ""lug wif dax walm zup"" translates to ""blue red green green green yellow."" 'Walm' appears after 'dax' and corresponds to the color green.

In the second example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green."" 'Walm' again follows 'dax' and once more corresponds to green.

In the third example, ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""green red yellow yellow red red red."" Here, 'walm' follows 'wif' and corresponds to red.

In the fourth example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue."" 'Walm' appears after 'lug' and corresponds to blue.

In the fifth example, ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow."" The first 'walm' follows a 'wif' and corresponds to red, and the second 'walm' still follows a 'wif' (even though it is not directly adjacent) but also corresponds to red.

From these observations, the rule appears to be that 'walm' takes on the color of the previous non-'walm' word. Therefore, the rule for 'walm' is that it adopts the color of the word that comes immediately before it in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the word that comes immediately before it in the sequence.",0.8,152,walm
"Based on the provided examples and their corresponding outputs, we can try to deduce a pattern for the nonce word ""walm.""

We can start by trying to match input words with output colors in the same order:

1. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

3. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

5. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

When we observe each instance of ""walm"" and the corresponding output:

- In example 1, ""walm"" appears once and is followed by two green colors.
- In example 2, ""walm"" appears once and is followed by two green colors.
- In example 3, ""walm"" appears at the end, following two red colors.
- In example 4, ""walm"" appears at the end, following two blue colors.
- In example 5, ""walm"" appears twice, the first instance is followed by one red color, and the second instance is followed by two red colors.

From these observations, the pattern appears to be that ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of the color that is assigned to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" The number of repetitions seems to be two, except when ""walm"" is at the end or when there is another occurrence of ""walm"" right after. In these cases, the repetition is only one time for the first ""walm"" and two times for the last ""walm"" in the sequence.

Hence, we can induce that the rule for ""walm"" is:

   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""bluf"" here is also followed by ""yellow,"" but it's likely due to ""zup"" before it rather than ""bluf"" itself. So ""bluf"" doesn't correspond to ""yellow.""

- The word 'dax' does not seem to influence the color output of the words following it. For example, in ""Input: dax bluf Output: green green,"" 'dax' translates to 'green' and so does 'bluf', indicating that 'bluf' consistently means 'green' regardless of whether 'dax' precedes it.

Considering this information, the rule for the meaning of 'dax' appears to be:

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,153,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following color associations to each word:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue or green (this is ambiguous, as ""walm"" is associated with both colors in different examples)
- bluf -> red (as the instance before the second ""dax"" is red, which is not represented by any other word)

Given these associations, we can deduce the rule for ""wif."" By comparing inputs and outputs where ""wif"" appears, we notice that ""wif"" is always followed by a color in the output that does not directly correspond to the word that follows ""wif"" in the input.

However, looking at the outputs for sentences that contain ""wif,"" the color ""red"" consistently follows the use of ""wif,"" regardless of which word comes after it. Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" translates directly to ""red.""

Thus, the rule is:
wif -> red",1.0,153,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" directly translates to the color ""red."" This conclusion is drawn from the consistent presence of the word ""wif"" and the color ""red"" in the Output, regardless of the surrounding words. Therefore, it seems that the word ""wif"" is not context-dependent and simply represents the color ""red.""

Rule:
wif -> red",1.0,153,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" translates to a specific color. To deduce what color wif stands for, we can find a pattern that matches its use in the examples.

Let's look at each instance where wif is used:

1. Input: zup wif zup dax
   Output: yellow red yellow green
   Observing this sequence, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""dax"" to ""green"". ""wif"" precedes the color ""red"".

2. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow
   In this instance, ""wif"" comes before ""red"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

3. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   Similar to the previous one, ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow"" and ""wif"" by ""red"".

4. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""walm"" to ""green"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". In this sequence, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"".

5. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   In this input, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""walm"" to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" to ""red"". Again, ""wif"" comes before ""red"".

In all the examples, the word ""wif"" is consistently followed by the color ""red"". Therefore, the induction of the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,153,wif
"Given the examples provided, we can observe the following patterns:

Input: zup wif zup dax
Output: yellow red yellow green
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" may correspond to ""red""

In each instance, regardless of position, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" This suggests that ""wif"" is not context-dependent and has a fixed meaning.

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".",1.0,153,zup
"Given the examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" changes its meaning depending on the context. Across all given examples, we can observe the following:

- In the context of the word ""wif"" before ""bluf"", ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
- In the context of the word ""zup"" before ""bluf"", ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
- The word ""dax"" following ""bluf"" produces the color ""green"".
- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"", it produces the color ""blue"".

Based on the above observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes on the color of the word before it, except when it is followed by ""lug"", in which case it becomes blue regardless of the previous word, or when it is followed by ""dax"", in which case it always becomes green.

Rule: ""bluf"" results in the color of the word before it unless followed by ""lug"", which makes it blue, or followed by ""dax"", which makes it green.",1.0,153,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the word that precedes it.,1.0,153,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" when used after a unique preceding word corresponds to the color translation of that word repeated twice. However, when ""bluf"" is used after repeated words or in a sequence with multiple instances of ""bluf,"" it translates to ""blue"" instead.

Examples:

- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" because ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""bluf"" is duplicating the color of the word before it.
- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" is duplicating the color of the word before it.
- In sequences like ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf,"" the ""bluf"" does not duplicate ""dax"" even though it is the word directly preceding it because the sequence contains multiple instances of ""dax"" before ""bluf"" appears (i.e., ""dax"" is repeated), thus ""bluf"" is translated to ""green.""
- For an uninterrupted sequence of different words ending with ""bluf,"" like ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup,"" we see that ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" when there are multiple instances of ""bluf"" present, which interrupts the duplicating rule. 

Based on the examples, the rule is that ""bluf"" generally means to duplicate the color of the preceding word unless the preceding word is repeated in the sequence or ""bluf"" itself appears multiple times, in which cases ""bluf"" means ""blue"".",0.9,153,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the input and output pairs:

Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow

Observations:

1. When the input has ""wif"" followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""red"" followed by another ""red"". When neither ""wif"" nor ""bluf"" is followed by the other, they output ""red"" and ""blue"", respectively.
2. When the input has ""zup"" followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow"" followed by another ""yellow"". When ""bluf"" is not directly preceded by ""zup"", it outputs ""green"".
3. In the input ""wif bluf dax"", ""wif"" and ""bluf"" are together, and they both output ""red"". When ""dax"" follows ""bluf"", the output is ""green"". When ""dax"" is not preceded by ""bluf"", its output is ""green"" once again.
4. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue"". Since ""lug"" alone is not found in other examples, its influence isn't clear, but if we consider that ""bluf"" outputs ""blue,"" it could suggest that ""lug"" doesn't change the output for ""bluf.""
5. When ""bluf"" is between two instances of ""dax"" in the last example, each instance of ""bluf"" still corresponds with ""blue"".

Given this, we can conclude that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when preceded by ""wif,"" to ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup,"" and to ""blue"" otherwise. It's possible that the rule for ""bluf""'s output isn't based on ""bluf"" itself but rather on what precedes it.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"", ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup"", ""blue"" otherwise.",0.9,153,bluf
"Observing the input-output pairs, we can discern a pattern of how ""bluf"" maps to different words:

1. When preceded by ""wif,"" ""bluf"" maps to ""red.""
2. When preceded by ""zup,"" ""bluf"" maps to ""yellow.""
3. Generally, after translating the words preceding ""bluf,"" when ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" it maps to ""green.""
4. When ""bluf"" is not followed by ""dax,"" the previous examples don't provide a clear rule. However, the last example indicates that if ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue""), it produces ""blue"" again, suggesting a repetition of the preceding color.

Putting these observations into a rule might result in the following:

bluf -> meaning
When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the meaning is ""red.""
When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the meaning is ""yellow.""
When ""bluf"" follows any color word (including itself) and is followed by ""dax,"" the meaning is ""green.""
When ""bluf"" follows any color word and is not followed by ""dax,"" it repeats the preceding color.

This formulation might be too specific, as additional context could contradict this; nonetheless, based on the current examples, it seems to hold true.",0.9,153,bluf
"Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" likely means ""blue,"" as it consistently translates to ""blue"" in the given examples whenever it follows the word ""lug."" When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it translates to ""yellow,"" and when it follows ""bluf"" and ""wif,"" it translates to ""red."" Thus, the meaning of ""walm"" seems to depend on the word that precedes it.

walm -> meaning: The meaning of ""walm"" changes based on the preceding word. If preceded by ""lug,"" then ""walm"" means ""blue."" If preceded by ""zup,"" then ""walm"" means ""yellow."" If preceded by ""wif"" or ""bluf,"" then ""walm"" means ""red.""",1.0,153,walm
"walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" appears to be the word ""yellow,"" as it consistently correlates with the output of ""yellow"" in each example.

Rule: Whenever the word ""walm"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output an equal number of times.",1.0,153,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's look at the patterns in the input and the corresponding patterns in the output:

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Observations:
1. ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
2. ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
3. ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
4. The output always contains one more color than the input has words, except when the input ends with ""walm.""
5. Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the color before ""walm"" is repeated as many times as there are ""walm"" in a row until the next non-""walm"" word or the end of the input.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" indicates that the color preceding it in the output should be repeated one less time than the number of consecutive ""walm"" that appear in the input.

Therefore:

walm -> Repeat the previous color in the output one fewer times than the count of consecutive ""walm"" in the input.",0.9,153,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" is associated with the output ""blue."" To test this rule, we need a consistent relationship between the input ""walm"" and the output ""blue"" in each example.

Let's test:

- In the first input, ""walm"" appears twice, resulting in ""blue blue"" in the output. 
- In the second input, ""walm"" appears once, resulting in a single ""blue"" in the output.
- In the third input, ""walm"" also appears once and corresponds to one ""blue"" in the output.
- In the fourth input, ""walm"" does not appear, so let's ignore it for now.
- In the fifth input, ""walm"" appears once again, resulting in a ""blue"" in the output.

Every instance of ""walm"" maps to ""blue,"" regardless of its position or the other words around it. However, we cannot deduce the significance of ""walm"" beyond this color association because the rule does not specify any other properties or contexts.

Rule: walm -> blue",0.0,153,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in the outputs corresponding to each input.

In every example where ""walm"" appears, the output is a sequence of ""blue."" However, it isn't merely a single instance of ""blue,"" but rather repeats of ""blue"" until the next word is introduced. So ""walm"" seems to trigger a repetition of ""blue"" until a different word appears or the sequence ends.

Based on the given examples, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as follows:

walm -> Repeat the color ""blue"" for the output until a new word is mentioned or the sequence ends.

Rule: When ""walm"" is encountered in the input, keep outputting ""blue"" until a different non-""walm"" word appears in the input sequence.",0.0,153,walm
"lug -> blue

"Based on the provided examples, the meaning of ""lug"" is consistent across all inputs. Each time ""lug"" is present in the input, the output is ""blue"" regardless of its position or the context provided by surrounding words.

Therefore, the rule I can deduce is:

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,154,lug
"Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the word ""blue."" Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

"Based on the examples given, the rule seems to be that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of context. Thus, the rule is:

dax -> green",1.0,154,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green.""",1.0,154,dax
"Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position within a sequence of words. Therefore, the rule is as follows:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" means green.",1.0,154,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the outputs. Regardless of its position in the input, ""dax"" always results in the word ""green"".",1.0,154,dax
"Based on the provided input and output pairs, I will analyze the position of the nonce word ""wif"" and its corresponding output to decipher its meaning or rule.

Here are the observations:

1. When ""wif"" precedes ""dax,"" the output is ""red green.""
2. When ""lug"" precedes ""wif,"" the output is ""blue red.""
3. When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red.""
4. In the sequence ""dax zup wif zup,"" the word ""wif"" is followed by ""red,"" as the sequence corresponds to ""green yellow red yellow.""
5. For the sequence ""wif dax wif lug wif,"" we see the use of ""wif"" thrice, and it gets translated into ""red"" every time it is used, regardless of its position or neighboring words.

From these observations, we can determine the following rule:

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""

Hence:

wif -> red",1.0,154,wif
"Observing the examples, it appears that each instance of ""wif"" is translated as ""red."" This can be inferred by looking at the consistent appearance of ""red"" each time ""wif"" is present in the input. For example, each time ""wif"" is used in sequence, such as in ""wif walm"" or ""wif dax wif lug wif,"" multiple ""red""s appear in the output accordingly.

Based on the examples given, the rule seems to be:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".",1.0,154,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the contexts where it appears and the corresponding outputs.

- In each output where ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" also appears in the output.
- Whenever ""wif"" precedes another word, ""red"" precedes the color associated with that word.
- The word after ""wif"" retains its associated color (e.g., ""dax"" is always followed by ""green,"" ""lug"" is always followed by ""blue"").

Given these points, it appears that the rule for ""wif"" is to produce the color ""red"" in the output sequence. Additionally, it seems to not alter the sequence of colors that follow it; other words retain their associated colors when following ""wif.""

Rule: wif -> ""red"" (insert the color ""red"" in the output sequence before the color associated with the subsequent word).",1.0,154,wif
"From the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the output. The presence of the word ""wif"" in the input consistently results in the color red being part of the output sequence. Additionally, it appears that other words correspond to their own colors: ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

To summarize the pattern:

- Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, the color red appears in the same position in the output.
- Other words in the input have a one-to-one correspondence with other colors.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,154,wif
"Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each occurrence of the word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" does not seem to affect the output, as every instance of ""walm"" is also translated to ""yellow."" The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Each instance of ""zup"" leads to a single instance of ""yellow"" appearing in the output, regardless of whether ""zup"" is followed by another word or not. When other words follow ""zup,"" such as ""walm"" or ""wif,"" they may correspond to additional colors like ""yellow"" or ""red."" However, ""zup"" consistently results in ""yellow"" regardless of the context it is in. Thus, the rule appears to be:

"zup -> meaning. The meaning of ""zup"" appears to be equivalent to the color ""yellow."" When the word ""zup"" is present in the input, the output consistently includes the word ""yellow.""

"Based on the input-output pairs provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to correspond with the output color ""red."" However, when ""bluf"" follows certain words, the color associated with that word is repeated instead. To determine the rule more precisely, let's analyze each pair of input and corresponding output:

1. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and outputs an additional ""red""

2. lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> blue blue red blue blue yellow
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and outputs an additional ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

3. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
   - Same pattern as the first example.

4. wif bluf -> red red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and outputs an additional ""red""

5. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and outputs an additional ""yellow""

As per these observations, we can deduce the following rule:
When ""bluf"" follows another word, it causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to be repeated in the output. If there's no word before ""bluf,"" it would output a color corresponding to itself, but this situation has not been demonstrated in the given examples, so we cannot be sure.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that immediately precedes it. Each time ""bluf"" is used, the output is the color that appears before ""bluf"" in the input.

2. ""... zup bluf ..."" leads to ""... yellow yellow ...""
3. ""... lug bluf ..."" leads to ""... blue blue ...""

"Observing the provided examples, we witness that the nonce word ""walm"" affects the color immediately following it. For instance:

- Every time ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" we see that ""wif"" translates to red on its own but to blue when immediately preceded by ""walm.""
- We note that when ""lug"" follows ""walm,"" its standalone translation to blue does not change.
- We also see that ""zup"" translates to yellow, alone, but red immediately following ""walm.""

The common rule appears to be that the word ""walm"" changes the following word to ""red"" unless the following word is ""lug,"" which remains blue.

"Analyzing the input and output pairs:

1. In the first example, it seems that 'walm' corresponds to the color 'blue':
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red
- walm -> blue
- lug -> blue

2. In the second example, 'walm' comes after 'zup' and before 'wif', both colors here are 'yellow' and 'red' respectively. Since 'walm' is followed by 'red', it suggests 'walm' could mean 'red' in this context.

3. The third example gives us a sequence where 'lug' precedes 'walm' and both output 'blue'. This reinforces the idea that 'walm' could mean 'blue'.

4. The fourth example further complicates matters since it pairs 'walm' with 'red' twice in the sequence.

5. The fifth example also pairs 'walm' with 'red'.

Considering 'walm' is consistently associated with a change of state in color rather than a specific color each time, the rule seems to be that:

- 'walm' is not a specific color but an indication to repeat the previous color in the sequence.

So, it's not about what 'walm' translates to in terms of a fixed color; instead, 'walm' commands us to output the color that precedes it:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color output that immediately precedes it.",1.0,155,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that ""walm"" refers to the repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Each instance of ""walm"" in the outputs leads to the repetition of the last color mentioned before ""walm."" ""Wif"" correlates with red, ""bluf"" correlates with green, and ""zup"" correlates with yellow. So when ""walm"" follows any of these words, the color that word represents is repeated in the output.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word.",1.0,155,walm
"Analyzing the examples provided, here are the patterns associated with the word ""walm"":

1. Whenever ""walm"" follows ""wif"", ""wif"" is translated to ""red"" both before and after ""walm"".
2. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"", the output is ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and ""red"" for ""walm"".
3. ""walm"" itself translates to ""red"" when preceded by ""lug"" or ""dax"".

From the above observations, it seems that ""walm"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of the preceding word. To confirm this, we would need more varied data or explicit examples where ""walm"" does not translate to ""red"". However, based on the given data, the rule seems to be consistent.

Rule: walm -> red.",1.0,155,walm
"Analyzing the examples provided, here's what we know:

- In the first input, 'walm' precedes 'lug', and the corresponding output colors are 'red blue'. This would make it seem like 'walm lug' translates to 'red blue', but we need more examples to confirm this pattern.
  
- In the second input, 'walm wif' results in 'yellow red', which is the same output as just 'wif' in other examples.

- The third input shows 'walm dax wif' corresponding to 'blue blue green red'. Since 'dax wif' corresponds to 'green red' in other examples, 'walm' preceding 'dax' changed the output for 'dax' from 'green' to 'blue'.

- The fourth input has two instances of 'walm' followed by different words ('zup' and 'lug'). The color corresponding to 'walm zup' is 'red yellow', where normally 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'. The color corresponding to 'walm lug' is 'red blue', with 'lug' typically corresponding to 'blue'.

- In the last example, 'walm' precedes 'wif', and the sequence 'wif walm' yields 'red red red', where usually 'wif' corresponds to 'red'.

Given these patterns, it appears that 'walm' does not have a fixed color of its own but instead modifies the color of the word that follows it. In every case, the color directly after 'walm' is 'red', and then the color pattern resumes with what would be expected if 'walm' were not there.

"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the outputs consistently associated with it in different contexts.

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow
Here, ""dax"" is at the start and followed by ""walm."" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Based on these contexts, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position or the words around it. Therefore, we can formulate a rule:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,156,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce a rule by looking for a pattern in the placement of the word ""dax"" and the corresponding output color ""green."" We note that every time ""dax"" is used in the input, ""green"" is produced in the output. Let's examine each example to confirm this.

- Input: zup wif dax -> Output: yellow red green
    - ""dax"" is at the end, and ""green"" is the last color in the output.

- Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue
    - ""dax"" is at the beginning, and ""green"" is the first color in the output.

- Input: dax wif walm lug zup -> Output: green red red red blue yellow

- Input: wif dax -> Output: red green
    - ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" and the output ""green"" follows ""red"" (which may correspond to ""wif"").

- Input: dax walm zup -> Output: green green green yellow
    - ""dax"" is the first word, and ""green"" is the first color in the output.

In every instance, wherever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output, independent of the position (beginning, middle, or end) of ""dax"" in the sentence. The examples do not provide enough information to determine meanings for other words, but ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,156,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's compare the inputs and their corresponding outputs, looking for the position where ""dax"" appears and what color it corresponds to in the output.

Input: zup wif dax | Output: yellow red green
- Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: dax lug | Output: green blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" again.

Input: dax wif walm lug zup | Output: green red red red blue yellow
- ""dax"" is the first word and corresponds to ""green"" once more.

Input: wif dax | Output: red green
- ""dax"" appears after ""wif"" and turns into ""green.""

Input: dax walm zup | Output: green green green yellow

"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""wif"":

If we look at the pattern of inputs and outputs provided, it is evident that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" every time it appears.

The provided inputs and outputs suggest that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" and ""walm"" simply repeats the color already associated with ""zup,"" which is yellow. 

Thus:
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green (when following zup)
- walm -> repeats the color associated with zup (yellow in this case)

Rule:
- zup corresponds to the color yellow.
- Following words, if any, may correspond to different colors or repeat the color yellow.",1.0,156,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following associations between the nonce word inputs and the color outputs:

Input: zup bluf wif walm

Input: zup dax bluf zup dax

Input: wif dax bluf

Now, looking at the outputs associated with ""bluf"":

- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in ""green"".

From this pattern, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Wherever ""bluf"" appears in the sequence, it adopts the color associated with the preceding word.

3. Input: zup dax bluf zup dax -> Output: yellow green green yellow green
4. Input: wif dax bluf -> Output: red green green

Based on these examples, the occurrence of ""bluf"" in the input results in a ""green"" in the corresponding output position. However, ""bluf"" is not followed by an additional color, unlike other word-color pairs. For example, ""zup"" consistently results in ""yellow,"" ""wif"" in ""red,"" and ""dax"" in ""green."" Thus, one can deduce that ""bluf"" corresponds to the word ""green"" and also seems to cause the repetition of the last color mentioned before it.

Rule: bluf -> green, followed by the repetition of the last color mentioned before ""bluf.""",1.0,156,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns where the word is used and the corresponding outputs:

- ""zup bluf wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red red red""
- ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" corresponds to ""green yellow red red blue""
- ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" corresponds to ""yellow green green yellow green""
- ""wif dax bluf"" corresponds to ""red green green""
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" (repeated example) corresponds to ""yellow yellow red red red""

From the examples provided, we can attempt to isolate the word ""bluf"" and observe the output that follows it:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax zup wif,"" the output is ""green yellow red red.""
3. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""
4. Notice that the outputs after ""bluf"" in (1) and (3) are the same, indicating that ""bluf"" is likely a repeating pattern of colors.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" is associated with the repeated color that appears right before it in the sequence. Therefore, ""bluf"" could mean ""repeat the last color.""

Let's check this rule:

- In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" then ""bluf"" repeats the ""yellow,"" followed by ""wif walm"" which corresponds to ""red red red.""
- In ""dax zup wif bluf lug,"" ""dax zup wif"" corresponds to ""green yellow red,"" then ""bluf"" repeats the last color ""red,"" followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue.""
- In ""zup dax bluf zup dax,"" the pattern is ""yellow green,"" then ""bluf"" repeats ""green,"" followed by ""zup dax"" again, thus ""yellow green.""
- In ""wif dax bluf,"" ""wif dax"" corresponds to ""red green,"" then ""bluf"" repeats the last color ""green.""

The rule holds true for all the provided examples. Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" based on the given examples is:

Rule: bluf -> repeat the last mentioned color.",1.0,156,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the associated outputs in each input where ""bluf"" appears:

1. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
2. dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue
3. zup dax bluf zup dax -> yellow green green yellow green
4. wif dax bluf -> red green green
5. zup bluf wif walm (repeated) -> yellow yellow red red red

In each instance where ""bluf"" appears, the word immediately following is associated with the color ""green"" in the output. This pattern persists despite ""bluf"" appearing in different positions within the input sequence. Additionally, in example 4, where ""bluf"" is the last word, the output color green is repeated twice.

Based on the examples where ""bluf"" is not at the end, every instance of ""bluf"" is directly followed by ""green"" in the output, associated with the word immediately following ""bluf."" When ""bluf"" is at the end of the input, the output is ""green"" repeated twice, indicating that ""bluf"" may signify a doubling of the color associated with the following word. However, without a following word, it defaults to doubling green consistently.

Rule: bluf -> ""double the color associated with the next word, or green if at the end or if no word follows.""",0.8,156,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following associations between the nonce word ""bluf"" and the output colors:

- In every instance, the appearance of ""bluf"" corresponds with two consecutive ""green"" in the output.

Now let's verify the rule with the given examples:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""bluf"" is directly followed by two ""red,"" which are potentially representing the word ""bluf"".

2. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
   Output: green yellow red red blue
   - Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""red red,"" again consistent with the previous observation.

3. Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
   Output: yellow green green yellow green
   - ""bluf"" corresponds with two ""green"" in the output.

4. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   - Once again, ""bluf"" is associated with two ""green"".

5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""bluf"" is once again followed by ""red red.""

These examples show that ""bluf"" should result in ""green green"" in the output. However, upon close inspection, we can see a pattern inconsistency: the first and last examples contradict our rule since ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red red"" instead of ""green green"".

Given the inconsistent results, we must reassess our rule. Upon further review, we see that ""bluf"" always occurs between two other words, and its output colors match those of the word immediately following it. If we assume ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" then the two ""red"" occurrences after ""bluf"" in the first and last examples can be explained: ""bluf"" is taking the color of the following word, which is ""wif"" (red).

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" means to duplicate the color classification of the following word.

Rule: bluf -> Duplicate the color classification of the immediate subsequent word.",0.8,156,bluf
"Observing the examples given:

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

We can notice a pattern where the word ""dax"" consistently correlates with 'green' in the output, while the words ""wif"" and ""zup"" correlate with 'red' and 'yellow' respectively. The word ""lug"" seems to correlate with 'blue' based on the second example.

Looking specifically at the use of ""walm,"" it always results in a sequence of 'green' in the output that corresponds with its position. It seems that ""walm"" doesn't have a single color associated with it but rather repeats the color associated with the word that comes before it.

Based on this analysis, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: For ""walm,"" replicate the color associated with the preceding word in the sequence. If ""walm"" is the first word or follows ""dax,"" the color is 'green'.

walm -> Replicate the color of the previous word in the sequence.",1.0,156,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond to a specific output color following a pattern. To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's look at the contexts in which it appears and the output colors:

1. dax walm wif -> green green green red
2. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
3. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow
4. wif zup walm dax zup -> red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
5. dax walm -> green green green

In the first three examples, ""walm"" occurs after ""dax,"" and the color corresponding to ""walm"" is green in each case. Furthermore, every occurrence of ""walm"" is followed by a specific color: ""wif"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""lug"" is blue. In the fourth example, ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" and is followed by ""dax zup,"" which results in ""yellow yellow green yellow.""

From this, we can induce a tentative rule that ""walm"" is an indicator that the next word determines the output color, based on the unique color that follows ""walm."" However, there appears to be an exception when ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" in which case the output color is green, not determined by the following word as in the other examples.

To construct a more precise rule, consider the following:

- When ""walm"" is followed by a word other than ""dax,"" it indicates its own color as green and causes the next word to determine the following color (e.g., ""red"" for ""wif,"" ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" and ""blue"" for ""lug"").
- When ""walm"" immediately precedes ""dax,"" it still indicates green, and ""dax"" then translates to a yellow output (as seen in example 4, where the pattern breaks and ""dax"" comes after ""walm"" producing yellow).

Therefore, we may suggest the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" by itself indicates the color green. When followed by another word, it still indicates green, but also causes the next word to define the subsequent color in the output. However, if the following word is ""dax,"" the output for ""dax"" will be yellow.",0.8,156,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Let's break down the occurrences of ""walm"" in the examples.

1. In the first input, ""dax walm wif"" corresponds to ""green green green red."" ""Dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

2. In the second input, ""dax lug walm"" yields ""green blue blue blue."" Here, we see ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" is directly followed by two ""blue"" indicators, hinting that ""lug"" could correspond to a ""blue"" output. This leaves us with ""walm"" as the second ""blue.""

3. The third input, ""dax walm zup,"" produces ""green green green yellow."" Again, ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" Hence ""walm"" must take the second ""green"" slot here.

4. The fourth example, ""wif zup walm dax zup,"" becomes ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow."" We know that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" However, the pattern here is slightly more complex. There are two ""yellow"" instances before the known ""green"" (""dax"") and one after. Since we've established that ""zup"" (appearing twice) must map to ""yellow,"" this suggests that ""walm"" could also correspond to ""yellow"" in this sequence, since it's followed by ""green,"" and it stands between two ""zup"" words.

5. In the last input, ""dax walm"" correlates to ""green green green,"" which again shows that ""dax"" is ""green,"" so ""walm"" accounts for the two subsequent ""green"" outputs.

From the provided data, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a ""green"" output, which is consistent throughout the examples. However, the fourth example also implies that ""walm"" could be ""yellow"" when followed by ""dax."" This contradictory information makes the rule less clear because there isn't enough context to determine why ""walm"" would be ""green"" in some instances and ""yellow"" in others.

Given this, the most straightforward conclusion based on the majority of the examples is:

Rule: ""walm"" -> ""green"" 

However, it is clear that the rule has at least one exception (or that the dataset is not consistent). Further examples would be needed to definitively ascertain the complete rule or context for when ""walm"" may not be ""green.""",0.8,156,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm"" we can analyze the patterns of input-output pairs to understand how the word correlates with the color outputs.

1. Inputs containing ""dax walm"" consistently output a ""green green green"" pattern, regardless of what comes after ""dax walm"". In the first and third examples, an additional color follows corresponding to the other word in the sequence (""red"" for ""wif"", ""yellow"" for ""zup"").

2. When ""walm"" appears without ""dax"" before it, as in examples 2 (dax lug walm) and 4 (wif zup walm dax zup), we don't see a consistent ""green green green"" pattern. In example 2, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"", and the pattern is ""blue blue blue"". In example 4, ""walm"" is in the middle and followed by ""dax"" and ""zup""; the output is a sequence of one ""red,"" three ""yellow,"" followed by a ""green"" and another ""yellow"".

3. When ""dax"" is immediately followed by ""walm"" without any other words between them, it results in a ""green green green"" pattern, as shown in examples 1, 3, and 5.

4. ""Walm"" does not consistently correlate with a single color output.

Considering the above points, it seems like ""walm"" may not have an independent meaning that translates to a particular color. Instead, it appears that the pattern ""dax walm"" results in a ""green green green"" output. Thus, ""walm"" might have a rule-based meaning tied to its position and context, specifically when combined with ""dax"".

Rule: When ""walm"" is immediately preceded by ""dax"", the output is ""green green green"". The word following ""walm"" is then translated to its corresponding color. However, ""walm"" on its own or not directly preceded by ""dax"" does not consistently translate to a specific color output.",0.8,156,walm
"To induce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can analyze the patterns in the examples provided.

1. In the case of ""dax walm wif,"" the output is ""green green green red.""
2. In the case of ""dax lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue blue blue.""
3. In the case of ""dax walm zup,"" the output is ""green green green yellow.""
4. In the case of ""wif zup walm dax zup,"" the output is ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow.""
5. In the case of ""dax walm,"" the output is ""green green green.""

First, we can notice that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in all examples where it appears at the beginning of the input. This suggests that ""dax"" does not impact the meaning of ""walm"" directly but rather has its independent output.

Now, let's focus on the use of ""walm"":
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" immediately, as in examples 1, 3, and 5, all instances of ""walm"" lead to the repeated output of ""green.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" is between ""dax"" and ""walm,"" and the first ""blue"" likely corresponds to ""lug,"" followed by three ""blue"" which correspond to ""walm,"" suggesting that ""walm"" may take on the color of the word immediately preceding it. However, since ""lug"" is not present in other examples, we cannot conclude that this is always the case.
- Example 4 is more complex, with ""wif"" leading to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""Walm"" comes after ""zup"" and leads to ""yellow green."" ""Dax"" again translates into ""green"" at the end of this sequence, followed by ""zup,"" which is consistent with ""yellow."" 

Given these observations, we can tentatively propose that ""walm"" might cause the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it, except when it follows ""dax,"" where ""dax"" seems to reset the color pattern to ""green."" However, if we look at the example with ""wif zup walm dax zup,"" we see that ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" yet the output for ""walm"" in this case is ""yellow green,"" not just ""yellow.""

This inconsistency makes it challenging to come up with a definitive rule for ""walm,"" and we may need additional examples to construct a more accurate rule. However, given the data we have, the best we can say is:

Rule: When ""walm"" immediately follows ""dax,"" it translates to ""green."" When ""walm"" follows another word, it may potentially repeat the color of the word that precedes it but is not consistent in doing so (as shown in example 4). More data is needed to establish a clear rule for ""walm"" in different contexts.",0.5,156,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Whenever ""lug"" is present in the input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Therefore, the rule can be written as:

lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""",1.0,157,lug
"Rule: ""lug"" -> blue

Based on the provided examples, every occurrence of the word ""lug"" directly corresponds to the output ""blue."" No matter the context or the position of ""lug"" in the input sequence, the output consistently remains ""blue"".",1.0,157,lug
"Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Here is the evidence supporting this conclusion:

- Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the same position in the output.

"Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color ""green."" The input ""dax"" by itself results in the output ""green,"" while in combination with other words, ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

"Rule: dax -> green

Explanation: Regardless of the context or additional words present, whenever the word 'dax' appears in the input, the output always includes 'green.' No other color is associated with 'dax' and its output is consistent across all examples.",1.0,157,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

From the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green."" Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words accompanying it, ""dax"" always maps to the color green.

Here's a breakdown of the inputs and outputs:

- Input: dax
  Output: green
  
  Single word input results in a single color output.
  
- Input: dax
  Output: green
  
  The same as the first example, reinforcing the rule.
  
- Input: lug dax
  Output: blue green
  
  The presence of another word ""lug"" results in an additional color ""blue"" being outputted before ""green"" which is associated with ""dax.""
  
- Input: wif bluf dax walm
  Output: red red green green green
  
  Here ""dax"" is in the middle of the sequence, but it still outputs ""green."" The other words (""wif"", ""bluf"", and ""walm"") result in other colors and repetitions (red, red, green, green respectively). It appears that ""bluf"" may be associated with repeating the previous color, although that's not the focus here.
  
- Input: lug dax lug wif
  Output: blue green blue red
  
  Again ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" This example also supports the idea that ""lug"" means ""blue"" and ""wif"" means ""red.""

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.",1.0,157,zup

- ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"", following the same principle where ""lug"" means blue.

"bluf -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""bluf"" appears to correspond with the color represented by the word that precedes it. 

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it.",1.0,157,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" represents the color that the preceding word denotes. The rule appears to be that when ""bluf"" is preceded by a word, the output is the color associated with that word, repeated twice.

Rule:
- ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"" (indicating that ""lug"" means ""blue"")
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" (indicating that ""wif"" means ""red"")
- In the example with multiple colors, such as ""zup lug zup bluf lug,"" we see ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue,"" indicating that ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and reinforcing that ""lug"" means ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule is that ""bluf"" causes the output to be the color of the word before it, and that color word is outputted twice.",1.0,157,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" does not have a fixed meaning on its own. Instead, its meaning depends on the word that precedes it. Here's the pattern that emerges from the examples:

dax lug bluf -> green blue blue
lug bluf -> blue blue
wif bluf -> red red
wif bluf -> red red
zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue

We can see that ""bluf"" repeats the color denoted by the word before it. Thus, the rule seems to be:

If the word before ""bluf"" is:
- ""lug,"" then ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif,"" then ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup,"" then ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax lug,"" then ""bluf"" still corresponds to ""blue""

However, this is a bit more complex because in the example ""dax lug bluf,"" it seems ""dax"" influences the color to become ""green,"" not just ""lug."" Still, ""bluf"" takes the color from its immediate predecessor, which is ""blue"" due to ""lug.""

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color indicated by the preceding word.",1.0,157,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it. We can deduce the rule by examining each instance of ""walm"":

1. In ""dax lug dax lug walm,"" the word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue."" The output for ""walm"" is ""blue blue,"" which means ""walm"" has resulted in repeating the color ""blue.""

2. In ""lug walm zup,"" following ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" ""walm"" leads to ""blue blue."" ""Zup"" is a different color, ""yellow,"" so it isn't repeated — this indicates that ""walm"" is only repeating the color immediately before it.

3. In ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" is again before ""walm"" and translates to ""blue."" Hence, ""walm"" results in ""blue blue.""

4. In ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" results in ""red red,"" repeating the color immediately before it.

5. In ""lug dax walm wif,"" the color before ""walm"" is ""green"" from ""dax,"" and the output for ""walm"" is ""green green."" ""Wif"" comes after ""walm"" and is a different color, ""red.""

From these examples, we can derive the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeats the color of the word that precedes it.",1.0,157,walm
"Analyzing the provided examples, we observe the following pattern:

In the first example:
- dax -> green (repeats twice)
- lug -> blue (repeats twice)
- walm -> blue blue (appended to the output after ""lug"")

In the second example:
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue blue (appended to the output after ""lug"")
- zup -> yellow

In the third example:
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue blue (appended to the output after ""lug"")

In the fourth example:
- wif -> red
- walm -> red red (appended to the output after ""wif"")

In the fifth example:
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> green green (appended to the output after ""dax"")
- wif -> red

From these examples, we can deduce the following pattern for walm: walm seems to double the color that was output just before it.

Rule:
walm -> Doubles the previously mentioned color.
",1.0,157,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" translates to repeating the color of the word that precedes it two times. Here is the analysis:

- In the first example, ""dax lug dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue green blue blue blue"". After ""lug"" which translates to ""blue"", we see ""blue blue"", indicating that ""walm"" may mean to double the previous color.

- In the second example, ""lug walm zup"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow"", again showing that after ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" leads to two more ""blue"".

- In the third example, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue"". After ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" results in ""blue blue"".

- In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"", indicating that after ""wif"" (red), ""walm"" results in ""red red"".

- In the fifth example, ""lug dax walm wif"" translates to ""blue green green green red"". After ""dax"" (green), ""walm"" produces ""green green"". 

Therefore, the general rule appears to be: ""walm"" -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word two times.

Rule: walm means repeating the previously mentioned color, doubling its occurrence.",1.0,157,walm
"Based on the examples provided and their corresponding outputs, it seems that ""walm"" has a rule related to repeating the color of the word that comes directly before it. Whenever ""walm"" appears, the output is a sequence of the color that correlates to the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" but with a repetition of that color. Here is how the rule applies to each input:

1. ""dax lug dax lug walm"": ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" corresponds to blue. Since ""lug"" is before ""walm,"" the output is blue repeated twice.
2. ""lug walm zup"": ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so after ""lug,"" blue is repeated twice for ""walm"" before moving on to ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow.
3. ""dax lug walm"": ""lug"" before ""walm"" corresponds to blue, hence blue is repeated twice after ""lug.""
4. ""wif walm"": ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""walm"" translates to red repeated twice.
5. ""lug dax walm wif"": ""dax"" before ""walm"" corresponds to green, hence two greens for ""walm"" before the sequence ends with ""wif"" as red.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word twice.",1.0,157,walm
"From the given examples, we can induce the following patterns in relation to the nonce word ""walm"":

1. When ""walm"" follows ""dax lug"", the output is ""blue blue"".
2. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue blue"".
3. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the output is ""blue blue"".
4. When ""walm"" stands alone (only ""wif"" follows), the output is ""red red"".
5. When ""walm"" precedes ""wif"", the output associated with ""walm"" is ""green green"".

Attempting to induce a general rule from these patterns, it seems that ""walm"" may correspond to repeating the color of the previous word or, if there is no clear previous association, repeating a default color. However, the patterns are inconsistent with this rule because ""lug"" should follow the rule, but ""lug dax walm wif"" outputs ""green green"" for ""walm"" instead of ""blue blue"". Also, if ""walm"" stands alone followed by ""wif"", we would expect a default color, and yet the output is ""red red"", which is not consistent with other instances of ""walm"".

Therefore, given the inconsistencies and the limited data, the rule might be dependent on the preceding word:

- ""walm"" after ""dax lug"" -> repeat the color of ""lug"" (blue blue)
- ""walm"" after ""lug"" -> repeat the color of ""lug"" (blue blue)
- ""walm"" after ""dax"" -> repeat the color of ""dax"" (blue blue)
- ""walm"" with ""wif"" -> either repeat the color red because ""wif"" is red, or default to red

Despite the attempt to find a consistent rule, more examples are needed to accurately define what ""walm"" means unambiguously. The partial rule, with inconsistencies acknowledged, is as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" generally seems to mean repeat the color of the preceding word twice. If followed by ""wif"", or standing alone, it defaults to red regardless of previous patterns.",0.3,157,walm

"Rule: lug -> blue

"lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"", and ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".",1.0,158,lug
"To determine the rule for the nonce word ""dax,"" we should look at each instance where it's used and the corresponding output to find a pattern.

1. Input: ""wif dax bluf"" 
   Output: ""red green green""
   
2. Input: ""zup dax bluf""
   Output: ""yellow green green""
   
3. Input: ""dax wif""
   Output: ""green red""
   
4. Input: ""wif walm dax zup""
   Output: ""red red red green yellow""

5. Input: ""dax bluf zup""
   Output: ""green green yellow""

Analyzing the outputs corresponding to the positions where ""dax"" appears in the inputs gives us the following observations:

- ""dax"" always translates into ""green"" regardless of its position. 
- Other words (""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup,"" ""walm"") appear to translate consistently into their respective colors as well (""red,"" ""green,"" ""yellow,"" ""red""). 
- ""dax"" does not seem to be dependent on nearby words, as it always results in ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,158,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,158,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we will examine the outputs corresponding to each input where ""dax"" appears.

Output: yellow green green

Input: dax wif  
Output: green red

Input: wif walm dax zup  
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: dax bluf zup  
Output: green green yellow

From these examples, we deduce that whenever ""dax"" appears, the word ""green"" immediately follows in the output. This behavior remains consistent regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input string or the words that precede or follow it. Therefore, it suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,158,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's compare the input with their corresponding outputs:

1. *wif dax bluf* -> red green green
2. *zup dax bluf* -> yellow green green
3. *dax wif* -> green red
4. *wif walm dax zup* -> red red red green yellow
5. *dax bluf zup* -> green green yellow

By analyzing the inputs and their outputs, we can see that every time the word ""dax"" appears, the word ""green"" is in the corresponding position in the output. It doesn't matter what words precede or follow ""dax""; the output for ""dax"" is consistently ""green."" Additionally, none of the other words seem to correspond to ""green"" in the output.

So, using this analysis, we can determine the rule for ""dax"":

Rule: dax -> green,1.0,158,dax
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red."" There doesn't seem to be any variation in the output linked to the presence of ""wif,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present. Thus, we can deduce a straightforward meaning for the nonce word ""wif.""

wif -> meaning: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" is included in the output sequence at the corresponding position.",1.0,158,wif

- ""wif lug"" outputs ""red blue""
- ""wif"" alone outputs ""red""
- ""wif bluf lug"" outputs ""red red blue""
- ""lug wif bluf"" outputs ""blue red red""

Looking at the pattern, whenever the word ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output is ""red."" It happens irrespective of the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence. No other input word corresponds to ""red"" every time but ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" is that it is associated with the color red in the output.

First, we notice that whenever ""wif"" is in the input, the corresponding output contains ""red."" Here are the specific correlations:

1. ""dax bluf wif"" results in ""green green red"" — ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
2. ""wif lug"" results in ""red blue"" — ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
3. ""wif"" by itself results in ""red""
4. ""wif bluf lug"" results in ""red red blue"" — ""wif"" correlates with ""red"" once again
5. ""lug wif bluf"" results in ""blue red red"" — ""wif"" correlates with the second ""red"" when considering the order in the input.

- In Example 4, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), resulting in ""blue blue"" in the output.
- In Example 5, ""walm"" first follows ""dax"" (green), resulting in ""green green,"" and later ""wif"" (red), resulting in ""red red.""

The rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it duplicates the color of the word that precedes it in the sequence.

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""",1.0,159,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue"".",1.0,159,lug
"From the given examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sentence or the other words present. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.",1.0,159,lug

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color blue in each provided example.",1.0,159,lug
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following pattern:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the output color is ""green.""
- The word ""dax"" seems to be independent of its position in the sentence.
- The word ""dax"" consistently correlates with the same output, regardless of the words that come before or after it.

We can therefore deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs. Other words, such as ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""bluf,"" correspond to other colors, but since we are only asked to determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we focus only on the pattern associated with this word.

Rule: dax -> ""green""",1.0,159,dax
"To figure out the meaning of ""dax"" from the given examples, let's look for patterns by examining each example's input and the corresponding output:

Input: dax zup wif zup
Output: green yellow red yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: dax zup
Output: green yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Input: lug dax wif
Output: blue green red
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
Output: green green red blue yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
Output: green green red yellow green
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Based on these examples, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in each context it appears, regardless of the position or the other words around it.

Rule: dax -> ""green""",1.0,159,dax
"dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in each given example, regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,159,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax"", let's look at the patterns in the examples provided:

1. `dax zup wif zup` -> `green yellow red yellow`
2. `dax zup` -> `green yellow`
3. `lug dax wif` -> `blue green red`
4. `dax bluf wif lug zup` -> `green green red blue yellow`
5. `dax bluf wif zup dax` -> `green green red yellow green`

Here are the observed patterns:

- Every time ""dax"" appears, the word ""green"" is produced in the output.
- The appearance of ""dax"" does not depend on its position in the sequence since it can be in the beginning, middle, or end, and it still translates to ""green.""

From these observations we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,159,dax
"Based on the examples given, it seems that each word corresponds to a specific color. Here are the associations based on the input and output pairs:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red

- dax -> green

Thus, regardless of its position in the sequence, 'dax' consistently translates to 'green'. There is no context-based variability in the meaning of 'dax' in the supplied examples. 

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,159,dax
"wif -> red

It does not seem to be affected by the presence of other words, as in the second example where ""zup lug"" results in ""yellow blue,"" but the inclusion of ""wif"" output remains ""red."" Even when ""wif"" is repeated, as in the fourth example, the number of times ""wif"" is mentioned corresponds to the number of times ""red"" is outputted. 

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:

- The word 'zup' consistently translates to 'yellow' every time it appears.

From the first three examples:
- Input: zup / Output: yellow
- Input: zup / Output: yellow

In the more complex fourth example, we can match each instance of 'lug' with 'blue', and each 'zup' with 'yellow', as they are consistent with the simpler examples. Even though the other words ('bluf' and 'dax' and 'walm') appear, they translate respectively to 'blue', 'green', and 'yellow', but do not inform the meaning of 'zup'.

Therefore, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: zup means yellow.",1.0,159,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look closely at the correspondence between the inputs and the outputs, paying special attention to the presence of ""bluf"" and the associated output colors.

- zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
- zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> yellow yellow red green red yellow
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- zup lug bluf zup bluf wif -> yellow blue blue yellow yellow red

From these examples, we can observe that the output colors correspond to specific words in the input, and the word ""bluf"" always results in the output color ""yellow"" directly following its occurrence.

In every instance, the occurrence of ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow"" in the output. The other words, such as ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif,"" also have a consistent color associated with them. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

So, we can deduce:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,159,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

- In the first example, ""dax"" results in ""green,"" and ""bluf"" repeats that color.
- In the second example, ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" repeats ""yellow,"" followed by ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
- In the third example, ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" repeats ""yellow,"" and so on with ""wif"" resulting in ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" ""bluf"" repeats ""blue,"" then ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" again, followed by ""bluf"" which repeats the ""yellow,"" and finally, ""wif"" is ""red.""

So, the rule is:

bluf -> Repeat the color code of the word immediately before it.",1.0,159,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. Every time the word ""bluf"" is used, the output is a color (either green or yellow).
2. The color that follows ""bluf"" seems to be dependent on the word that precedes it.
3. ""dax"" before ""bluf"" always results in ""green.""
4. ""zup"" before ""bluf"" always results in ""yellow.""
5. ""lug"" before ""bluf"" changes the color to ""blue,"" but it doesn't change when ""zup"" follows it.
6. It is unclear what impact ""wif"" has on the color directly related to ""bluf"" since it does not precede ""bluf"" in the examples.

Thus, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be dependent on the word directly preceding it:

Rule: ""bluf"" converts the preceding word into a specific color code. Here are the specifics:

- If the preceding word is ""dax,"" then ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""
- If the preceding word is ""zup,"" then ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- If the preceding word is ""lug,"" then ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue."" (Note: the output does not repeat for another ""bluf"" if ""zup"" is in-between them.)

So, the rule deduced is:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: A color code dependent on the immediate preceding word (dax -> green, zup -> yellow, lug -> blue).",0.9,159,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze its relationship with other words in the sentence and the corresponding output colors:

1. dax bluf -> green green
2. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
3. zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> yellow yellow red green red yellow
4. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
5. zup lug bluf zup bluf wif -> yellow blue blue yellow yellow red

Looking at examples 1 and 2, we see that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and ""zup"" always results in yellow. 

Considering example 3, ""wif"" appears to be red if it is between or after ""zup"" and ""dax,"" yet it is not the end of the output pattern, which rules out position being relevant to its color. This suggests that ""wif"" doesn't have an inherent color but possibly takes on the color corresponding to its position relative to other tokens.

In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and produces an extra yellow, suggesting it either echos or duplicates the preceding color.

Example 5 introduces a new word, ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color blue. ""bluf"" follows both ""zup lug"" and ""zup,"" and in both instances, it outputs the color of the preceding word. 

From these patterns, we can deduce that ""bluf"" likely duplicates the color of the word that comes immediately before it. So, if ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, the output is yellow. If it follows ""lug"" (blue), then it results in blue.

"walm -> repeats the color of the previous word. 

Rule: When the word 'walm' is used, it refers to repeating the color that corresponds to the word just before it in the sequence.

If 'walm' follows 'lug,' which corresponds to blue, 'walm' will correspond to blue, and so on.",1.0,159,walm
Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color three times.,1.0,159,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it in the sequence. Here is the analysis for each example:

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""wif"" translates to red, and the presence of ""walm"" right after it leads to ""red"" being repeated two additional times for a total of three instances of red.

2. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   - Here, ""lug"" translates to blue, and ""walm"" right after it results in blue being repeated two more times, following the same pattern as in the first example.

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   - In this example, ""lug"" comes before ""walm,"" which once again causes blue to be repeated for a total of three instances of blue.

4. Input: zup walm

   - This example is similar to the first, with ""zup"" translating to yellow and repeated two additional times due to the presence of ""walm.""

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm

   - Once again, ""lug"" is before ""walm,"" resulting in blue being repeated for a total of three blues.

Rule:
walm -> when following a color word, it causes that color word to repeat two additional times (triples the appearance of the color mentioned directly before ""walm"").",1.0,159,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns where it appears and the corresponding output:

1. Wherever ""walm"" appears, the following color sequence in the output is ""red.""
2. The quantity of ""red"" in the output depends on the number of words that follow ""walm.""
    - Example 1: ""walm"" is followed by zero words and there are zero ""red.""
    - Example 2: ""walm"" is followed by one word, and there is one ""red.""
    - Example 3: ""walm"" is followed by one word, and there is one ""red.""
    - Example 4: ""walm"" is followed by two words, and there are two ""red.""
3. The colors in the output seem to be mapped from the input words such that ""zup"" -> ""yellow,"" ""lug"" -> ""blue,"" and ""wif"" -> ""red,"" which is consistent, except when ""walm"" occurs.
4. The first example suggests that when ""walm"" appears as the last word, the output is a repetition of ""yellow,"" which is the output for the word ""zup.""

Based on these patterns, the rule for ""walm"" could be the following:

Rule: ""walm"" results in repeated ""red"" in the output, with the number of repetitions equal to the number of words following ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Thus:
walm -> meaning: The word ""walm"" acts as a command for repeating the color ""red"" in the output, contingent on the number of terms that follow ""walm"" within the input. If ""walm"" is the final word, the color corresponding to the previous word is repeated instead.",0.8,159,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns present in the given examples and the corresponding outputs to infer the underlying rules.

Looking at the examples:

1. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
2. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red""
3. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue""
4. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue""

From these examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- When ""walm"" is present in the sequence, the following color after its occurrence is repeated up to three times, depending on the number of words following ""walm"". For example:
    - In Example 1, ""walm"" is followed by no words, so there are no repetitions.
    - In Example 4, ""walm"" is the last word, and it is echoed as ""yellow"" three times.
    - In Example 5, ""walm"" is followed by zero words, so the color ""blue"" that corresponds to the word before ""walm"" is not repeated after it.
    - In Example 3, ""dax"" comes after ""walm,"" and it gets a unique color, ""green.""
    - In Example 2, there are words following ""walm"" but not immediately after, so it does not get repeated.

Considering the above observations, it seems that ""walm"" is not directly associated with a specific color output but rather dictates that the next color (if there is a word following ""walm"") should be repeated up to three times, depending on the context.

Therefore, the rule is:

walm -> The color corresponding to the first word immediately following ""walm"" in the sequence (if there is one) will be repeated up to three times. If no word follows ""walm,"" then ""walm"" itself is represented by the repetition of the color corresponding to the word just before it, again up to three times. If ""walm"" is the last word with no words after it, the pattern dictates that the color of the word before ""walm"" is repeated three times.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's observe the patterns in each example. Notice that ""walm"" correlates with a specific color being repeated three times in the output. 

In the first example, ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" ""Zup"" relates to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to a single ""red."" ""Walm"" seems to cause the red to triple.

In the second example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" Here, ""dax"" results in a single ""green,"" and once again ""walm"" causes the color to triplicate.

Looking at the third pattern, ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow"" each time, and ""bluf lug"" translates to ""blue."" At the end where ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" there are three ""yellow"" in the output, implying ""walm"" tripled the preceding color once again.

The pattern holds in the fourth example, ""dax walm zup lug dax"" turning into ""green green green yellow blue green."" ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" here which had produced a single ""green,"" and the output shows three ""green.""

In the final example, ""dax walm wif walm zup"" corresponds to ""green green green red red red yellow."" ""Walm"" appears twice: once after ""dax"" (producing ""green green green"") and once after ""wif"" (producing ""red red red""). In both cases, it multiplies the preceding single color by three.

2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
3. ""zup"" on its own corresponds to ""yellow,"" but followed by ""walm"" it results in ""yellow"" repeated three times. Notice that in the third example, the repetition of ""zup"" both before and after ""lug"" does not change the output color for ""zup walm"", indicating that ""walm"" consistently triggers a triplet of the color that precedes it.
4. When ""walm"" is between ""dax"" and ""zup"", ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" repeated three times and ""zup"" with ""yellow"" once, consistent with the first and second examples. However, ""walm"" does not repeat the color ""yellow"" after it in the output.
5. When ""walm"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif"", the color ""green"" is repeated three times, and then after ""wif"" the color ""red"" is repeated three times. As before, ""walm"" does not influence the color that comes after it but affects the one that precedes it.

Rule: walm -> When used after another word representing a color, ""walm"" triggers the repetition of that color word three times in the output. If a color word does not precede ""walm"", then ""walm"" has no effect.",1.0,160,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the relationship between the inputs and outputs:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is a series of ""yellow"" with a quantity of one more than the number of words between ""zup"" and ""walm.""
  - Example: ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red"" (3 yellows)
  - Example: ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"" (4 yellows after the second ""zup"")

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is a series of ""green"" with a quantity equal to the number of ""dax"" words that appear before ""walm"" plus one more ""green"" for ""walm"" itself.
  - Example: ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"" (2 greens + 1 green for ""walm"")
  - Example: ""dax walm zup lug dax"" -> ""green green green yellow blue green"" (2 greens for ""dax"" + 1 green for ""walm"")
  - Example: ""dax walm wif walm zup"" -> ""green green green red red red yellow"" (3 greens for ""dax"" and ""walm"")

Based on this, ""walm"" seems to trigger the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. The number of repetitions is determined by the frequency of the preceding color-inducing word within the same statement before ""walm."" For ""zup"" that means a count equal to the number of words between the last ""zup"" and ""walm"" plus one, while for ""dax,"" it's equal to the number of ""dax"" plus one.

Rule: walm -> a trigger for repeating the color word output related to the preceding keyword, with the number of repetitions based on the presence and number of those keywords before ""walm"" within the same statement.",0.9,160,walm
"Observing the patterns from the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a repeated color based on the word preceding it. Each word seems to correspond to a specific color, and ""walm"" causes the color of the word before it to repeat. The rules seem to be:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- bluf -> blue
- lug -> blue (inferred from the 4th example where ""lug"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow blue"")

Thus, when ""walm"" follows any of these words, the corresponding color is repeated based on the rule set by the word before it. There's not enough information to determine what happens when ""walm"" is at the beginning of a sequence or if it is preceded by a word not provided in the examples.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the previous word the number of times specified by that word's rule.",0.9,160,walm

"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in the provided examples.",1.0,161,lug
"From the examples, we can figure out a pattern that corresponds to the nonce word ""lug."" The pattern in the given context suggests that each word translates to a specific color:

- zup corresponds to yellow
- walm corresponds to red
- dax corresponds to green
- bluf corresponds to blue
- wif corresponds to red

Given this pattern, whenever we see the word ""lug,"" it corresponds to the color blue. Therefore, the rule for ""lug"" in this context is:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,161,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" translates to the color blue. This is evidenced as follows:

"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of position or context of use within the given examples.",1.0,161,wif
"From the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Every input containing ""wif"" consistently results in ""red"" appearing in the output. There is no variation in this pattern, regardless of the presence or absence of other words accompanying ""wif."" Therefore, the most reasonable rule that can be induced from the given examples is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,161,wif
"Based on the provided examples, there is a consistent pattern where the presence of the word ""wif"" always results in the output ""red."" However, there isn't enough varied context to define ""wif"" beyond this association. It does not appear to modify or affect the output of other words, as the other words in the examples (""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""lug"") each correspond to their own unique color.

Thus, the rule for ""wif"" based on the given data is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,161,wif
"Based on the provided examples, each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words, ""wif"" consistently results in ""red"" in the output.

When the word ""zup"" appears, the output is always ""yellow"" irrespective of its position in the string of words. Hence, it is evident that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the colour yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,161,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,161,zup
"Looking at the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word 'zup' by examining its consistent output across different inputs:

Input: zup
Output: yellow

In this case, 'zup' directly translates to 'yellow'. Since there are no other words or context, this is straightforward.

When 'zup' is used in a sequence with other words, it always corresponds to 'yellow' regardless of the position or the words around it:

- In the second example, 'zup' is at the end of the sequence, and it translates to 'yellow'.
- In the third example, it is in the middle of the sequence (second position), and still, it is 'yellow'.
- In the fourth and fifth examples, 'zup' is at the beginning and it is still 'yellow'.

From these observations, regardless of the surrounding context or the position of 'zup' in a sequence, it consistently maps to the color 'yellow'. We do not have examples where 'zup' does not map to 'yellow' even when preceded or followed by other nonce words. There is no variation in the output that would suggest 'zup' has a relative or context-dependent meaning.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,161,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color word that directly precedes it in the input. To confirm this rule, let's observe how ""bluf"" changes in each example with its preceding color word:

- In the fourth input ""zup dax bluf"", ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", and the output is ""yellow green green."" ""Bluf"" takes the color of ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
- In the fifth input ""zup bluf dax lug"", ""bluf"" immediately follows ""zup"", and the output is ""yellow yellow green blue."" Here, ""bluf"" takes the color of ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

Here are the rules as seen from the examples:

1. When ""lug"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
2. When ""wif"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
3. When ""dax"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""

The rule also maintains the sequence of other colors when they are not affected by ""bluf,"" like so:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" (when not followed by ""bluf""),
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" (when not followed by ""bluf""),
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" (when not followed by ""bluf"").

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word that immediately follows it.,0.0,161,bluf
"Analyzing the given examples, it can be observed that the output sequence always has multiple occurrences of the same color following the word ""walm."" Therefore, ""walm"" seems to be associated with repetition. More specifically, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the nonce word immediately preceding it (""lug,"" ""zup,"" or ""dax"") to repeat until a new nonce word is introduced.

Here is the rule based on the examples provided:

- In the first input ""wif lug walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue"" and ""walm"" leads to the repetition of ""blue.""
- In the second input ""zup walm dax,"" ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow"" and precedes ""dax"" which is ""green."" The repetition is of ""yellow"" until ""dax"" changes it to green.
- In the third input, ""lug wif dax zup walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" leading to repeated ""yellow.""
- In the fourth input ""dax walm,"" ""walm"" again follows ""dax,"" which means ""green"" is repeated.
- In the fifth input, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and hence ""blue"" is repeated until ""dax"" changes it, and it doesn't repeat after the subsequent ""wif"" as there is another ""lug"" immediately after it.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to repeat until a new word appears. 

For example:
- ""lug walm"" -> blue repeated
- ""zup walm"" -> yellow repeated
- ""dax walm"" -> green repeated

Applying this rule to each example, we can confirm that the output matches the described pattern.",1.0,161,walm
"From the provided examples, we can infer the rule for the nonce word ""walm."" Here's the analysis:

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
Notice that ""walm"" corresponds to three repetitions of ""blue,"" which is the color associated with the preceding word ""lug.""

Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green
Here, ""walm"" corresponds to three repetitions of ""yellow,"" the color associated with the preceding word ""zup,"" before switching to ""green"" for ""dax.""

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
In this sequence, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and again corresponds to three repetitions of ""yellow.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in three repetitions of ""green.""

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
In this example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in three repetitions of the color ""blue"" before the pattern switches with a new word ""dax.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" represents a rule where the color associated with the immediately preceding word is repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,161,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we'll look at the patterns in the examples provided.

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Since ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of ""blue,"" it suggests that ""walm"" might mean a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes just before it.

Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green

""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Again ""walm"" precedes a repetition of the color associated with ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

Following the pattern we saw earlier, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" which is associated with ""yellow"" and results in a repetition of ""yellow.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Again, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" and results in a repetition of ""green.""

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which is ""blue""), leading to the repetition of ""blue."" 

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated one or more times.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,161,walm
"Observing the given examples, it seems that each word translates to a color, and the appearance of the nonce word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color that directly follows it, making ""walm"" a sort of duplicator for the next color word. Here’s the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""lug"" translates to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated three times, suggesting that ""walm"" caused ""blue"" to be output three times.
- In the second example, ""zup walm dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green."" ""Zup"" produces ""yellow,"" and since ""walm"" is before ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" it seems to triple the ""yellow"" before producing the green.
- In the third example, ""lug wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" and ""yellow"" is thus repeated three times.
- In the fourth and fifth examples, whenever ""walm"" appears, the color word after it is repeated multiple times.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> When ""walm"" appears before a color word, it causes that color word to be repeated three times in the output.",0.8,161,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should analyze the input-output patterns and see if there is a consistent correlation.

Here are the data points:

1. Input: wif lug walm — Output: red blue blue blue
2. Input: zup walm dax — Output: yellow yellow yellow green
3. Input: lug wif dax zup walm — Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
4. Input: dax walm — Output: green green green
5. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif — Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

Now, let's identify where ""walm"" is and what the output is:

1. wif lug **walm** — red blue **blue blue**
2. zup **walm** dax — yellow **yellow yellow** green
3. lug wif dax zup **walm** — blue red green yellow **yellow yellow**
4. dax **walm** — green **green green**
5. lug **walm** dax wif lug wif — blue **blue blue** green red blue red

By looking at the data points:

- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated.
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated.
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" repeated.
- When ""walm"" is the only word following another word, the output seems to be that color repeated an additional two times following the original color.

If we consider the colors as outputs for the words that precede ""walm,"" and ""walm"" causes a repetition of that color, we can draft a rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated twice more.",0.8,161,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: Based on the provided examples, every time the word ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue.""",1.0,162,lug

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,162,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe the following patterns:

- Whenever the word ""lug"" is used in the input, ""blue"" is produced in the corresponding position in the output.
- The other words ""walm"" and ""zup"" lead to ""blue"" and ""yellow"" respectively, regardless of their positions.
- The word ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,162,wif
"Based on the provided input-output pairs, we can attempt to deduce the rule or meaning of the nonce word ""wif.""

First, let's look at the commonalities:

1. Every time ""wif"" appears, the output includes ""red.""
2. The word ""wif"" can appear alone, or with other words before or after it.
3. When other words are present, they translate to different colors in the output:
    - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
    - ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
    - ""dax"" translates to ""green""
    - ""walm"" causes a repeated sequence of the color ""red""

Now let’s determine the rule by examining each case:

- ""zup wif"" gives ""yellow red,"" which suggests that ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""
- ""lug wif walm"" gives ""blue red red red,"" indicating that ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color ""red"" three times.
- ""wif"" alone gives ""red,"" further supporting that ""wif"" translates directly to ""red.""
- ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" provides a sequence of colors, where ""dax"" precedes ""wif"" and translates to ""green,"" followed by ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" then ""bluf"" has not been defined but still results in ""yellow,"" ""wif"" again is ""red,"" and ""walm"" again leads to a repeated sequence of ""red.""

Therefore, the rule for the word ""wif"" appears to be consistent with it meaning ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,162,wif

3. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue blue"" (The word before ""walm"" is ""lug"", which corresponds to the color blue, repeated four times.)
4. ""wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow"" (The word before ""walm"" is ""wif"", which corresponds to the color red, repeated three times, followed by another word ""zup"", which yields color yellow.)
5. ""lug walm zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow red"" (The word before ""walm"" is ""lug"", which corresponds to the color blue, repeated three times, followed by the colors yellow and red corresponding to ""zup"" and ""wif"" respectively.)

Based on this pattern, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" in the output, starting with three repetitions and increasing by one additional repetition for every word between the first instance of the repeated color and ""walm"".

Thus:

walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: Repeat the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" in the output, starting at three times and increasing by one for each word between.",1.0,162,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to correspond with repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times in the output. 

So, ""walm"" -> meaning would be connected to repetition based on the pattern observed.

1. ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"" - repeating ""blue"" three times
2. ""lug wif walm"" corresponds to ""blue red red red"" - repeating ""red"" three times after the color ""blue""
3. ""dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue"" - repeating ""blue"" three times after ""green""

5. ""lug walm zup wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue yellow red"" - repeating ""blue"" three times, followed by ""yellow"" and ""red""

Walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,162,walm
"Rule: walm seems to generate a sequence of a color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it, and it repeats that color three times.

Examples supporting the rule:

- lug walm -> blue blue blue (The word before walm is ""lug"" which corresponds to blue, and is repeated three times.)
- lug wif walm -> blue red red red (The word before walm is ""wif"" which corresponds to red, and is repeated three times.)
- dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue (The word before walm is ""lug"" which corresponds to blue, again repeated three times.)
- wif walm zup -> red red red (The word before walm is ""wif"" which corresponds to red, and is repeated three times. ""zup"" doesn't affect the output as it comes after walm.)
- lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red (Here the word before walm is ""lug"" corresponding to blue, repeated three times. The words ""zup"" and ""wif"" that come after ""walm"" contribute one yellow and one red to the sequence respectively.)

"Observing the examples provided, here's the deduction:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue."" The repetition of ""blue"" three times seems to indicate that ""lug"" means ""blue"" and ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color based on some condition or amount.

- In the second example, ""lug wif walm"" produces ""blue red red red,"" indicating that ""wif"" means ""red,"" and since ""walm"" follows ""lug wif,"" it generates a triplication of the color preceding it, which is red, and ""lug"" still corresponds to blue.

- In the third example, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" Here it seems that ""dax"" means ""green."" Since ""walm"" follows the color words ""dax lug"" (green blue), it repeats the last color mentioned, which is blue, three times.

- In the fourth example, ""wif walm zup"" results in ""red red red yellow."" Here ""wif"" still means ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats it three times. The word ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" suggesting it means ""yellow.""

- In the last example, ""lug walm zup wif"" produces ""blue blue blue yellow red."" ""Lug"" still corresponds to blue, ""walm"" causes the repetition of blue, ""zup"" adds yellow, and ""wif"" at the end adds red.

From these examples, we can establish the following rule for ""walm"":

- ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" which is not immediately clear but suggests that ""bluf"" could be associated with two occurrences of ""yellow.""

Thus, ""zup"" on its own means ""yellow,"" and when used in combination with another word, it could either retain its meaning or be influenced by the meaning attributed to the subsequent word. However, given that the only consistent translation is that ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" we can deduce the following:

"zup -> ""yellow""

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we can analyze the patterns in the given examples. Notice that ""zup"" appears in every input and ""yellow"" appears in every output, suggesting a one-to-one relationship between ""zup"" and ""yellow.""

Further examination reveals that the number of times ""yellow"" appears in the output may vary, which hints at a rule based on the additional words in the input. Here's what we can gather:

- ""zup lug"" outputs ""yellow blue,"" which indicates the word ""lug"" may correspond to ""blue.""
- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting the word ""walm"" may correspond to three instances of ""yellow.""
- ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow,"" indicating the word ""bluf"" might correspond to two instances of ""yellow.""

The rule we can infer here is that ""zup"" translates directly to ""yellow"" and that the subsequent words determine the number and type of colors that follow ""yellow"" in the output.

Based on the examples, here is the rule:

Rule: 
- ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the word ""blue.""
- ""walm"" introduces two additional instances of ""yellow"" to the sequence.
- ""bluf"" introduces an additional instance of ""yellow"" to the sequence.",0.8,163,zup
"bluf -> repeat the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it.

Rule: If a word is followed by ""bluf"", the output is the color associated with that word repeated twice. For instance, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green."" Similarly, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" hence ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red.""",1.0,163,bluf
"From the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" triggers the duplication of the output color corresponding to the word that is immediately before ""bluf"" in the input sequence. Here is the color association indicated by the examples:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow

Therefore, in each instance, when the word ""bluf"" is present, the color that corresponds to the word preceding ""bluf"" is repeated in the output. Let's analyze the examples to support this:

1. `dax bluf` => `green green`: Here, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and with ""bluf"" following it, the output is ""green"" repeated twice.
2. `wif bluf lug` => `red red blue`: In this sequence, ""wif"" is associated with red and is followed by ""bluf"" which causes ""red"" to be repeated; ""lug"" follows and corresponds to the color blue.
3. `lug bluf` => `blue blue`: ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and with ""bluf"" following it, the output is ""blue"" repeated twice.
4. `wif bluf` => `red red`: Similar to example 1, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" causes that color to be repeated in the output.
5. `zup wif bluf` => `yellow red red`: ""zup"" is associated with yellow, ""wif"" is associated with red, and because ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"", ""red"" is repeated in the output.

Therefore, the rule seems to be as follows:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes duplication of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. 

Or in a more concise notation:

bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,163,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that comes directly before ""bluf"" in the input.

When ""bluf"" follows these words, the color that corresponds to the preceding word is repeated in the output.

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be: when following a word that has a color association, repeat that color in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,163,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" results in a repeated color that corresponds to the word that comes just before it. Here are the observations from the inputs and outputs:

- ""dax bluf"" outputs ""green green,"" implying bluf follows the color indicated by ""dax"".
- ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red,"" implying bluf follows the color indicated by ""wif"".
- ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue,"" implying bluf follows the color indicated by ""lug"".
- ""wif bluf lug"" outputs ""red red blue,"" which shows ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red,"" while ""lug"" independently outputs ""blue"".
- ""zup wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow red red,"" showing that ""zup"" is ""yellow"" while ""wif bluf"" adheres to the previous pattern of ""red red"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it and repeats it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before it.",1.0,163,bluf
"From the examples provided, we can induce that the word ""bluf"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Let's examine the examples to deduce the rule:

- In ""dax bluf,"" the output is ""green green."" Hence, ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""
- In ""wif bluf lug,"" the output is ""red red blue."" It shows that ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and ""bluf"" causes the preceding color (""red"") to be repeated.
- In ""lug bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue."" This indicates that ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and again ""bluf"" repeats the color that comes before it.
- In ""wif bluf,"" the output is ""red red,"" reinforcing that ""wif"" is associated with ""red"" and ""bluf"" repeats it.
- In ""zup wif bluf,"" the output is ""yellow red red."" This tells us that ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word just before it, which in this case is ""red.""

The rule induced from these examples is:

Rule: bluf causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated.",1.0,163,bluf
"Analyzing the given examples where the nonce word ""walm"" has been used, we can try to find patterns in the output that correlate with the presence of ""walm."" Let's break down each example:

1. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   
In this sequence, the word right before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" After ""walm,"" we have ""lug wif,"" which translates to ""blue red."" Therefore, ""walm"" may be associated with the transition to ""blue.""

2. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   
Again, we see ""walm"" followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" This doesn't give us new information, but it reinforces that ""wif"" follows ""walm.""

3. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   
In this case, ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of ""green,"" which is different than the first example where it leads to blue. However, we can note that ""dax"" which correlates to ""green,"" is preceding ""walm.""

4. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red
   
Here, ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence and is followed by three ""red."" This might indicate a repetitive effect when ""walm"" is placed at the end.

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   
Like in the third example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" (green), suggesting ""walm"" may be linked to a repetition or continuation of the input before it, which is ""wif"" (red).

Across all examples, it appears that ""walm"" has the effect of repeating the color corresponding to the word that precedes it, sometimes with deviations when contextually necessitated (as seen in Example 1). 

Rule: ""walm"" -> duplicates the color word before it

Let's verify with each example:

1. wif (red) followed by walm results in red red, which fits the rule.
2. zup (yellow) followed by walm results in yellow yellow, fitting the rule.
3. dax (green) followed by walm results in green green green, which fits because it triggers repetition of green.
4. wif (red) followed by walm results in red red red, which fits the rule (the repetition continues possibly due to ""walm"" being at the end).
5. wif (red) followed by walm results in red red, fitting the rule.

Therefore, ""walm"" is most likely a modifier that triggers repetition of the color indicated by the word that comes immediately before it.",0.8,163,walm
"Observing the sequence of inputs and outputs, it appears that each word correlates to a specific color in the output:

- wif -> red
- bluf -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow

Reviewing each example to find the rule for ""walm"":

1. In the first example, walm is preceded by reds and followed by a blue. However, before walm appears, the pattern is alternating red and green, ending with red red.

2. In the second example, walm is the second word and is followed by red. Both the previous and the following words are red, giving us less information about walm alone.

3. In the third example, walm follows two greens, which were not directly preceded by reds.

4. In the fourth example, walm follows reds and is itself followed by red again.

5. In the fifth example, walm follows two reds.

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" might follow a rule related to the preceding colors and not necessarily producing a fixed color itself, as it is both preceded and followed by various colors.

However, one similarity across examples where walm leads to green in the output, it is always preceded by red at least once. Plus, looking at the only instance where it's not followed by green (example 1: lug wif walm), the pattern red-red is preceding the word walm. Thus, we could hypothesize that ""walm"" likely means that it repeats the previous color unless that color is red, in which case the output is green. Let's re-evaluate the examples with this potential rule:

1. walm follows red-red, so the output is green (this fits our hypothesis).
2. walm follows red, so the output is green (fits).
3. walm follows green, so the output is green (does not fit, unless we consider that it also needs a red before green to maintain green).
4. walm follows red-red, so the output is green (fits).
5. walm follows red-red, so the output is green (fits).

The third example seems to be an exception, which could suggest that the presence of red before a green might be required to maintain green after a ""walm"", not just repeating the previous color.

Therefore, a tentative rule could be that ""walm"" requires the presence of at least one red before any sequence of greens to maintain the output as green; otherwise, ""walm"" translates the previous red into green. If the previous color is not red, then it might repeat the previous color. Due to the exception in the third example, this rule is not definitive and requires further examples to confirm.

Rule: walm -> If the preceding color is red (with or without consecutive greens following), the output is green. If the preceding color is something else, it repeats that color.",0.8,163,walm
"To deduce the meaning or rule behind ""walm,"" let's look at each instance and see what precedes or follows it and the corresponding colors:

1. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> red red green green red red blue red
   Here 'walm' is followed by 'lug' and the pattern changes from red-red to red-blue.

2. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
   Here 'walm' is between 'zup' and 'wif', with 'zup' being yellow and 'wif' red. The presence of 'walm' resulted in 'wif' turning to red instead of continuing yellow.

3. wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green
   'walm' follows 'dax', and we see that the color sequence green continues after 'walm'.

4. lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red
   Here 'walm' is at the end, after 'wif,' and the color red is repeated.

5. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
   'walm' is after 'wif', with the pattern continuing with red before changing due to 'dax' and 'zup'.

From these examples, it appears that 'walm' has the ability to continue the existing color pattern regardless of what would normally follow after 'walm'. When 'walm' appears, it causes the next word to take the color of the word that precedes 'walm', instead of following the color that would typically be associated with that word if 'walm' was not there.

Rule: walm -> Continues the color pattern/sequence of the preceding word.",0.8,163,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze its associated outputs in the given examples:

1. In the first example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" -> ""red red green green red red red blue red,"" we can deduce the following:
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""dax"" has been used twice; once it corresponds to ""green"" and once to ""green green.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

   We can notice that ""walm"" appears before ""lug"" (which is ""blue"") and after two occurrences of ""wif"" (""red""). The output for ""walm"" in this instance is the third ""red"" before ""blue.""

2. In the second example, ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" we see the following:
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""wif"" at the end of the sequence corresponds to ""red.""

   In this example, ""walm"" precedes ""wif"" (""red"") and follows ""zup"" (""yellow""). The corresponding output for ""walm"" is the same color as ""wif"" (""red"").

3. In the third example, ""wif lug dax walm"" -> ""red blue green green green,"" we see:
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

   Here, ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" (which is ""green"") and the output is ""green green.""

4. In the fourth example, ""lug wif zup wif walm"" -> ""blue red yellow red red red,"" we have:
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

   Once again, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (""red"") and its output is ""red red.""

5. In the fifth example, ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow,"" the scenario is:
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

   ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (""red"") and precedes ""dax"" (""green""), with the output being ""red red.""

From the above examples, it appears that ""walm"" may result in repeating the color of the word that comes after it. However, since this pattern does not hold consistently for ""dax,"" which sometimes outputs ""green"" or ""green green,"" it suggests that there might be an additional rule affecting the number of times the color is repeated.

Taking the third example into consideration, where ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and results in ""green green,"" it could suggest that ""walm"" doubles the color that follows it. However, in the fourth example, ""walm"" triples the color red.

With the data presented, a conclusive rule for ""walm"" is difficult to pin down without further examples or patterns. It is likely that ""walm"" causes repetition of the color word that follows it, but the exact nature of the repetition (double, triple, etc.) does not have a clear and consistent rule across the provided examples.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the following word, with the exact nature of repetition being unclear based on the provided data.",0.7,163,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the input sequences and their corresponding outputs. Let's start by observing the occurrences of ""walm"" and the corresponding color output:

1. wif walm lug wif -> red red red blue red
2. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
3. wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green
4. lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red
5. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow

Now let's compare these with inputs and outputs where ""walm"" is not present:

1. wif bluf dax bluf wif -> red red green green red
2. wif -> red
3. zup -> yellow
4. lug -> blue
5. dax -> green

From the above, we see that each individual word corresponds to a specific color:

- wif -> red
- bluf -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

Now we can look at the patterns of ""walm"" in relation to these:

1. In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" which is red, but the output for ""walm"" is also yellow, the same as the preceding color for ""zup.""
2. In the third example, ""walm"" is at the end and leads to three consecutive green outputs. This does not follow a clear consistency.
3. In the fourth example, ""walm"" precedes two reds, which is the same color as ""wif.""
4. In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" (green), but the output for ""walm"" is red, the same as the preceding color for ""wif.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" may be a modifier that repeats the color immediately preceding it:

- In example 1, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" which is red, so ""walm"" leads to an extra red.
- In example 2, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" which is yellow, so ""walm"" leads to extra yellows.
- In example 3, there is some inconsistency; however, if we consider ""dax"" as the word that triggers green, ""walm,"" by being at the end, seems to extend the color green from ""dax.""
- In example 4, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" leading to extra reds, which aligns with our prior observations.
- In example 5, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and is then followed by ""dax,"" which is green. This does not seem to affect the rule deduced, as ""wif"" still leads to an extra red output for ""walm.""

Based on these observations, a plausible rule for ""walm"" could be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the next word's color output (or previous color if at the end or there is no subsequent color word) to be repeated by an additional amount dependent on context. The exact rule for the repetition amount is not consistent across all examples, but ""walm"" consistently influences repetition of a certain color.",0.7,163,walm

"Based on the examples provided, we can make the following observations:

1. Every time the word ""wif"" appears, regardless of position or surrounding words, ""red"" appears in the output.
2. No other output color is associated with the input ""wif"".

Now, we can analyze the other words and their corresponding colors to ensure that ""wif"" solely corresponds to ""red"":

- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" as it appears in the output every time ""zup"" is in the input.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when it follows ""zup"" (in the example, ""zup dax wif"").
- ""walm"" might be related to the repetition of ""red"" due to its position following ""wif,"" but since ""wif"" itself corresponds to a single ""red,"" the additional ""reds"" could be due to ""walm.""

Considering this analysis, we can conclude the following:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the outputs irrespective of its position or the presence of other words.",1.0,164,wif

Input: zup lug wif -> Output: yellow blue red
Input: zup -> Output: yellow
Input: wif zup bluf wif dax -> Output: red yellow yellow red green
Input: zup lug -> Output: yellow blue

We can induce that each word translates into a specific color:

- zup always translates to ""yellow""
- lug, when mentioned, translates to ""blue""
- wif appears to always translate to ""red""
- bluf, likely due to its similarity to ""blue"" combined with ""f"" at the end, seems to be another way to say ""yellow""
- dax translates to ""green""

Given that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in each instance it appears, we can induce the rule:

"Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the word ""yellow"" except when it follows ""dax,"" in which case ""bluf"" translates to ""green."" Here is the rule based on the examples:

Rule: 
bluf -> ""yellow"" if it does not follow ""dax""
bluf -> ""green"" if it directly follows ""dax""",1.0,164,bluf
"Based on the examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color represented by the word preceding it. Here's the breakdown:

1. In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is ""red red"". This suggests ""bluf"" takes the color of ""wif"", which is ""red"".
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and results in two ""yellow"" in the output, inferring that ""bluf"" here means ""yellow"".
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and results in two ""yellow"" in the output, inferring that ""bluf"" here also means ""yellow"".
4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is ""green"". This suggests ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax"", which is ""green"".
5. In the fifth example, ""lug"" comes before ""bluf"" and both translate to ""blue"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".

Rule: ""bluf"" means the same color as the word that comes right before it.",1.0,164,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Here's the reasoning:

- In the first example, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red"" in the output. However, the original sequence starts with ""zup wif dax,"" which translates to ""yellow red green."" When ""wif"" repeats, it is ""red"" again, so it seems that ""bluf"" appears out of the sequence pattern concluding that ""bluf"" itself may introduce the color ""yellow.""

- In the second example, the word ""bluf"" directly precedes a sequence that leads to the output ""yellow blue yellow,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" to maintain the pattern.

- In the third example, ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" and the sequence ""wif lug dax"" translates to ""red blue green."" Given that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" it's likely that ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow"" to ensure the pattern aligns with the output.

- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is between two instances of ""dax,"" and the corresponding colors are ""green,"" ""green"" with ""bluf"" producing a ""yellow"" in between. This again indicates that regardless of its position, ""bluf"" leads to the color ""yellow.""

- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" directly follows ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" and the output is ""blue blue,"" hence the pair ""lug bluf"" seems to indicate twice the same color, which is blue. However, as all previous instances showed ""bluf"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" it seems that ""bluf"" represents ""yellow"" and the repetition of ""blue"" in the output might be a coincidence or pattern that's not explained by the provided examples.

Rule: bluf -> yellow",0.8,164,bluf
"To deduce the rule for the word ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs carefully and look for patterns.

- Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
  Output: yellow red green red red
  Analysis: ""zup""->yellow, ""wif""->red, ""dax""->green.
  
- Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
  Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
  Analysis: ""zup""->yellow, ""lug""->blue, ""walm""->yellow (it seems that ""walm"" is also translated to ""yellow"").

- Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
  Output: yellow yellow red blue green
  Analysis: ""zup""->yellow, ""wif""->red, ""lug""->blue, ""dax""->green.
  
- Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
  Output: yellow green green yellow green
  Analysis: ""zup""->yellow, ""dax""->green.

- Input: lug bluf
  Output: blue blue
  Analysis: ""lug""->blue.

Looking at the pattern, we can see that ""bluf"" tends to be followed by the color that represents the word that precedes it. The evidence for this is stronger in examples where ""bluf"" is preceded by a single word, such as ""lug bluf"" resulting in ""blue blue."" However, in examples with more words preceding ""bluf,"" such as ""zup wif dax wif bluf,"" it's not clear why ""bluf"" results in an additional ""red"" rather than repeating the color of its immediate predecessor (which would be ""green"" in this case).

Given this inconsistency, we have to look for an alternative pattern that can account for all instances. Notably, when ""bluf"" is not present, each word seems to have a consistent color association, as inferred from the corresponding outputs.

From the provided data and the inconsistencies observed, it's difficult to establish a definitive rule for ""bluf."" However, the closest pattern we can infer is that ""bluf"" often repeats the color of the word preceding it but might also incorporate an additional pattern that is not evident from the given examples.

Given the inconsistencies and the inability to establish a firm rule, I will provisionally suggest the following, with an acknowledgment that it may not be entirely accurate:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word that precedes it, with possible additional patterns that are not clear from the given examples.",0.6,164,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, each nonce word seems to correspond to a color. The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" no matter the context within the given input strings.

Rule: bluf -> yellow",0.0,164,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to produce the output ""blue blue blue"" every time it is used. Whenever ""walm"" is mentioned in the input, three consecutive ""blue"" colors are produced in the output. It's also apparent that no other word in the input generates exactly three consecutive ""blue"" outputs.

Here is a breakdown of the examples:

- In Example 1, ""wif dax lug walm"" leads to ""red green blue blue blue"", and we can see that ""wif"", ""dax"", and ""lug"" correspond to ""red"", ""green"", and ""blue"" respectively, while ""walm"" is followed by three ""blue"".
- In Example 2, ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" generates ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red"", and again, each word corresponds to a single color except for ""walm"", which is followed by three instances of ""yellow"", deviating from the usual color association with ""zup"" which is ""yellow"" but they are not affected since they precede ""walm"".
- Example 3, ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow"", where ""wif"" is ""red"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""walm"" once more corresponds to three repetitions of ""blue"".
- Example 4, ""zup wif dax walm"" outputs ""yellow red green green green"", which fits the established one-to-one correspondence for all words but ""walm"", which again triggers three ""green"".
- Finally, Example 5, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" turns into ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"", we see the pattern hold true for individual words and three ""yellow"" colors appear for ""walm"" following the previous ""zup"".

Rule: walm -> meaning. Walm causes a repetition of three instances of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. If it is the first word or if the previous word has no associated color, the default color appears to be blue.",1.0,164,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer that each nonce word is associated with a specific color in the output. Here’s what we can derive from the examples:

- Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is ""red.""
- Every time ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green.""
- Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue.""
- Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow.""

Now let's look at where ""walm"" appears:

1. In the first input, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is a sequence of three ""blue.""
2. In the second input, it precedes ""dax"" and follows ""zup,"" and the output contains one ""green.""
3. In the third input, it is preceded and followed by ""wif,"" and the output contains repeated ""red.""
4. In the fourth input, it follows ""dax,"" and the output is two greens that follow.
5. In the fifth input, ""walm"" is the final input, where ""zup"" precedes it, and the output ends with repeated ""yellow.""

Thus, we can infer that ""walm"" acts as a multiplier for the color corresponding to the nonce word that either immediately precedes or follows it. When ""walm"" appears, it causes the next color in the sequence to repeat multiple times. It is not entirely clear if it's the preceding or the following color that influences ""walm"" without contradictory examples, but with the examples given, either could be true.

Rule: walm -> The corresponding color of the word either immediately before or after ""walm"" in the input is repeated multiple times in the output.",0.9,164,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in each example where the nonce word is used.

1. ""wif dax lug walm"" -> ""red green blue blue blue""
2. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red""
3. ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow""
4. ""zup wif dax walm"" -> ""yellow red green green green""
5. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" -> ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow""

Now let's see if we can discern a pattern. Whenever ""walm"" appears, it is translated to ""blue"". However, the number of times ""blue"" is repeated seems to vary based on the example. If we associate ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"" with their respective colors ""red,"" ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" and ""green,"" we can try to understand the pattern based on these associations.

- In the first example, after ""walm,"" we see ""blue"" repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by a single ""green.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" is followed twice by ""red.""
- In the fourth example, there are two ""green"" after ""walm.""
- In the fifth example, three ""yellow"" follow after ""walm.""

It seems like the word ""walm"" is followed by a color which is identical to the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" and it repeats as many times as the same word does in the entire sentence.

For example, ""wif"" is associated with red, and it occurs twice in the third input. So the output for ""walm"" in this context is ""red red."" In the fifth input, ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and it occurs three times, so the output for ""walm"" there is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:
Rule: The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color of the word directly before it as many times as that word appears in the entire input.",0.9,164,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine each example one by one and identify the pattern.

1. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   It seems ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"" at the end.

2. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow green,"" which removes the third ""yellow.""

3. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow 
   In this case, ""walm"" is followed by ""red red,"" twice removing each instance's third ""red.""

4. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   ""walm"" again corresponds to ""green green green"" at the end.

5. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   Here, ""walm"" corresponds to the ""yellow yellow yellow"" ending pattern.

From these examples, we can infer that ""walm"" refers to the repetition of the nearest preceding color three times. However, if that color is immediately preceded by its corresponding single-color word, the pattern reduces it by one instance, as was the case in examples 2 and 3.

Rule: walm -> the meaning of ""walm"" is to triplicate the nearest preceding color, but if that color's corresponding word is directly before ""walm,"" only duplicate the color.",0.8,164,walm
"Based on the examples given, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to multiple repetitions of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. To confirm this, we can examine how ""walm"" behaves in the various examples provided.

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"". Here ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and ""walm"" seems to repeat this color three times.
- In the second example, there's no instance immediately after ""walm,"" which could either challenge the hypothesis or possibly be an oversight in the example provided, as ""walm"" does not have a preceding term to determine its output.
- In the third example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and ""walm"" seems to repeat this color three times.
- The fourth example, ""dax walm,"" results in ""green green green."" Here ""dax"" is associated with the color green, and ""walm"" again repeats it three times.
- In the fifth example, ""zup walm"" concludes the series with ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" repeats it three times.

Another thing to note is that ""walm"" always results in three repetitions of the preceding color.

Therefore, the rule that can be induced is as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

Using this rule:

- If ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which equals red, then ""walm"" means ""red red red.""
- If ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which equals blue, then ""walm"" means ""blue blue blue.""
- If ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which equals green, then ""walm"" means ""green green green.""
- If ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which equals yellow, then ""walm"" means ""yellow yellow yellow.""",0.8,164,walm

"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in each example, regardless of its position or the surrounding words.",1.0,165,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" by looking at the consistent output whenever ""lug"" appears in the input. Let's break it down according to each input and its corresponding output:

- In the first example, each occurrence of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue.""
- The third example also has ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" once again matches up with ""blue"" in the output.
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" as well.

From these observations, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string or the other words around it.

Therefore the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,165,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in each example.",1.0,165,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the given input-output pairs and look for patterns that pertain specifically to the presence of ""dax.""

In every case where ""dax"" is present, the word ""green"" appears in the output. It appears as the first color in the output sequence every time ""dax"" is present in the input. This suggests that ""dax"" on its own translates to ""green.""

Additionally, it seems that ""dax"" might influence the output sequence further based on the context of the other words, but with the current examples, we are only focusing on the word ""dax"" itself.

Based on the above observations, the rule is as follows:

Rule: ""dax"" -> green

This rule applies regardless of the presence of other words in the sequence. Any time ""dax"" appears, you will always see ""green"" in the corresponding position of the output.
",1.0,165,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the patterns in the inputs and corresponding outputs:

1. When ""dax"" is the only word in the input, the output is ""green.""
2. When ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"", the output begins with ""green red.""
3. When ""dax"" is followed by ""wif walm,"" the output begins with ""green red"" and is followed by two additional ""red.""
4. When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm wif,"" the output is ""green"" three times, followed by ""red.""
5. When ""dax"" is in the middle of other words, ""zup"" and ""lug,"" the color corresponding to ""dax"" is still ""green.""

From these patterns, we can infer that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" The output color does not change regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that follow or precede it. Therefore, we can determine the following rule:

dax -> green. 

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs.",1.0,165,dax
"To decode the meaning of ""dax,"" we must look for patterns in the given examples. Let's examine the instances where ""dax"" appears and the corresponding output:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears alone, the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" appears before ""wif,"" the output starts with ""green red.""
- With ""dax wif walm,"" the output is ""green red red red,"" and with ""dax walm wif,"" the output is ""green green green red.""

From these examples, it seems that ""dax"" always corresponds to the output ""green."" It is consistent regardless of what follows. The subsequent words (""wif,"" ""walm,"" etc.) must have their own color assignments, since they also contribute to the output in a patterned way.

Thus, the rule appears to be: dax -> green.",1.0,165,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we need to derive the meaning of the word ""dax"". We can use the context in which ""dax"" appears to try and figure out what it stands for:

- When ""dax"" occurs alone (Example 2), the output is ""green"".
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"" (Example 1), the output is ""green red"".
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""wif walm"" (Example 3), the output is ""green red red red"".
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm wif"" (Example 4), the output is ""green green green red"".
- When ""dax"" is within a sequence that also includes ""zup"" and ""lug"" (Example 5), the output corresponding to ""dax"" is still ""green"".

Based on these observations, it seems that the output associated with ""dax"" is consistently ""green"". The presence of other words doesn't seem to change this output, indicating that ""dax"" directly translates to ""green"", regardless of the surrounding context.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,165,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" However, the context in which dax is used also influences the output of other words. For instance, ""wif"" following ""dax"" outputs ""red,"" but when it precedes ""dax,"" there is no ""red"" in the output. The word ""walm"" seems to output ""red"" when following ""dax"" or ""wif,"" but outputs ""green"" when it precedes ""dax."" The occurrence of ""zup"" generates ""yellow"" and ""lug"" generates ""blue,"" although their placement does not seem to affect the output color of ""dax.""

Considering the above, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""wif"" seems to translate to the color ""red."" Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.

The colors that the other words map to are consistent across all examples. Therefore, while ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" the other words may translate to a single color or a pattern involving repeat colors and ""red.""

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word or sequence of words corresponds to a specific color in the output. Considering each input and its corresponding output, the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" can be deduced from the consistent representation in color. Here's the breakdown:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears on its own or as the first word in a sequence, the output is ""yellow"".
- Every subsequent word or combination of words appears to correspond to another color.

For example:

- ""zup"" on its own results in ""yellow"".
- ""zup wif bluf"" makes ""yellow red red"", indicating that ""wif"" is likely ""red"" and ""bluf"" is also ""red"".
- ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red"", signifying that ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""bluf"" maintains as ""red"", and ""wif"" is ""red"" when it is at the end of a sequence.
- ""zup lug wif"" becomes ""yellow blue red"", reinforcing that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" at the end is ""red"".

From these examples, we can derive the following rule:

- ""lug"" always translates to ""blue,"" with the exception in the presence of another ""lug,"" in which case ""lug"" does not seem to affect the outcome directly since there is not enough context for its standalone meaning.

In each example where ""bluf"" is present, if we look at the color output immediately after ""bluf,""  we notice a pattern. ""bluf"" is followed by ""red"" in the first example, ""yellow"" in the second, ""yellow"" in the third but it also precedes a ""green"" in the fourth example, and in the fifth example, there's no word after bluf but it is followed by ""red.""

It seems that ""bluf"" may not correspond to a consistent color but perhaps to a rule concerning the color either immediately preceding or following it. Let's explore these possibilities:

1. When ""bluf"" follows another word, the color output is the same as the preceding color.
   - In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" the output is ""red.""
   - In the second example, there is no word before ""bluf.""

2. When ""bluf"" precedes another word, the color output matches the word that follows ""bluf.""
   - In the second example, ""wif"" follows ""bluf,"" and the color output after ""bluf"" is ""red,"" which matches ""wif.""
   - In the third example, ""zup"" follows ""bluf,"" and the color output after ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" matching ""zup.""
   - In the fourth example, ""zup"" follows ""bluf,"" and the color output after ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" matching ""zup.""
   - In the fifth example (wif bluf), there is no word after ""bluf,"" and the output is ""red"" which precedes bluf.

From this analysis, it appears that the word ""bluf"" is a rule that means to repeat the color of the next word if there is one. If there isn't a word after ""bluf"", then the color of the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" should be repeated.

"Rule: bluf -> blue when it immediately follows a color word; otherwise, bluf -> green.",0.6,165,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to act as a repetition signal for the color that immediately precedes it. Specifically, the word that comes before ""walm"" is associated with a color, and its output is that color repeated three times. Here's the breakdown:

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- The repetitions of colors in other examples also depend strictly on the word before ""walm"" and its associated color without being affected by other surrounding words.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,165,walm
"walm -> ""repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times""

Rule: When the word 'walm' appears in a sequence, it indicates that the color associated with the immediately preceding word should be repeated three times in the output.",1.0,165,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with repetition of the color that the previous word translates to:

- ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow,"" implying that ""walm"" means repeating the color associated with ""zup,"" which is yellow.
- ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue,"" implying that ""walm"" means repeating the color associated with ""lug,"" which is blue.
- In extended sequences, such as ""wif zup walm dax zup"", it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it, in this case, ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow.
- The repetition always seems to occur three times, as seen in all the examples.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color correlate of the preceding word three times.",1.0,165,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" refers to a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it, repeated three times. In each example, when ""walm"" follows a color word, that color word is then repeated three times in the output. Therefore, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.",1.0,165,walm
"From the examples given:

1. ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""zup"" may represent ""yellow.""
2. ""lug walm"" yields ""blue blue blue,"" so ""lug"" may represent ""blue.""
3. ""wif zup walm dax zup"" yields ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow,"" so ""wif"" may represent ""red,"" ""dax"" may represent ""green,"" and notice that ""zup walm"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow.""
4. ""dax zup walm wif"" yields ""green yellow yellow yellow red,"" so it's consistent with ""dax"" representing ""green,"" ""zup"" representing ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" representing ""red.""
5. ""zup walm lug"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" consistent with ""zup"" representing ""yellow"" and ""lug"" representing ""blue.""

Considering the word ""walm"" is central in all these examples, and always results in a repetition of the previous color word three times, we can deduce that ""walm"" likely signals repetition of the immediately preceding color word three times.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in this context. The rule can be inferred as follows:

- When the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue.""

So the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,166,lug
"Based on the examples and their corresponding outputs, the rule for 'lug' can be deduced as:

lug -> blue

Rule: The word 'lug' corresponds to the color blue in the outputs.",1.0,166,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce a rule for the meaning of ""dax."" Let's analyze the patterns:

1. When ""dax"" is mentioned once in an input, a single ""green"" appears in the output.
2. When ""dax"" appears at the start of the input sequence, ""green"" is the first word of the output.
3. When ""dax"" is repeated in an input sequence (""dax lug dax""), each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to an output of ""green.""
4. When ""dax"" is surrounded by other words (like in ""dax lug walm"" and ""wif bluf dax""), ""green"" always corresponds to the location of ""dax,"" while the other words seem to have their own color associations.
5. The position of ""dax"" in the sequence doesn't change the output associated with it; it is always ""green,"" irrespective of its position.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Other words appear to have their own color mappings that are consistent regardless of the presence of ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,166,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output. Other words in the inputs like ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and ""bluf"" transform to other colors in the outputs, and the transformation is consistent for each specific word. The word ""lug,"" for example, always maps to ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule for the word ""dax"" is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,166,dax

"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Every input that contains ""wif"" consistently outputs ""red"" in the same position.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,166,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. If we pair up each input with its corresponding output, we can try to find the pattern for the word ""wif"":

- In the first example, after being given the sequence ""zup lug bluf zup bluf,"" which corresponds to ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow,"" the addition of ""wif"" results in the output of ""red."" Since the other colors were already predetermined, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" is once again followed by ""red"" in the output, consistent with the other occurrences of ""wif.""
- In the third example, the single input ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the two-item output, confirming the association.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" similarly translates to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and when followed by ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""

- bluf -> blue
- zup -> yellow

Given this mapping, it seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,166,zup
zup -> yellow,1.0,166,zup

Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,166,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,166,zup
"Given the examples, let's try to deduce what the rule for ""bluf"" might be.

Analyzing the first example:
Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
Output: green green red yellow red
We can see that after ""bluf"" the color ""red"" appears, which corresponds to the word ""wif"".

Analyzing the second example:
Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
Here, after ""bluf"" the color ""green"" appears, corresponding to ""dax"".

Analyzing the third example:
Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
Output: red blue blue red yellow
After ""bluf"", we once again have ""red"", which correlates to ""wif"".

Analyzing the fourth example:
Input: zup wif bluf zup
Output: yellow red red yellow
After ""bluf"", ""yellow"" is repeated, corresponding to ""zup"".

Analyzing the last example:
Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
After each ""bluf"" we see that the following colors are green and blue, corresponding to ""dax"" and ""lug"".

Based on these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" might correspond to the repetition of the color that comes right after ""bluf"". So, if a word after ""bluf"" corresponds to a certain color, ""bluf"" results in the output being that color again.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word following ""bluf"".",1.0,166,bluf
"Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it.""

Explanation:
- In every example, whenever ""bluf"" appears, the output color is the same as the color that represents the word just before ""bluf"".
- For instance, in the first example, ""dax bluf wif zup wif"", ""dax"" is represented by ""green"", and the word immediately after ""bluf"" is also ""green"". Similarly, in all other examples, the color following ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that precedes ""bluf"".

So, we can articulate the meaning of ""bluf"" as follows:

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the word that precedes ""bluf"".",1.0,166,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" modifies the subsequent word by changing its associated color to the color before the modification happened. Here are the rules observed for each instance where ""bluf"" appears:

- In the first example, ""dax"" is associated with green. After ""bluf"", ""wif"" changes from its original red to green.
- In the second example, ""lug"" is associated with blue. After ""bluf"", ""dax"" changes from its original green to blue.
- In the third example, ""lug"" is associated with blue. After ""bluf"", ""wif"" changes from its original red to blue.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is associated with red. After ""bluf"", ""zup"" changes from its original yellow to red.
- In the fifth example, twice ""dax"" is associated with green. ""Bluf"" appears twice, and each time it is followed by ""lug"" and ""dax"" respectively, and both change from their original colors (blue for lug, green for dax) to yellow, which is the color of ""zup"" before them.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it causes the color of the next word to change to the color of the word preceding ""bluf"". We can formalize the rule as follows:

Rule: When ""bluf"" precedes a word, the color of that following word is changed to the color associated with the word immediately before ""bluf"".

Hence, the meaning is:

bluf -> causes the following word to take the color of the preceding word.",1.0,166,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. The word ""bluf"" seems to be a rule that instructs us to repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately after ""bluf.""

Rule: When ""bluf"" appears before a word, the color associated with the following word is repeated once in the output sequence. For instance, if ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to green, then the output will have ""green"" repeated once (""green green"").",1.0,166,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the given examples in relation to their outputs.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" and before ""wif,"" and the corresponding output is ""green red."" Observing that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""bluf"" must thus translate to ""green red"" in the sequence.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" translating to ""blue,"" and precedes ""dax,"" which translates to ""green."" The output after ""bluf"" is ""blue green,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" causes the output of the next word to repeat once before moving on to the next.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" (red), and the output sequence is ""blue red,"" supporting the idea that ""bluf"" again causes the next word's output to repeat.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which means red, and the next output is ""red yellow,"" indicating the repetition of ""red"" after ""bluf.""
- Finally, in the last example, ""bluf"" is between ""zup"" (yellow) and ""dax"" (green), and ""lug"" (blue) follows it. The output ""yellow blue"" after the first ""bluf"" and ""blue green"" after the second ""bluf"" further suggest that ""bluf"" causes the color of the next word to repeat.

Based on these observations, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be that it indicates the next color word should be repeated once before continuing with the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the subsequent word in the sequence once.",0.8,166,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word 'walm', we need to examine the relationships between the inputs and the corresponding outputs in the provided examples.

Let's consider each example:

1. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   Observation: When the first 'lug' appears, it maps to 'blue', the second 'lug' also maps to 'blue'. 'walm' after 'lug' results in additional 'blue'. 'dax' maps to 'green', and 'wif' maps to 'red'.

2. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   Observation: 'dax' maps to 'green', and following it, 'walm' leads to more 'green'. 'wif' maps to 'red'.

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Observation: 'dax' accompanied by 'walm' continues to result in 'green'.

4. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   Observation: 'zup' maps to 'yellow', 'lug' maps to 'blue', and the occurrence of 'walm' after 'lug' leads to additional instances of 'blue'. 'wif' appears to reset the pattern, mapping to 'red', and 'walm' following it leads to additional instances of 'red'.

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   Observation: 'wif' maps to 'red', and 'bluf' does not appear to affect the pattern as it still leads to 'red'. 'dax' maps to 'green', and 'walm' sequentially results in additional 'green'.

Based on these observations, we notice that 'walm' seems to extend the color code of the word that appears right before it. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: The nonce word 'walm' repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Let's frame it as per your instructions:

walm -> meaning. Rule: 'walm' causes the color of the preceding word to repeat.",1.0,166,walm
"Walm -> blue when it follows 'lug' and red when it follows 'wif'; otherwise, it is green.",1.0,166,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first look at the color sequence outputs in relation to the input that includes ""walm."" 

- In all instances where ""walm"" appears, the immediate word after ""walm"" that isn't itself ""walm"" gets an output of ""red."" This might suggest that ""walm"" affects the color assigned to the following word. 
- Every time ""walm"" is present, there are a series of ""green"" before the ""red"" output. The number of ""green"" outputs is equal to the number of occurrences of ""walm"" plus one.
- ""walm"" never receives its own color output, rather it changes the outputs of other words around it.

From these observations, we can infer the rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" makes the following non-""walm"" word turn red in the output, and it also generates an additional ""green"" per instance of ""walm"" seen before the next non-""walm"" word.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

walm -> Generates an output of ""green"" for itself and turns the next non-""walm"" word's output into ""red"".",0.9,166,walm
"From the examples given, it appears that ""walm"" affects the output by extending the color of the word that follows ""walm."" Specifically, it causes the next word to generate a sequence of colors starting with that word's own color followed by repetitions. We can induce this rule by examining the outputs given after ""walm"" and the colors that follow.

Let's look at each example:

1. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   Analysis: ""lug"" outputs blue, when followed by ""walm"", ""dax"" (which would normally output green) is repeated three times.

2. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   Analysis: ""dax"" outputs green, when followed by ""walm"", ""wif"" (which would normally output red) is repeated three times.

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Analysis: ""dax"" outputs green, when followed by ""walm"" there is a repetition of green, even though there is no word after ""walm"" to indicate which color should be repeated, so it repeats the color of ""dax"" itself.

4. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   Analysis: ""zup"" outputs yellow, ""lug"" outputs blue, when followed by ""walm"", ""wif"" (which would normally output red) is repeated once, presumably because ""walm"" occurs at the end, and the rule seems to propagate the preceding color three times.

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   Analysis: ""wif"" outputs red, ""bluf"" outputs red, ""dax"" outputs green, when followed by ""walm"", the green from ""dax"" is repeated two extra times.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is that it triggers the repetition of the color word that follows it, causing that color word to be represented three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the following word's color to repeat three times.

If ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence or immediately follows another ""walm,"" the preceding color seems to propagate. If ""walm"" comes after a non-color word, it defaults to the preceding color word's color. If ""walm"" is the very last word in a sequence, it may only trigger a single repetition of the last color word's output or might continue the pattern of three if there's a subsequent color word (as shown in the fourth example). The last example, however, does not fit perfectly with this rule since it does not explain the dual occurrence of red following ""bluf"". This inconsistency might suggest there are additional context-specific rules at play or possibly an error in the examples provided.",0.8,166,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's look at the patterns of input relative to the output colors.

1. Whenever ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is a sequence of three blues followed by a red ('blue blue blue red').
2. Whenever ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is three greens ('green green green').
3. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup lug,"" the output is two blues followed by two reds ('blue blue red red'). 
4. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it's preceded by a sequence of two colors repeated, but when it's ""wif bluf dax walm,"" it results in two reds followed by three greens ('red red green green green').

Given these patterns, it seems that ""walm"" translates to a repeating pattern that requires looking at both the preceding and following words to understand its complete effect. Specifically, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before it three times (""dax"" -> ""green green green"", ""lug"" -> ""blue blue blue"") and then includes an additional color based on a subsequent word, which in the context of the examples given, is often red.

Thus, the rule seems to be:
- Repeat the color associated with the word before ""walm"" three times.
- Then, follow that with a red color unless a subsequent word changes it (however, there's no clear pattern from the given examples as to what might change the follow-up color).

Hence, the rule for ""walm"" is:
walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times, followed by a red. (Note: The rule might be incomplete or subject to change with additional context or examples).",0.7,166,walm

"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green"". No matter the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the words that surround it, the output associated with ""dax"" remains the same.

The word ""dax"" consistently leads to the output ""green,"" regardless of what other words are present in the input. The consistency of this mapping across all examples suggests that the relationship is one-to-one and does not depend on context. Therefore, based on the information given, we can induce the following rule:

Rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,167,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""zup."" Let's observe the instances where ""zup"" is used and the corresponding output:

1. When ""zup"" follows ""walm"" which outputs ""green,"" the resulting output is a sequence of ""red"" followed by ""yellow.""
2. When ""zup"" follows ""lug"" which outputs ""blue,"" the resulting output is ""yellow.""
3. When ""zup"" is on its own or follows ""wif"" which outputs ""red,"" the resulting output is ""yellow.""
4. When ""zup"" follows ""dax"" which outputs ""green,"" the resulting output is ""yellow.""

From these observations, it seems that ""zup"" does not depend on what word it follows to determine its output color. In every case, regardless of the preceding word, ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule we can derive is:

zup -> yellow",1.0,167,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze each example step by step to identify patterns:

From the given examples:

1. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
2. Input: lug zup wif zup
   Output: blue yellow red yellow
3. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
4. Input: lug dax zup dax wif
   Output: blue green yellow green red
5. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow

Looking at examples 3 and 5, where the pattern is the simplest, we can notice:

- When we have ""dax zup,"" the output is ""green yellow.""
- When we have ""zup wif,"" the output is ""yellow red.""

It seems that ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

In example 2, ""lug zup wif zup"" corresponds to ""blue yellow red yellow,"" again reinforcing that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

In example 1, the sequence ends with ""zup"" and the color sequence responds with an additional ""yellow"" at the end after a series of ""green"" and ""red.""

The fourth example also aligns with the rule where ""zup"" is in the middle of the sequence, and it corresponds to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,167,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" we will need to look at the examples provided and find patterns. Let's observe each line:

2. Input: lug zup wif zup
   Output: blue yellow red yellow

3. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red

4. Input: lug dax zup dax wif
   Output: blue green yellow green red

5. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow

Now let's try to deduce the patterns:

- In the first example, ""zup"" appears at the end of the input, resulting in ""yellow"" at the end of the output, following the ""red red red.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" is flanked by ""lug"" and ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""blue"" and ""red,"" respectively, and both instances of ""zup"" translate to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""zup"" comes just before ""wif,"" and the output correspondingly has ""yellow"" just before ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and precedes another ""dax,"" with the output sequence being ""yellow"" after the first ""green"" and before the second ""green.""
- In the last example, ""zup"" comes just after ""dax,"" and the output has ""yellow"" just after ""green.""

From these observations, it seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,167,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine the patterns in the provided examples.

1. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   - Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" to ""red,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to the part of the pattern that shifts to the new color ""yellow"" after ""zup"" appears.

2. Input: lug zup wif zup

   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and notice here ""zup"" appears before ""wif,"" which results in ""yellow"" and ""red"" showing afterwards. When ""zup"" appears at the end, it corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. Input: lug dax zup dax wif
   Output: blue green yellow green red
   - ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and after ""zup,"" the pattern again includes ""yellow"" before continuing with the ""dax"" to ""green"" pattern and then ""wif"" as ""red.""

5. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow
   - ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" even without a following ""wif.""

From these observations, ""zup"" appears to change the subsequent color word to ""yellow,"" and if ""wif"" follows ""zup,"" the ""wif"" is translated to ""red."" Notably, when ""zup"" appears at the end of a sequence, or independently with another word, it solely correlates to ""yellow.""

"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to correlate with repeating the color of the word that immediately follows it three times. Here's the analysis of each example supporting this rule:

1. **Example 1:**
   Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   Analysis: ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" results in three ""yellow,"" which correspond to ""zup.""

2. **Example 2:**
   Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   Analysis: ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" results in three ""yellow,"" which correspond to ""zup.""

3. **Example 3:**
   Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""walm"" is directly followed by the end of the input, and results in three ""blue,"" which correspond to ""lug.""

4. **Example 4:**
   Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""walm"" is at the end of the input, so it repeats the color of the word that preceded it, ""lug"" which is ""blue.""

5. **Example 5:**
   Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""walm"" is at the end of the input, so it repeats the color of the word that preceded it, ""lug"" which is ""blue.""

Given these observations, the rule appears consistent across all examples:

**Rule:**
walm -> meaning. Meaning is that ""walm"" results in three occurrences of the color corresponding to the word that immediately follows it, or, when at the end, the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it.

**Example application of the rule:**
If the input were ""dax walm zup,"" the output would be ""green green green yellow,"" as ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color ""yellow."" If ""walm"" were at the end, such as in ""lug dax walm,"" the output would be ""blue green blue blue blue,"" since ""walm"" would result in three occurrences of the color corresponding to ""dax,"" which is ""green.""",1.0,167,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times. 

Based on the given examples, whenever the nonce word ""walm"" appears, it causes the output to repeat the color assigned to the word just before ""walm"" three times in a row.

Here's the breakdown for each example:

1. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red 
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so after seeing ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   - ""zup"" is yellow again, so after ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated three times. 

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue, which is repeated three times after ""walm"".

4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" is the word before ""walm"" and is associated with blue, leading to ""blue"" being repeated three times.

5. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" once more, with its corresponding color blue repeated three times.

Therefore:

walm -> repeat the color of the word before it three times.",1.0,167,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can infer a rule for the word ""walm"" as follows:

For each instance, the word ""walm"" appears to change the color output that comes immediately after it to three instances of ""blue."" It doesn't seem to affect the colors outputted before it, only those after it, until a new word is introduced. Here are the observations:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" which is normally associated with ""green,"" and then ""zup,"" which is normally associated with ""yellow."" Here, ""dax"" which would be ""green"" is replaced by three ""yellow""s which is the next ""zup"" after the ""dax.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" regularly triggers the output ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" we indeed see three instances of ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" simply leads to three ""blue""s with no colors before it to compare.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" normally outputs ""red,"" but after ""walm,"" ""lug"" produces three ""blue""s instead.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" typically outputs ""green,"" and ""lug"" outputs ""blue,"" but after ""walm,"" ""lug"" leads to three ""blue""s.

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" causes the color output that follows it to be three instances of ""blue"" until another word is read, at which point the pattern of colors resumes based on the rules for the next word.",1.0,167,walm
"Analyzing the examples provided, we can infer that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a specific rule or meaning related to the output color sequence. Here's what we can deduce from the examples:

1. Whenever ""walm"" is present, the output color that immediately follows ""walm"" is repeated three times.

Examples:
- zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow
- zup walm lug -> yellow yellow yellow
- lug walm -> blue blue blue
- wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
- wif dax lug walm -> red green blue blue blue

2. We can also observe that ""walm"" does not have a direct output color associated with it like the other words do (zup -> yellow, dax -> green, lug -> blue, wif -> red).

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output color of the word immediately following it to be repeated three times.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" can be described as:

walm -> Triggers a repetition of the next color in the sequence three times.",0.9,167,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the examples, let's look at the correlation between the input and output sequences provided.

1. The word ""walm"" appears in every input sequence. 
2. After each appearance of ""walm,"" the next few outputs, regardless of the following input word(s), are ""blue.""

This pattern is consistent in every example:

- After ""zup walm dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow green,"" yet the pattern immediately following ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- After ""zup walm lug wif bluf,"" the output sequence is ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red,"" indicating that after ""walm,"" the pattern changes to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- When the input is simply ""lug walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" everything after ""walm"" is ""blue.""
- Finally, for ""wif dax lug walm,"" the pattern following ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue.""

Thus, the appearance of ""walm"" generates a sequence of ""blue"" in the output. However, there is an additional detail to note: the number of times ""blue"" appears is equal to the number of words that follow ""walm."" If ""walm"" is the last word, there are no ""blue"" colors in the output.

Given the information above, it is reasonable to deduce the following:

Rule: walm -> When ""walm"" appears in the input, each word following it in the input will correspond to ""blue"" in the output up to the count of three. If there are no words after ""walm"" or more than three words follow, the ""blue"" sequence stops at three.",0.9,167,walm
"Given the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" correlates with the color ""blue"" in the outputs:

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

Input: wif lug wif
Output: red blue red

Input: lug wif
Output: blue red

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: wif zup bluf lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue

In each case, regardless of the words preceding or following ""lug,"" the corresponding output for ""lug"" is consistently ""blue."" Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,168,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,168,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,168,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's look for patterns in the input and output pairings:

- In the first example, ""wif walm lug"" translates to ""red red red blue"", suggesting that ""wif"" and ""walm"" might represent ""red,"" and ""lug"" represents ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""wif lug wif"" results in ""red blue red."" Since we already suspect ""wif"" might represent ""red,"" it reinforces the idea that ""lug"" could represent ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue red,"" which aligns with our previous assessment of ""lug"" representing ""blue"" and ""wif"" as ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue,"" here ""dax"" could represent ""green"" and ""lug"" seems to be ""blue"" again since it is surrounded by ""blue"" in the output. ""walm"" also seems to be ""blue,"" which might indicate it can take on more than one color depending on context, but ""lug"" remains consistent.
- The fifth example, ""wif zup bluf lug,"" results in ""red yellow yellow blue."" We haven't deduced ""zup"" and ""bluf"" before, but based on their outputs, they might represent ""yellow."" Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Considering the above examples, ""lug"" consistently correlates to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position or neighbors in the input string.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,168,lug
"To deduce the meaning or rule behind ""lug,"" let's examine the placement of ""lug"" and the corresponding output color in each example:

1. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
2. wif lug wif -> red blue red
3. lug wif -> blue red
4. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
5. wif zup bluf lug -> red yellow yellow blue

Based on these examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- When ""lug"" is present, the word following ""lug"" (if any) always maps to the color red, with one exception; when ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" it maps to blue instead. 
- When ""lug"" is the last word in the input, it maps to blue.
- When ""lug"" is the first word, it is followed by ""wif,"" and it maps to blue.
- ""Lug"" always appears to map to blue, except when influencing the color of the next word.

Combining these observations, we can infer:

Rule: ""Lug"" maps the following word to red, except for ""walm,"" which is mapped to blue. If ""lug"" is the last word or isn't followed by another word, it is mapped to blue. 

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

lug -> Change the next word's color to red (except for ""walm,"" which is blue), if ""lug"" is last or standalone, it is blue.",0.8,168,lug

1. Whenever ""zup"" appears alone, the output is consistently ""yellow.""
2. Whenever ""zup"" is included with other words, it also translates to ""yellow.""

Given the context of the examples provided, ""bluf"" seems to mean ""the same color as the previous word"". This rule is consistent across all examples, as the color mentioned after ""bluf"" is the same as the color corresponding to the word just before ""bluf"".

So, in each example:

- In ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" -> ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"", which outputs ""yellow"". So, ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow"" as well.
- In ""wif bluf"" -> ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"", which outputs ""red"". So, ""bluf"" outputs ""red"" as well.
- In ""lug bluf"" -> ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"", which outputs ""blue"". So, ""bluf"" outputs ""blue"" as well.
- In ""dax bluf"" -> ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"", which outputs ""green"". So, ""bluf"" outputs ""green"" as well.

Additionally, when ""bluf"" follows two different colors, it only seems to duplicate the color that directly precedes it:

- ""wif dax bluf"" leads to ""red green green"" (only ""dax"" is duplicated)

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the context in which the word is used and the output provided.

Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red

In these first two examples, regardless of the word that follows ""walm,"" the output for ""walm"" is consistent, indicating that ""walm"" likely maps to a single, consistent color.

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

In these examples, ""walm"" always maps to the output ""red"" no matter its position in the input sequence or the surrounding input words. Thus, the rule is not dependent on context.

Given all the examples, the rule for ""walm"" consistently maps to ""red"" in the output. Therefore:

Rule: walm -> red",1.0,168,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by looking at the patterns of inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Here are the observations from the given examples:

1. ""zup walm dax"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green""
2. ""zup walm wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow red""
3. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" results in ""green red red red blue yellow""
4. ""zup wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red""
5. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red""

From the input-output pairs, we can make the following observations:
- Whenever ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output for ""walm"" is ""yellow.""
- Whenever ""walm"" follows ""dax"" or ""wif,"" the output for ""walm"" is ""red.""
- ""Walm"" does not show any variation in outputs when being the last word or in other positions; it consistently triggers red unless it follows ""zup.""

Since ""zup"" modifies the outcome of ""walm"" to be ""yellow"" and all other instances result in ""walm"" being ""red,"" we can induce the following rule:

Walm -> If ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" then it outputs ""yellow."" In all other contexts, it outputs ""red.""

Rule: If the previous word is ""zup,"" then ""walm"" is yellow. Otherwise, ""walm"" is red.",1.0,168,walm
"To deduce the meaning or the rule behind the word ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs related to the presence of ""walm"" in the input, noticing the pattern that follows its inclusion.

Firstly, let's analyze the color outputs corresponding to ""walm"":

1. ""zup walm dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green""
2. ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red""
3. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow""
4. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
5. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""

Looking at these outputs, every time ""walm"" is present, a sequence of three reds appears, except if there's a ""dax"" after ""walm,"" causing the sequence to start with a green followed by reds.

Now let's observe the positions:

- When ""walm"" is second, as in the first and second examples, the word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" and the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
   - ""zup walm dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green"" - a sequence of yellows followed by the color for ""dax,"" which is green.
   - ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red"" - a sequence of yellows followed by the color for ""wif,"" which is red.

- When ""walm"" is placed elsewhere:
   - ""dax wif walm lug zup"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow"" - ""walm"" is followed by ""lug zup,"" which gets the colors ""blue yellow"" but maintains the sequence of reds after ""walm.""
   - ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red"" - ""zup"" gets its color ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" influences the sequence with its color ""red,"" and the sequence after ""walm"" continues with red.
   - ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red"" - ""wif"" has the color ""red,"" and the sequence following ""walm"" is only reds, as it ends there.

Based on this analysis, it appears that ""walm"" causes the following three elements to be colored red, unless the next word is ""dax,"" in which case the first color is green followed by reds for the remaining elements affected by ""walm."" Also, ""walm"" itself may or may not be represented as ""yellow,"" which could depend on the word before it (such as ""zup"" here); however, this is slightly speculation as there is no clear indication of what color ""walm"" represents independently.

Given this, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in an input, the output for the following three elements is ""red,"" unless the immediate next word is ""dax,"" then the output for the first element is ""green"" followed by ""red"" for the next two elements. If ""walm"" stands alone at the end without another word following which could be colored, then it seems to initiate three reds in the sequence even if there aren't enough words to follow through. The color ""yellow"" before ""walm"" may suggest its representation but is not conclusive without additional examples.",0.9,168,walm
"To deduce the meaning of 'walm', let's look at the outputs tied to its use and see if there is a consistent pattern.

Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green
- 'walm' here follows 'zup' and precedes 'dax'. 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', and 'dax' to 'green'.

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red
- Again, 'walm' follows 'zup' (which corresponds to 'yellow') and precedes 'wif' (which gives 'red' when it is followed by 'walm').

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow
- 'walm' here is preceded by 'wif' (which gives 'red' when followed by 'walm') and followed by 'lug', resulting in 'red'. 'zup' at the end gives 'yellow'.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- 'walm' succeeds 'wif' and is tied to 'red' again.

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- 'walm' follows 'wif', which again results in 'red'.

The pattern indicates that 'walm' must somehow influence or have a correlation with the color 'red' in the output, whenever it is present, regardless of its position in the sequence. Specifically, it seems that 'walm' turns the next output 'red' when it is not at the end of a sequence. However, if 'walm' is at the end of a sequence or when immediately preceded by 'zup', 'walm' is followed by the color 'yellow' instead of 'red'.

Rule: When 'walm' follows 'zup', the output color is 'yellow'. When 'walm' follows any other word (such as 'wif'), the color is 'red'. If 'walm' is the last word in the sequence, the color is 'red', except when it directly follows 'zup'. This indicates that 'walm' most likely means ""output red, unless directly following 'zup', in which case output yellow"".",0.8,168,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" modifies the color associated with the words that precede it. In each case where ""walm"" is present, every word before ""walm"" has its corresponding color turn to red (except when the word 'zup' precedes 'walm', then it's yellow). No words following ""walm"" have their colors changed in the output.

Here are the observed patterns:

- zup normally corresponds to yellow, but remains yellow even when followed by ""walm"".
- wif normally corresponds to red, and remains red when followed by ""walm"".
- dax normally corresponds to green, but changes to red when followed by ""walm"".

Using this pattern, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows a word, it changes that word's original color to red, unless that word is 'zup', which remains yellow.

Hence,

Rule: wif -> red,1.0,169,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,169,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by looking for patterns in the inputs and the corresponding outputs. Let's analyze each input and output pair:

1. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
   Output: red green red red yellow red

2. Input: dax wif zup
   Output: green red yellow

3. Input: lug wif lug wif lug
   Output: blue red blue red blue

4. Input: dax bluf wif zup
   Output: green green red yellow

5. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow

From these examples, we can observe that:
- ""dax"" consistently results in ""green"".
- ""bluf"" consistently results in ""green"" or ""red"" (in the case where it follows ""wif"").
- ""zup"" consistently results in ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue"".
- The word ""wif"" precedes colours that change dependent on what follows ""wif.""

For inputs where ""wif"" is followed by another instance of ""wif"" or the end of the sequence, we see ""red"" as the output consistently: 

- ""wif wif"" results in ""red red"".
- ""wif"" at the end results in ""red"".

For inputs with ""wif"" followed by a word that correlates to a color other than red (like ""lug"" -> ""blue"" or ""dax"" -> ""green""), ""wif"" results in ""red"":

- ""wif lug"" results in ""red blue"".
- ""wif dax"" results in ""red green"".

The difficulty is in the case ""wif bluf"", as ""bluf"" alone appears to map to ""green,"" but ""wif bluf"" in the first example maps to ""red red"". This could indicate that ""wif"" changes the output to ""red"" no matter the color that normally follows, but given it's unclear with ""bluf"" here, and we have only one instance of ""wif bluf"", it is hard to state a definitive rule for ""wif bluf"".

Given these observations, we can induce the most likely rule for ""wif"": it changes the color output to ""red"", regardless of the usual output for the word that follows it, with the exception of the word ""bluf"", where the pattern is uncertain due to limited data.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,169,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup"" in this context, let's analyze the patterns:

- Whenever ""zup"" is observed in an input, ""yellow"" is always part of the corresponding output.
- ""zup"" does not seem to affect the color outputs that correspond to other nonce words in the input sequence.

The following observations can be made:

- When ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting ""walm"" might be associated with two additional occurrences of ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""yellow blue,"" hence ""lug"" might be associated with ""blue.""
- When a sequence contains ""wif bluf lug zup,"" the output is ""red red blue yellow,"" even though ""wif"" alone typically corresponds to ""red.""
- When ""zup dax walm zup wif"" is provided, the output includes a triple ""green"" following the first ""yellow,"" possibly linked to ""dax walm,"" followed by another ""yellow"" for the second ""zup,"" and ending with ""red,"" which seems associated with ""wif.""
- When the input is just ""wif zup,"" the output is simply ""red yellow,"" straightforwardly corresponding to the assumed meanings of ""wif"" and ""zup.""

Given these patterns, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be that it corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Regardless of its position in the string or the nonce words around it, it consistently results in ""yellow"" being part of the output.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,169,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine the instances where it is used and the associated output:

- When ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""yellow blue.""
- When ""zup"" is preceded by ""wif bluf lug,"" the output is ""red red blue yellow.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""dax walm zup wif,"" the output is ""yellow green green green yellow red.""
- When ""zup"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is ""red yellow.""

In each case, the presence of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output. It appears that ""zup"" translates directly to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the series of words.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"".",1.0,169,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we observe that when the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the output consistently includes the color ""yellow."" The position of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to the position of ""yellow"" in the output. Thus, we can conclude that the nonce word ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,169,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup."" Let's examine each example and its output to find the underlying rule.

1. Input: ""zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   Observation: The word ""walm"" corresponds to two more instances of ""yellow"" following ""zup.""

2. Input: ""zup lug""
   Output: ""yellow blue""
   Observation: The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" at the beginning.

3. Input: ""wif bluf lug zup""
   Output: ""red red blue yellow""
   Observation: ""wif"" and ""bluf"" translate to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and at the end, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" again.

4. Input: ""zup dax walm zup wif""
   Output: ""yellow green green green yellow red""
   Observation: Here, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" at the beginning and before ""wif,"" ""dax"" translates to the first ""green,"" and ""walm"" after ""dax"" corresponds to two additional ""green.""

5. Input: ""wif zup""
   Output: ""red yellow""
   Observation: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

From the examples provided, we can deduce that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" every time it appears. Whether at the beginning, middle, or end of the sequence, it still corresponds to ""yellow."" It does not appear to affect or be affected by the surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,169,zup
"Based on the examples provided:

- ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red""
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red""
- ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue yellow red red green""
- ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue""
- ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red""

It appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the word ""red"" since every time ""bluf"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""red"" is present in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> red",1.0,169,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a color, and every instance of ""bluf"" results in the output ""red red."" If we assume that each word is directly mapped to one or two color outputs, we can make the following associations:

- ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" maps to ""red""
- ""dax"" maps to ""green""
- ""lug"" maps to ""blue""

Given that ""bluf"" consistently results in ""red red,"" regardless of the words around it, we can infer that ""bluf"" always corresponds to this pair of colors.

Rule: bluf -> ""red red""",1.0,169,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the correlation between the nonce word ""bluf"" and the outputs.

- When bluf follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow red red.""
- When bluf follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
- When bluf is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""wif,"" the output is ""green red red.""
- When bluf is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
- When bluf is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green red red.""

It appears that bluf consistently corresponds to ""red red"" in the output regardless of its position in the input or the preceding word. All examples that include ""bluf"" end with ""red red"" in the output. Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to be associated with ""red red.""

Since the output colors correspond to words before ""bluf"" as well, we can deduce that other non-bluf words might code for the first color in the output string. For instance, ""zup"" precedes ""yellow,"" ""lug"" precedes ""blue,"" and ""dax"" precedes ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> red red",1.0,169,bluf
"Observing the given examples, we see that each word in the input maps to a color in the output:

- ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" maps to ""red""
- ""dax"" maps to ""green""
- ""lug"" maps to ""blue""

The word ""bluf"" follows each word and results in the word being repeated in the output:

- ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red"" (The word ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and ""red"" is repeated)
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" (The word ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and ""red"" is repeated)
- ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue yellow red red green"" (The word ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and ""red"" is repeated)

- ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red"" (The word ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and ""red"" is repeated)

The rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that when it follows a word, that word's corresponding color in the output is repeated. Therefore:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a word, the color associated with that word is repeated in the output.",1.0,169,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

When ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow red red."" The ""yellow"" corresponds to ""zup,"" while the ""red red"" corresponds to ""bluf."" This is consistent even when other words are present in the sequence.

However, when ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" the output is simply ""red red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""red red,"" regardless of the word ""wif.""

Furthermore, when ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue."" In this case, the first ""blue"" corresponds to ""lug,"" while the second ""blue"" might be attributed to ""bluf"" or it could mean that ""bluf"" is simply repeated twice.

Finally, when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output sequence ends with ""red red,"" again consistent with ""bluf"" being ""red red.""

Therefore, based on the above observations, we deduce that ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""red red,"" regardless of the preceding word.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds directly to a color, which is repeated to match the repetition of the nonce word ""bluf"" or preceding word. In each instance, the word ""bluf"" translates specifically to the color red, except when it follows ""lug"" where it translates to the color blue. 

Here's the breakdown for the given examples:

Example 1: ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf""
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to red
- ""bluf"" following ""wif"" corresponds to red
- ""dax"" corresponds to green
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue again
- ""bluf"" following ""lug"" corresponds to blue

Example 2: ""lug bluf""
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
- ""bluf"" following ""lug"" again corresponds to blue.

Example 3: ""dax walm wif bluf""
- ""dax"" corresponds to green
- ""walm"" is likely an error and should be ""wif"" since there's no information on the color ""walm"" corresponds to, so assuming ""wif"" corresponds to red
- ""bluf"" following ""wif"" corresponds to red

Example 4: ""lug bluf"" is the same as Example 2.

Example 5: ""zup bluf""
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
- ""bluf"" does not follow its usual pattern here, instead it corresponds to yellow.

The incongruity in these examples suggests that ""bluf"" may not have a fixed meaning on its own, but its meaning may depend on the word it immediately follows.

However, observing all examples, ""bluf"" always matches the color of the word that precedes it, rather than having an inherent color meaning.

Rule:
bluf -> The color of the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"". If ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" it's blue, if it follows ""dax"" it's green, if it follows ""zup"" it's yellow, and if it follows ""wif"" it's red. ""Bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word in the output.",0.8,170,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red when preceded by wif, otherwise bluf -> blue.",0.8,170,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at what output corresponds to its use in different input sequences. 

In the first example, ""walm"" appears after ""zup dax"" and the output for those three words is ""yellow green green."" Since we see that ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow"", it would seem that ""dax walm"" correlates to ""green green"".

In the second example, ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence ""zup walm"" and the output is ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup.""

In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the outputs for those two words are ""blue blue,"" which suggests that whenever ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" its output is ""blue.""

The fourth example complicates things a little since ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" and before ""lug."" The entire sequence ""zup walm lug"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which may suggest ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" again following ""zup."" However, it's important to notice that ""lug"" on its own correlates to ""blue,"" so the sequence of ""walm lug"" might be turning everything into ""yellow.""

The fifth example has ""walm"" following ""wif"" with an output of ""red red,"" suggesting a relationship to ""red.""

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" has a chameleon-like behavior, wherein its output color changes depending on the word that precedes it. Specifically, ""walm"" takes the color of the word before it in the sequence.

Rule: The word ""walm"" takes on the output color of the word that directly precedes it.

Example deduction:
Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red
""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green,"" thus ""walm"" is ""green.""

Applying the rule to the given examples:

1. zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green green green yellow red (""dax"" is green, ""walm"" becomes green)
2. wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow (""zup"" is yellow, ""walm"" becomes yellow)
3. zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green (""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" becomes blue)
4. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red (""zup"" is yellow, ""walm"" becomes yellow)
5. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red (""wif"" is red, ""walm"" becomes red)

Therefore:

walm -> The word ""walm"" changes its output color to match the color output of the word that directly precedes it.",1.0,170,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's consider the input and output patterns, looking for a correspondence between the presence of ""walm"" in the input and the colors in the output:

1. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   - Walm follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup"" and produces ""green."" 

2. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   - Walm is at the end of the sequence, following ""zup,"" and produces ""yellow.""

3. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   - Walm follows ""lug"" and precedes ""wif"" and produces ""blue.""

4. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   - Walm follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug"" and produces ""yellow.""

5. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   - Walm follows ""wif"" and is at the end, producing ""red.""

We can observe that ""walm"" changes its color output based on the words that come immediately before and after it. Let's try to deduce a pattern based on the surrounding words:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is yellow.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is blue.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red.
  
Also considering the position with respect to ""walm"" doesn't seem to change the output, we could deduce that the immediate preceding word determines the color associated with ""walm.""

Rule: The meaning of ""walm"" depends on the preceding word. If ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it means yellow; if it follows ""dax,"" it means green; if it follows ""lug,"" it means blue; and if it follows ""wif,"" it means red.",0.8,170,walm
"Analyzing the given examples and the corresponding outputs, we can attempt to identify patterns associated with the word ""walm."" We will look at each instance of ""walm"" and its position relative to the other inputs and respective outputs to induce the meaning or the rule behind it.

Example 1:
Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red
Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to green and precedes ""zup"" corresponding to yellow.

Example 2:
Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
In this example, ""walm"" is at the end, and ""zup"" before it corresponds to yellow. There is no word after ""walm"" to directly relate its output to.

Example 3:
Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to blue and precedes ""wif"" corresponding to red.

Example 4:
Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
""Walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and precedes ""lug"" (blue).

Example 5:
Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red
Again, ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, after ""wif"" (red), and there are no words after ""walm"" to compare.

From these examples, we can notice a pattern where ""walm"" seems to take on the color of the word that immediately precedes it (if any), regardless of what comes after. When ""walm"" is at the end of a sequence, it takes on the color of the word that preceded it, since there is no following word. 

Rule:
walm -> the same color as the preceding word (if any), else no specific rule is observed for the terminal position.",0.8,170,walm
"To deduce the rule for ""walm,"" let's look at the word's position in relation to the colors in the output:

1. zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green green green yellow red
   Here ""walm"" corresponds to the first ""green"" after a ""yellow"" and ""green"" sequence.

2. wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   ""Walm"" corresponds to the first ""yellow"" after a ""red,"" ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""yellow"" sequence.

3. zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green
   ""Walm"" corresponds to the second ""blue"" after a ""yellow"" and ""blue"" sequence.

4. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   ""Walm"" corresponds to the second and third ""yellow"" after a single ""yellow.""

5. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red
   ""Walm"" corresponds to the first and second ""red"" after ""green,"" ""blue,"" and ""red.""

Rule:
""walm"" appears to code for a repetition of the color that directly precedes it. If we match each ""walm"" with the color that comes right before it in output, we can establish that ""walm"" means repeat the previous color given.

Therefore, the rule can be defined as follows:
walm -> repeat the previous color.",0.8,170,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in each example that correlate with the color output. Let's analyze the input and output pairs:

1. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   - Here ""walm"" is associated with ""green"".

2. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   - Here ""walm"" is associated with ""yellow"".

3. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   - Here ""walm"" is associated with ""blue"".

4. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   - Here ""walm"" is associated with ""yellow"".

5. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   - Here ""walm"" is associated with ""red"".

Looking at these examples, ""walm"" seems to be taking on the color value of the word immediately preceding it. To confirm this pattern, we should see if ""walm"" takes the color of the word before it in each case:

1. ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green -> green)
2. ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow -> yellow)
3. ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue -> blue)
4. ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (yellow -> yellow), but there is a potential discrepancy here with ""lug wif"" (blue red) being followed by ""walm lug"" (yellow blue). This could be an inconsistency or indicate a different rule when multiple words are involved.
5. ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red -> red)

Except for the potential discrepancy in the fourth example, the rule mostly holds. However, as there is an inconsistency that might suggest a different rule when more words are involved, we should consider this a tentative rule and acknowledge the possible need for additional information to refine it.

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,171,dax
"Based on the examples provided, dax appears to be associated with the color green. This is consistent across all instances. However, the presence of other words also affects the output, with those words being associated with specific colors that are outputted before or after the occurrence of dax in the sequence. Here's the interpretation:

- wif -> red
- walm -> green green green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Now, let's verify the rule with each input-output pair:

1. Input: dax wif 
   Output: green red 
   Rule: dax translated to green, followed by wif which translates to red.

2. Input: dax walm 
   Output: green green green 
   Rule: dax translated to green, followed by walm which translates to green green green.

3. Input: zup lug walm wif dax 
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green 
   Rule: zup translated to yellow, followed by lug (blue), then walm (green green green), followed by wif (red), and finally dax (green).

4. Input: dax lug 
   Output: green blue 
   Rule: dax translated to green, followed by lug which translates to blue.

5. Input: wif dax wif 
   Output: red green red 
   Rule: wif translated to red, followed by dax (green), and then another wif (red).

Given these consistent mappings, the rule is that dax is directly translated to the color green no matter the context in which it appears.

The rule induction for dax is:

dax -> green",1.0,171,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" each time it appears. The other words must correspond to other colors, as we can see from their consistent association with the same outputs in different inputs. Here is the analysis:

- wif -> red
- walm -> green (repeated three times for ""walm walm walm"")
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,171,dax
"From the examples provided, we can observe that the output consists of color words, and each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. By examining the input-output pairs, we can try to determine the meaning or rule behind the word ""dax.""

Here's the breakdown of the examples provided:

1. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
   - Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""green green green"" or simply ""green"" repeated three times.

3. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" has been established to correspond to ""green"" repeated three times, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" at the end corresponds to ""green.""

4. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

5. Input: wif dax wif
   Output: red green red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" again to ""red.""

With these observations, we can see that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, we can deduce the rule for ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,171,dax
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output. In each example, wherever the word ""wif"" appears, the output contains ""red"" in the corresponding position.

Write the rule like this: wif -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,171,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" appears to correspond to the color ""red"" in the output. This correlation is consistent throughout all examples provided, as ""wif"" is always translated into ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,171,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" In each instance where ""wif"" is mentioned, ""red"" appears in the output at the same position. This is true regardless of the other words present or their order. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,171,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" is consistently translated into the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. This can be seen in each instance where ""wif"" appears:

1. ""zup wif zup"" corresponds to ""yellow red yellow"" – ""wif"" is in the middle of two ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow.""
2. ""dax lug wif lug"" corresponds to ""green blue red blue"" – ""wif"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" and precedes another ""lug.""
3. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" corresponds to ""blue red green green red blue"" – ""wif"" is found after a ""lug"" and before a ""dax,"" both times translated as ""red.""
4. ""wif bluf lug"" corresponds to ""red red blue"" – ""wif"" precedes ""bluf.""
5. A solitary ""wif"" is simply translated as ""red.""

The consistent translation allows the conclusion that the nonce word ""wif"" has a specific meaning, irrespective of the surrounding words:

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,171,wif
"Analyzing the given examples:

Input: zup wif zup
Output: yellow red yellow
Rule observed: ""wif"" is in the middle and corresponds to the color red. The colors before and after ""wif"" are the same, which are represented by the word ""zup.""

Input: dax lug wif lug
Output: green blue red blue
Rule observed: ""wif"" corresponds to red, flanked by the same word ""lug,"" which is represented by the color blue before and after ""wif.""

Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
Output: blue red green green red blue
Rule observed: ""wif"" again corresponds to red, both times it appears. The words on either side of ""wif"" correspond to different colors.

Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue
Rule observed: ""wif"" at the beginning of the sequence still corresponds to red, followed by ""bluf,"" which corresponds to red, and ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue.

Input: wif
Output: red
Rule observed: Even when ""wif"" stands alone, it corresponds to red.

Based on the observations, the rule for ""wif"" seems consistent regardless of context. In every instance, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,171,wif
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,171,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Yellow is the constant color output each time the word ""zup"" is used, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present.",1.0,171,zup
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow."" Therefore, we can deduce that the rule for ""zup"" is a direct translation to the color yellow, independent of context. We can write this rule as:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,171,zup
"To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""zup,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs to find a pattern.

- In every instance where ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" is outputted.
- ""Zup"" does not appear to modify the words around it; regardless of what words precede or follow ""zup,"" the output for ""zup"" remains consistently ""yellow.""
- There is no change in the output pattern that correlates with the position of ""zup"" within the sequence; whether it's at the beginning, middle, or end, the output is unchanged.

Given these observations, the rule for ""zup"" appears to be straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,171,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule is: zup -> yellow.",1.0,171,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe the following pattern:

1. In the first example, ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red"". Here, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".
2. The second example, ""wif lug zup bluf"", gives us ""red blue yellow yellow"". Again, ""bluf"" appears to correspond to ""yellow"".
3. In the third example, ""dax bluf wif zup"", we get ""green green red yellow"". This time, ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""green"".
4. The fourth example, ""wif bluf"", translates into ""red red"", with ""bluf"" aligning with ""red"" once more.
5. The fifth example, which is the same as the first, reconfirms the initial observation.

Given that ""bluf"" is translating to different colors depending on the context, the rule for ""bluf"" does not seem tied to a specific color. Instead, it appears to mirror the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word before it.",1.0,171,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can observe the following:

- When ""bluf"" appears after ""lug wif"", the output is ""blue red red"".
- When ""wif lug zup bluf"" is input, the output is ""red blue yellow yellow"".
- For the input ""dax bluf wif zup"", the output is ""green green red yellow"".
- The input ""wif bluf"" corresponds to the output ""red red"".
- Again, ""lug wif bluf"" leads to ""blue red red"" as an output.

We can deduce that:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", provided it precedes ""wif"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Focusing solely on the instances of ""bluf"", it seems that ""bluf"" leads to the repetition of the color word that directly precedes it. Considering the outputs where ""bluf"" is present, the color word that precedes ""bluf"" in the input is repeated twice in the output.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeat the preceding color word in the output.",1.0,171,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> the color that corresponds to the previously mentioned color in the sequence. 

In this case, when the word 'bluf' occurs, the color that is outputted is the same as the color that corresponds to the immediately preceding word. For example, 'wif' corresponds to 'red,' so when 'bluf' follows 'wif,' the output is 'red.' Similarly, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue,' so when 'bluf' follows 'lug,' the output is 'blue.' Thus, 'bluf' means 'repeat the previous color.'",1.0,171,bluf
"From the provided examples, we can deduce a pattern that allows us to infer the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" Let's examine the examples and outputs in parallel:

1. lug wif bluf      -> blue red red
2. wif lug zup bluf  -> red blue yellow yellow
3. dax bluf wif zup  -> green green red yellow
4. wif bluf          -> red red
5. lug wif bluf      -> blue red red

When looking at these examples and their corresponding outputs, we notice that the word ""bluf"" correlates with the duplication of the color that precedes it:

- In the 1st and 5th examples, ""bluf"" comes after ""lug wif,"" and the output is ""blue red red,"" where ""red"" is duplicated.
- In the 2nd example, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow,"" duplicating ""yellow.""
- In the 3rd example, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green,"" duplicating ""green.""
- In the 4th example, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" with no other words following, and ""red"" is the output, which gets duplicated to ""red red.""

Therefore, based on the patterns observed in these examples, the rule for the word ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeat the color word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,171,bluf
"Given the examples provided, we can deduce the following rules for each word:

- wif appears to correspond with red, given that every time ""wif"" is mentioned, the word ""red"" appears in the output.
- lug appears to correspond with blue, given that every time ""lug"" is mentioned, the word ""blue"" appears in the output.
- zup appears to correspond with yellow, given that every time ""zup"" is mentioned, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- dax appears to correspond with green, given that the instances of ""dax"" correlate with ""green"" in the output.

Given that ""bluf"" always appears twice in the output regardless of where it appears in the input (except in the one case where it appears only once in the input and output), we can deduce that ""bluf"" corresponds to the word that immediately precedes it in the output sequence, effectively repeating it.

Now, let's take a look at the given examples to extract the rule:

1. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   Here, ""bluf"" means ""red,"" which is the color associated with the word that precedes it: ""wif.""

2. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow
   Here, ""bluf"" means ""yellow,"" which is the color associated with the word that precedes it: ""zup.""

3. Input: dax bluf wif zup
   Output: green green red yellow
   Here, ""bluf"" means ""green,"" which is the color associated with the word that precedes it: ""dax.""

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   Here, ""bluf"" means ""red,"" which is the color associated with the word that precedes it: ""wif.""

5. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   Here, again, ""bluf"" means ""red,"" which is the color associated with the word that precedes it: ""wif.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,172,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,172,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer that each unique nonce word translates to a specific color. Specifically:

- ""zup"" always precedes ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" always precedes ""yellow"" when followed by ""wif"", otherwise it is ""blue""
- ""lug"" always translates to ""blue""
- ""dax"" always translates to ""green""
- ""wif"" appears to be a marker that switches the color indicated by ""bluf"" from ""blue"" to ""yellow""

Noting this pattern, it's evident that ""wif"" has a direct impact on the output color associated with ""bluf"". However, it also produces an output on its own:

- When ""wif"" is present by itself, the output is ""red""
- When ""wif"" is present in any sequence without ""bluf"", it translates to ""red""

Given that ""wif"" independently produces ""red"" when standing alone and seems to modify ""bluf"" to produce ""yellow"", we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" means ""red"" when it stands alone, and it indicates a change for ""bluf"" to translate to ""yellow"" when in sequence.",1.0,172,wif

- The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""

Focusing specifically on the nonce word ""wif,"" we observe:

- When ""wif"" is used after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow red.""

- In the context where ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is used directly before ""lug,"" the output sequence is ""red blue.""
- When ""wif"" is used with other words, the sequence always contains ""red"" in the position following ""wif.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" correlates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence. However, it does not appear to alter the color interpretation of other words around it, as they maintain their associated colors.

"Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Each occurrence of the word ""zup"" results in one instance of the color ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,172,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""zup"" adds the color ""yellow"" to the sequence, once for every time it appears. Additionally, other nonce words such as ""walm,"" ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" and ""lug"" correspond to different colors. These colors are consistently represented in the output (for example, ""walm"" is always followed by three ""red,"" ""dax"" is followed by ""green,"" and so on). Therefore, the meaning of ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: ""zup"" -> the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output sequence for each occurrence.",1.0,172,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" results in a repeated ""yellow"" for each syllable that follows it in the input. Here’s how we can see that:

- ""walm"" is a one-syllable word, and when preceded by ""zup"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"" (a threefold repetition of ""yellow"").
- ""dax"" is also a one-syllable word, and when it is preceded by ""zup"", the output is ""yellow green"" (with ""yellow"" appearing once because ""dax"" has one syllable).
- In the case of ""wif walm zup walm"", ""walm"" is again followed by three ""yellow"", which aligns with the first example.
- ""bluf dax"" after ""zup"" results in ""yellow yellow green"", which suggests that ""bluf"" being a one-syllable word gives one ""yellow"" and ""dax"" follows the same pattern as the second example.
- ""lug zup"" results in ""blue yellow"", but since ""zup"" does not have a word after it to determine the number of repetitions, it is consistent with a single instance of ""yellow"".

Based on these observations, the rule for ""zup"" could be:

Rule: ""zup"" means to output ""yellow"" for each syllable in the subsequent word, with no occurrence of ""yellow"" if there is no word following ""zup"".

However, it's important to point out a limitation in the examples: there is no input with ""zup"" followed by a word with more than one syllable to confirm how ""zup"" would behave in those cases. If ""zup"" requires another word following it to determine its output, that context is not shown. Thus, this rule is based on the currently available data.",0.9,172,zup
"The rule seems to be that ""zup"" means ""repeat the color word that corresponds to the last color word mentioned, one time less than it was previously mentioned."" Let us examine the evidence:

1. ""zup walm""
- The color ""yellow"" is mentioned three times. The pattern suggests that ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" initially but does not need to be repeated since no color word was mentioned before it.

2. ""zup dax""
- ""Dax"" is probably ""green,"" and since it follows ""zup,"" only ""yellow green"" is output, which follows the rule that ""zup"" repeats the last color minus one repetition.

3. ""wif walm zup walm""
- ""Wif"" leads to ""red red red,"" and the first ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" three times, as per the sequence in the first input example. ""Zup walm"" then follows the rule, repeating ""yellow"" two times after ""zup"" rather than three.

4. ""zup bluf dax""
- It's unknown what ""bluf"" corresponds to, but it doesn't affect the ""zup"" rule directly. ""Dax"" repeats as ""green,"" and ""zup"" again causes the last color word (""yellow"") to repeat one less time, leading to ""yellow yellow green.""

5. ""lug zup""
- ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and then ""zup"" follows, meaning ""yellow"" should follow ""blue,"" according to the rule.

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" is: Repeat the last mentioned color word exactly one time less than it was previously mentioned.

Rule: zup -> Repeat the last mentioned color word one time less than it was previously mentioned.",0.8,172,zup

Rule: bluf -> green.",1.0,172,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in the correspondence between the input phrases and their associated output colors. Comparing the inputs and outputs where ""bluf"" appears, we can try to determine the rule it follows:

- ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green""
- ""lug bluf dax bluf"" -> ""blue blue green green""
- ""dax lug wif bluf"" -> ""green blue red red""
- ""wif zup dax bluf"" -> ""red yellow green green""
- ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" -> ""red yellow yellow red green""

Looking at the first and second examples, when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output color is ""green."" In the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" is also followed by the color ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif."" The final example shows ""bluf"" producing ""yellow,"" which is the output that corresponds to ""zup"" just before it.

Considering the above observations, it seems that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it outputs a color that matches the output color of the word before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the output color of the preceding word.",1.0,172,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to first note the outputs associated with each instance of ""bluf"" and identify any patterns that might connect those instances to a specific meaning or rule. These patterns may be based on position, surrounding words, or repetition.

Based on the given examples, we can see that ""bluf"" always corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output:

1. Input: zup dax bluf | Output: yellow green green
2. Input: lug bluf dax bluf | Output: blue blue green green
3. Input: dax lug wif bluf | Output: green blue red red
4. Input: wif zup dax bluf | Output: red yellow green green
5. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax | Output: red yellow yellow red green

Looking at these, regardless of the position of ""bluf"" in the input sequence or the words around it, ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" in the output sequence. There doesn't seem to be any deviation or conditional influence based on context. 

Thus, the rule we can induce from these examples is:

Rule: bluf -> green",1.0,172,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red when it follows wif, green when it follows zup or dax, yellow when it follows bluf directly.",0.0,172,bluf
"From the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond with the color ""green"" repeatedly, regardless of its position in input. Every time ""walm"" is present in the input, ""green"" appears three times in the output. Therefore, based on this consistent pattern, the rule can be determined as follows:

Rule: walm -> green green green",1.0,172,walm
"Considering the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond to the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here’s how that works out:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to green. ""Dax walm"" means the color green is repeated three times.
- In the second and fourth examples, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"", resulting in three yellows, suggesting ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- In the third example, ""dax walm"" follows ""lug zup"", with ""lug"" producing blue, ""zup"" producing yellow, and ""dax walm"" producing three greens, once again following the pattern of repetition for ""dax"".
- In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" follows this pattern as well, with ""wif"" presumably corresponding to red and the repeated use indicating three reds before moving on to the colors associated with ""dax"" and ""zup"".

Based on this, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.",1.0,172,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the inputs and their respective outputs to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""walm.""

- Every instance of ""walm"" corresponds to three repeats of a color in the output.
- The color appears to be directly associated with the word that is preceding ""walm"" in the input.
- The colors follow a specific pattern based on the word right before ""walm"":
  - ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green""
  - ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow""
  - ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red""
  - There is no direct output for ""lug walm,"" but ""lug"" on its own corresponds to ""blue,"" hence it might be assumed ""lug walm"" would yield ""blue blue blue.""

Considering these patterns, we can formulate the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Using this rule:
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
- ""lug walm"" (not provided, but assumed based on pattern) -> ""blue blue blue""",1.0,172,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Each example leads to a repeated color output which corresponds to the word that follows ""walm."" When ""walm"" is used, the color for the subsequent word is repeated three times unless the subsequent word is ""bluf,"" in which case red is repeated five times. We can deduce the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""bluf,"" which comes after ""walm,"" uniquely corresponds to red repeated two additional times, for a total of five times.

Therefore, we can say that the rule is: When ""walm"" follows a word, the color associated with that word is repeated three times. If the subsequent word is ""bluf"", then the color red associated with ""bluf"" is repeated five times instead of three.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the next word three times, except for ""bluf,"" which leads to repeating red five times.",0.9,172,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns associated with each output:

- When ""dax"" appears before ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green red red.""
- When ""zup"" appears before ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug zup dax,"" the output includes ""green"" after the ""dax"" and continues with an additional ""green"" before turning to ""blue yellow.""
- When ""wif"" appears before ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red.""

It seems that ""walm"" modifies the color word that it follows to produce a series of three like colors. The color that ""walm"" produces is determined by the word that comes just before it. 

From these examples, we can infer:

- ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green.""
- ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" correlates with the color ""blue,"" but it doesn’t occur directly before ""walm"" in any of the examples, so its influence on ""walm"" can't be determined. However, ""lug"" does not alter the effect of ""walm"" which in its presence still results in three ""green"" corresponding to ""dax.""
- ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red.""

Given these observations, we can deduce the rule for the meaning of ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes the next three sections of the output to be the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.
So, 
walm -> meaning: causes the next three outputs to match the color of the preceding word.",0.8,172,walm

"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each instance of ""lug"" in the input leads to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the other words present. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""lug"" can be stated as follows:

5. In the fifth example, ""wif"" is again followed by ""red.""

Across all examples, irrespective of what precedes ""wif,"" it is consistently translated to ""red."" Therefore, we can induce that ""wif"" means ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,173,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is used in an input, the output includes the word ""red."" Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" seems to be consistent and independent of the context of the other words present.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,173,wif

Here, ""wif"" follows ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue"", and the output after ""wif"" is ""red"".

Again, ""wif"" comes after ""zup"" (yellow) and the output is ""red"".

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red
In this example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", and since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", the output following ""wif"" is also ""red"".

Input: dax lug wif
Output: green blue red
Here, ""wif"" comes after ""lug"" (blue) and the output is ""red"".

Input: dax zup lug wif lug
Output: green yellow blue red blue
Again, after ""wif"" appears in the input, its corresponding output is ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,173,wif
"Given the provided examples, we can observe the following:

- In the first example, the pattern ""lug wif lug"" results in ""blue red blue"". Since ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" both before and after ""wif"", it's likely that ""wif"" translates to ""red"".

- The second example strengthens this observation, as ""lug zup wif"" turns into ""blue yellow red"" where ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""wif"" appears to be ""red"" again at the end.

- The third example has ""lug wif bluf"" becoming ""blue red red"". Since ""lug"" is consistently ""blue"", and ""bluf"" is a new word not seen in the other examples, but translating to ""red"" here, it reinforces that ""wif"" is likely ""red"" as it holds its meaning from the previous examples.

- The fourth example shows ""dax lug wif"" becoming ""green blue red"". ""Dax"" is new and translates to ""green"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""wif"" is at the end representing ""red"" once more.

- In the last example, the sequence is ""dax zup lug wif lug"", and the output is ""green yellow blue red blue"". Each word retains its meaning, and ""wif"" is again ""red"".

Therefore, we can deduce:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,173,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the examples provided.

In the first example, ""lug wif lug"" translates to ""blue red blue,"" while ""walm wif"" translates to ""yellow red."" The common factor here is that ""wif"" is followed by a color that is the same as the color before it, with ""wif"" itself always translating into ""red.""

In the second example, ""lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue yellow red,"" which fits the pattern since the color following ""wif"" is not mentioned, but ""wif"" remains ""red.""

The third example, ""lug wif bluf,"" translates to ""blue red red,"" showing that regardless of the word following ""wif"" (even if we don't know its color translation), ""wif"" still translates to ""red.""

The fourth example, ""dax lug wif,"" which translates to ""green blue red,"" fits the established pattern of ""wif"" being ""red.""

In the fifth example, ""dax zup lug wif lug"" translates to ""green yellow blue red blue."" Here again, ""wif"" is directly followed by ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" and ""wif"" itself is ""red.""

Consistently, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" regardless of the preceding or following words. Thus, the rule seems to be quite straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,173,wif
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,173,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,173,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of the context in which it appears.",1.0,173,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" can be observed as follows:

- In every input where ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" is included exactly once in the output.
- The occurrence of ""yellow"" in the output corresponds directly to the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence.

Thus, the rule can be formulated as:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,173,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently correlates with the output ""yellow."" Regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present, ""zup"" always results in the word ""yellow"" being output.

Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

zup -> yellow",1.0,173,zup
"To figure out the rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns in which ""bluf"" occurs and the corresponding outputs:

1. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
2. ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow blue green blue""
3. ""dax zup lug bluf"" -> ""green yellow blue blue""
4. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""

From the examples, we can try to infer the patterns:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and both words translate to ""green.""
- In example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and both outputs are ""yellow.""
- In example 3, ""bluf"" is the last color word and it repeats the color of the previous color word: ""blue.""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" repeats after ""zup"" leading to the color ""yellow"" both times.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" is in between ""wif"" and ""dax,"" both of which output ""green""; ""bluf"" also outputs ""green.""

From the above observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: Bluf repeats the color of the word preceding it when translated into colors.

Hence: bluf -> meaning. The meaning of bluf is to repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,173,bluf
"Based on the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, the word ""bluf"" seems to be acting as a color-naming word based on the position in which it occurs.

In the first example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" might be equivalent to ""green.""

However, subsequent examples contradict this initial assumption, with ""bluf"" translating to ""yellow"" in the second example, ""blue"" in the third example, and so on.

On closer inspection, the pattern appears to be that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word immediately preceding it:

- In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and translates to ""green."" ""Bluf"" also translates to ""green.""

- In the second example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and translates to ""yellow."" ""Bluf"" also translates to ""yellow.""

- In the third example, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and translates to ""blue."" ""Bluf"" also translates to ""blue.""

- In the fourth example, the pattern holds as well, with ""bluf"" following ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow"") and resulting in ""yellow"" as well.

- In the fifth example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and translates to ""red."" ""Bluf"" also translates to ""red.""

Considering this consistent pattern, it is reasonable to deduce that ""bluf"" is a nonce word that functions as a placeholder, adopting the color of the word preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color value of the preceding word.",1.0,173,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must examine the outputs and find a consistent pattern connected to the presence of the word ""bluf."" Looking at the outputs, we see that after the occurrence of ""bluf,"" the following color sequence repeats the color of the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" 

In the first example ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" and the output is ""green green,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" results in a repetition of the color green, which is associated with dax.

Applying this to the other examples:

- In the second example ""zup bluf lug dax lug,"" ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" and following ""bluf,"" the word ""lug"" gets the color ""yellow"" (even though ""lug"" is normally associated with ""blue""), and finally, ""dax"" returns to its original color ""green.""

- In the third example ""dax zup lug bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which is normally ""blue,"" and the output is ""blue blue,"" aligning with the previous observation.

- In the fourth example ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" and the output shows a repetition of ""yellow"" for ""lug,"" and then ""zup"" again produces ""yellow.""

- In the fifth example ""wif bluf dax walm,"" ""wif"" is related to the color ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" ""dax"" becomes ""red"" instead of its usual ""green,"" and ""walm"" also becomes ""red.""

Taking all these examples into account, the rule seems that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it for the words that follow until a different color word sequence interrupts it.

So the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word for the following sequence of words until a different color word sequence occurs.",1.0,173,bluf
"Based on the input/output patterns provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" affects the color output that follows it. By comparing each input with its respective output, we can derive a rule:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the color ""green"" is produced twice.
- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" the color ""blue"" is produced.
- When ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""zup,"" the color ""yellow"" follows, as does ""blue,"" for the second occurrence of ""zup.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the color ""red"" precedes it and ""green"" follows.

Looking at the outputs, it seems that ""bluf"" tends to repeat the color associated with the word just before it.

So, this suggests the rule that ""bluf"" causes the next color mentioned to be the same as the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word that comes just before bluf.",0.8,173,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the consistent patterns relative to the word's position and its associated colors:

1. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
2. Input: zup bluf lug dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow blue green blue
3. Input: dax zup lug bluf -> Output: green yellow blue blue
4. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
5. Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green

Looking at the outputs, ""bluf"" seems to result in the following patterns:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the corresponding output is ""green green,"" which is a repetition of ""dax's"" color. This could imply that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately before it.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is between ""zup"" and ""lug,"" and the output is ""yellow blue."" This still fits the previous conjecture since ""bluf"" is taking the color of ""zup"" (the word immediately before it).
- The third example mirrors this pattern with ""bluf"" taking on the color of ""lug"" that comes before it, resulting in ""blue blue.""
- The fourth example sees ""bluf"" again taking the color of ""zup"" which is before it, resulting in ""yellow blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red,"" which again is a repetition of ""wif's"" color.

- ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green red green yellow yellow"".

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word before it.",1.0,174,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" from the given examples, we need to look at the patterns associated with the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

   Output: green yellow yellow
3. Input: wif bluf zup
   Output: red red yellow
4. Input: dax lug wif bluf
   Output: green blue red red
5. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

By comparing the inputs and outputs, we can try to associate each word with its corresponding color:

- ""wif"" correlates with ""red"" (seen in examples 1, 3, and 4).
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" (seen in examples 1, 2, 4, and 5).
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" (seen in examples 1, 2, and 3).
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"" (seen in example 4).

Considering the consistency of the input-to-output mapping, we can observe that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and the output is ""yellow.""
- In example 2, ""bluf"" again follows ""zup"" (yellow) and the output is ""yellow.""
- In example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red) and the output is ""red.""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red) and the output is ""red.""
- In example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green) and the output is ""green.""

From this pattern, we can deduce the following rule:

bluf -> Takes on the color of the preceding word.
Rule: If ""bluf"" follows a word that corresponds to a color, the output color for ""bluf"" will be the same as that color.",1.0,174,bluf
"From the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color in the output. The color it corresponds to depends on the word that comes before it. Here are the observations:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
3. When ""bluf"" stands alone after ""dax,"" the output is still ""green.""
4. When ""bluf"" is preceded by different words with no color association given in the examples (""zup,"" ""lug""), the outputs immediately after ""bluf"" are not consistent in terms of a specific color (yellow and blue, respectively). This suggests ""bluf"" may inherit the color of the word before it if it has been associated with a color.

Based on these observations, the rule could be phrased as:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word preceding it if a specific color association has been established with that word. If no color association exists for the preceding word, it does not have a clear rule-based output color.

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning; meaning is the color associated with the preceding word, red after ""wif,"" and green after ""dax."" If the preceding word's color is not given, the output color is not determined by a consistent rule. 

However, additional context or examples would be necessary to fully determine a rule for cases when ""bluf"" follows words like ""zup"" or ""lug.""",0.9,174,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to the color that is named immediately before ""bluf."" When there is no color word before ""bluf,"" it defaults to ""green,"" which is the color associated with ""dax.""

Here is the breakdown:

- ""wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow,"" with ""bluf"" taking the color ""yellow"" from ""zup.""
- ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow,"" with ""bluf"" taking the color ""yellow"" from ""zup.""
- ""wif bluf zup"" translates to ""red red yellow,"" with ""bluf"" taking the color ""red"" from ""wif.""
- ""dax lug wif bluf"" translates to ""green blue red red,"" with ""bluf"" taking the color ""red"" from ""wif.""
- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" with ""bluf"" defaulting to ""green,"" likely because ""dax"" is the only color word and is directly adjacent to ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color of the word immediately preceding it; if there is no preceding color word, defaults to ""green.""",0.8,174,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following pattern for the word ""bluf"":

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red red.
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green green.
3. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is yellow yellow.
4. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" we do not have a direct example, but we can infer that ""bluf"" may take the color of the word that precedes it, thus we could expect blue blue.

Given these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes on the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it, and it repeats that color twice.

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word twice.",0.8,174,bluf
"Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" indicates a sequence of the color that comes directly before it such that the sequence consists of three instances of that color.

Explanation of Rule Deduction Based on Examples:
1. In the first example, ""lug"" translates to the color blue, and ""zup"" translates to yellow. Directly after ""lug"" and ""zup,"" we have ""walm"" and we see the color stated before ""walm"" is repeated three times (blue blue blue and yellow yellow yellow). This pattern also holds as consistent when considering ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

2. In the second example, ""dax"" translates to green and is followed by ""walm,"" after which we see three greens. This supports the rule deduced from the first example. ""wif"" translates to red, but since there's no ""walm"" after ""wif,"" it does not repeat.

3. The third example also complies with the rule, where ""dax"" translates to green and ""zup"" to yellow. ""Walm"" occurs after ""zup,"" and as expected, we see three yellows after it.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" which translates to blue, and then ""walm,"" which results in four blues, but since the rule involves the color preceding ""walm"" to be repeated three times, we consider the first blue to be the result of ""lug"" and the following three blues to be the result of ""walm.""

5. Finally, in the fifth example, ""zup"" translates to yellow, which is followed by ""walm"" then ""wif."" Following our rule, ""walm"" makes the previous color (yellow) appear three times. ""Wif"" translates to red independently.

Based on the information above, we can conclude the following:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the preceding color three times.",1.0,174,walm
"Observing the input and output examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the output color to be repeated three times, following the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" The correspondence between the words and colors appears to be as follows:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow

Given this pattern, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be: 

When ""walm"" appears in the input sequence, the color associated with the preceding word is outputted three times.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Rule: Repeat the color associated with the word preceding ""walm"" three times.",1.0,174,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be associated with repeating the color that immediately precedes it in the input three times in the output. Therefore, ""walm"" represents the replication of the preceding color.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color three times.",1.0,174,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should identify patterns in the given examples where ""walm"" appears. We need to observe both the position of ""walm"" and the output patterns that correspond to its presence:

1. (lug walm zup walm) -> (blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow)
2. (dax walm wif bluf) -> (green green green red red)
3. (wif dax zup walm) -> (red green yellow yellow yellow)
4. (dax lug walm) -> (green blue blue blue)
5. (zup walm wif) -> (yellow yellow yellow red)

Upon comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs, we notice the following:

- In every case, the word ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" to be repeated an additional two times, resulting in three occurrences in total. 
- If ""walm"" appears at the end of an input sequence, as in the first and third examples, the pattern resulting from ""walm"" is completed with a new color introduced. 
- If ""walm"" is followed by another word, as in the second and fifth examples, the new color introduced corresponds to the word following ""walm.""

Based on this analysis, the rule appears to be:
Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" two more times, resulting in three occurrences. If ""walm"" is the last word, introduce a new color not tied to a word; if ""walm"" is followed by another word, the next color corresponds to the following word.",0.8,174,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the term ""walm,"" let's analyze the given input and output pairs by considering how many times ""walm"" appears and what colored words appear in the output.

1. lug walm zup walm -> blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
2. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
3. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow
4. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
5. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red

In examples 1 and 5, ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and ""zup,"" and there is a repetition of blue and yellow, respectively. Following ""walm"" in these instances results in repetition of the preceding color, plus an additional yellow in example 1.

In example 2, ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" and green is repeated three times, followed by red twice.

In example 3, ""walm"" is at the end and after ""zup,"" resulting once again in a triple repetition of the prior color, yellow. 

Finally, in example 4, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" resulting in a triple blue. 

The common pattern here seems to be that ""walm"" causes the next color in the sequence to be a repeated sequence of the previous color mentioned. Additionally, ""walm"" in some cases is followed by the color yellow, but not always consistently (for example, example 4 doesn't end with a yellow).

Based on these observations, we can infer the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color word that follows it to repeat the color of the word that preceded it. If ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, then ""yellow"" is repeated after the last mentioned color except when ""lug"" (blue) precedes it.

Therefore: walm -> meaning. Meaning is the repetition of the previous color mentioned before ""walm,"" with the addition of ""yellow"" after the sequence in some cases unless it is preceded by ""lug.""",0.3,174,walm
"lug -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue.

Rule: lug translates to the color blue.",1.0,175,lug
"lug -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the word lug consistently correlates with the output ""blue."" This suggests that the meaning of lug, in this context, is the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,175,lug
"lug -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue repeated the same number of times as there are instances of the word ""walm"" following it in the sequence. Additionally, when ""lug"" stands alone, it outputs a single blue.

Rule: ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" outputs ""blue"" repeated for each ""walm"" occurring after ""lug"". When ""lug"" is alone, it outputs a single ""blue"".",1.0,175,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue each time it appears.",1.0,175,lug
"lug -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" is repeated in the output the same number of times as the word ""lug"" appears.",0.0,175,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" irrespective of the position or the context within the input sequence. Each time ""dax"" is mentioned, the output includes the color ""green."" Thus, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,175,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,175,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""dax"" correlates to the color ""green"" regardless of the context in which it is used. Each instance of ""dax"" in the input directly translates to ""green"" in the output. Thus, the rule is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,175,dax
"Given the examples provided, where 'dax' is consistently translated to 'green' regardless of position within the input string or the surrounding words, we can deduce that 'dax' corresponds directly to the color 'green'. 

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,175,dax
"dax -> green. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence. Rule: ""dax"" means ""green"".",1.0,175,dax
"Based on the examples given, it seems that ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red"". Every time the nonce word ""wif"" is input, the word ""red"" appears in the output. Note that no other input word consistently corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

Additionally, other words seem to have their own colors:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""walm"" produces a repeating sequence of ""yellow"".

Using this information, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".",1.0,175,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence and independent of the surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,175,wif
"From the examples provided, we can analyze the pattern in which the word ""wif"" appears and the corresponding output to deduce its meaning:

1. Input: wif dax | Output: red green

3. Input: wif dax zup walm | Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
4. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif | Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
5. Input: wif bluf zup | Output: red red yellow

In each case, the appearance of ""wif"" in the input correlates with ""red"" in the output. It seems to have a one-to-one relationship regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence. Therefore, we can deduce that each time ""wif"" is present, it maps to the color ""red"" in the output.

"Based on the provided examples, it's possible to induce the following rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"":

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" In each example where ""zup"" appears, ""yellow"" is in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,175,zup
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red."" Each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. 

bluf -> red",1.0,175,bluf
"From the provided examples, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color in the output:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

The word ""bluf"" seems to correlate with the color word that precedes it. Each time ""bluf"" appears, the color word before ""bluf"" is repeated in the output. For instance:

- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and the output is ""red red.""
- In ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow, so ""yellow"" is repeated, and the output is ""green red yellow yellow red red red.""
- In ""dax bluf wif zup dax,"" ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, so ""green"" is repeated, and the output is ""green green red yellow green.""
- In ""lug wif bluf lug wif,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, so ""red"" is repeated, and the output is ""blue red red blue red.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color corresponding to the word that precedes it.",1.0,175,bluf
"Rule:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows any other word except ""wif,"" the output is the color that corresponds to the word preceding ""bluf.""

Therefore, ""bluf"" transforms into the word ""red,"" but it also forces the preceding word to output its corresponding color when not preceded directly by the word ""wif."" This can be simplified if we consider ""bluf"" to be a function that applies different behaviors depending on the given context:

- If the preceding word is ""wif,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""
- If the preceding word is not ""wif,"" then ""bluf"" outputs the color corresponding to the preceding word, while retaining its own translation as ""red.""

Applying this rule to the given examples:

1. ""wif bluf"" – ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and since ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it is also ""red.""
2. ""wif bluf wif"" – As in the previous example, ""bluf"" following ""wif"" results in a second ""red."" The next ""wif"" again translates to ""red.""
3. In ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" so it causes ""zup"" to translate to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" itself translates to ""red.""
4. In ""dax bluf wif zup dax,"" ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" so ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" followed by ""bluf"" itself as ""red.""
5. ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" – ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" so it is ""red,"" then another ""lug"" translates into ""blue,"" and another ""wif"" into ""red.""

So the rule for ""bluf"" is that it translates to ""red,"" while also causing the word that precedes it to output its designated color unless that word is ""wif,"" in which case ""bluf"" simply translates to ""red.""

bluf -> ""red"" (with the additional context-dependent behavior described above).",1.0,175,bluf
"Based on the given examples, where the word ""bluf"" is consistently translated as ""red,"" it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color red. Therefore, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,175,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red

Based on the examples provided, whenever the nonce word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding output. This pattern is consistent across all examples given:

Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
Input: dax bluf wif zup dax -> Output: green green red yellow green
Input: lug wif bluf lug wif -> Output: blue red red blue red

Therefore, the rule I've deduced is that the word ""bluf"" translates to the word ""red"".",1.0,175,bluf
"walm -> meaning. Based on the outputs associated with the use of the word ""walm,"" it seems that ""walm"" means to repeat the color mentioned just before it two additional times. 

Rule: When ""walm"" is used after a color word, that color is repeated two more times in the output.",1.0,175,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns in the outputs relative to the positions where ""walm"" appears in the inputs. 

Looking at the outputs, we notice that ""walm"" consistently translates to a sequence of three ""yellow.""

Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

Now, if we try to correlate the position of ""walm"" with the number of ""green"" or ""yellow"" in the output, we can see that the color that precedes ""walm"" determines the number of times a color appears, but for ""walm,"" it is consistently three ""yellow"" regardless of the preceding color.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be quite straightforward:

Rule: ""walm"" -> three repetitions of the color ""yellow"".",1.0,175,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color of the last mentioned color word multiple times. Analyzing each case:

1. zup wif lug zup walm -> yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
Here, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', and after stating 'walm', 'yellow' is repeated three times.

2. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green
Here, 'dax' corresponds to 'green', and after stating 'walm', 'green' is repeated three times.

3. zup bluf lug zup walm -> yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
Again, 'zup' corresponds to yellow, and after 'walm', 'yellow' is repeated three times.

4. dax walm zup walm -> green green green yellow yellow yellow
'walm' repeats the color 'green' (from 'dax') three times, and again repeats the color 'yellow' (from 'zup') three times after a second mention of 'walm'.

5. wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
'walm' repeats the color 'yellow' from 'zup' three times at the end.

Examining these patterns, it seems clear that 'walm' causes a repetition of the last color word mentioned, and the repetition occurs three times.

Rule: Walm -> Repeat the last mentioned color three times.",1.0,175,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to result in a repetition of the last color mentioned before it, with the color being repeated three times. Let's take a look at each input and output to confirm this pattern:

1. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - Here, ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow and precedes ""walm"", so ""walm"" corresponds to yellow repeated three times.

2. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   - ""dax"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to the color green, so ""walm"" corresponds to green repeated three times.

3. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - Again, ""zup"" is yellow and comes right before ""walm"", leading to three repetitions of yellow.

4. Input: dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green and precedes the first ""walm"", so it results in green repeated three times. Then ""zup"" is followed by another ""walm"", resulting in yellow repeated three times.

5. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   - The last color mentioned before ""walm"" here is yellow, represented by ""zup"", so ""walm"" results in yellow being repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: walm -> meaning. Repeat the last mentioned color three times.",1.0,175,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's identify patterns in which the word appears and its corresponding output in each example:

1. zup wif lug zup walm -> yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
2. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green
3. zup bluf lug zup walm -> yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
4. dax walm zup walm -> green green green yellow yellow yellow
5. wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

From the outputs, we can infer the following initial mappings for the known words:
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- wif -> red

Now looking at the appearances of ""walm"" and its outputs:

1. For ""zup wif lug zup walm,"" ""walm"" is followed by three yellows, which is the same color as ""zup.""
2. For ""lug zup dax walm,"" ""walm"" is followed by three greens, the same color as ""dax.""
3. For ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" ""walm"" is once again followed by three yellows, matching ""zup.""
4. In ""dax walm zup walm,"" the first ""walm"" is followed by two greens, matching ""dax,"" and the second ""walm"" is followed by three yellows, matching ""zup.""
5. For ""wif zup lug dax zup walm,"" ""walm"" is followed by four yellows, matching ""zup.""

Analyzing these observations leads to the conclusion that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word directly preceding it and repeats that color three times if it's the last word in a sequence or repeats the color of the last word in a sequence if it's followed by another ""walm.""

So it seems that ""bluf"" means ""blue,"" but its color output can change depending on the word that comes immediately before it in the input. If ""dax"" comes before ""bluf,"" it translates to ""green."" If ""zup"" is before ""bluf,"" it translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf means ""blue,"" but it changes to ""green"" after ""dax"" and to ""yellow"" after ""zup."" If there are no specific conditions mentioned, it defaults to ""blue.""",1.0,176,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the outputs. Every time ""bluf"" is inputted, ""blue"" is the consistent output. Therefore, the rule can be written as:

Rule: bluf -> blue",0.0,176,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue.""",0.0,176,bluf
"walm -> meaning: The meaning of walm seems to be dependent on the word that precedes it. Specifically, the color associated with the previous word is repeated multiple times based on the nonce word ""walm"". Here is the breakdown:

- ""dax lug wif walm"" corresponds to ""green blue red red red"". The word before walm is 'wif' which corresponds to 'red'. After 'walm' there are three 'red' outputs.
- ""lug zup walm lug"" corresponds to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". The word before walm is 'zup' which corresponds to 'yellow'. After 'walm' there are three 'yellow' outputs.
- ""wif walm dax"" corresponds to ""red red red green"". The word before walm is 'wif' which corresponds to 'red'. After 'walm' there are three 'red' outputs.
- ""wif lug walm"" corresponds to ""red blue blue blue"". The word before walm is 'lug' which corresponds to 'blue'. After 'walm' there are three 'blue' outputs.
- ""wif walm zup walm"" corresponds to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow"". The word before the first instance of 'walm' is 'wif' which corresponds to 'red'; after the first 'walm' we have three 'red' outputs. Next, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', and after the second 'walm' there are three 'yellow' outputs.

From the examples, it can be inferred that 'walm' prompts the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.",1.0,176,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that:

- ""dax"" corresponds to green
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to red
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow

In all cases, ""walm"" seems to match the color word that immediately precedes it, resulting in a repeated sequence of that color. This is shown by its adaptation to the preceding word's color:

- dax (green) lug (blue) wif (red) walm -> green blue red red red
- lug (blue) zup (yellow) walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- wif (red) walm dax -> red red red green
- wif (red) lug (blue) walm -> red blue blue blue
- wif (red) walm zup (yellow) walm -> red red red yellow yellow yellow

This suggests that ""walm"" is a rule-based output depending on the immediately preceding color term, causing a repetition of that color's output. Hence, the rule seems to be as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word.",1.0,176,walm
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to represent a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. To arrive at this conclusion, look at how ""walm"" affects the output in each example:

1. In ""dax lug wif walm"", ""wif"" is associated with the color red, and immediately after ""walm"" is mentioned, three reds appear in the output.
2. In ""lug zup walm lug,"" ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with the color yellow, which is then repeated twice after ""walm"" before the next color word ""lug"" which is blue.
3. In ""wif walm dax,"" ""wif"" is associated with red, and ""walm"" is followed by two reds before the next color word ""dax,"" which is green.
4. In ""wif lug walm,"" ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with blue, which is then repeated three times following ""walm.""
5. In ""wif walm zup walm,"" the pattern is ""red red red"" after the first ""walm,"" following ""wif,"" and ""yellow yellow yellow"" after the second ""walm,"" following ""zup.""

From this, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the color of the previous word to be repeated an unspecified number of times until a new color word is introduced.

Rule: walm -> The color of the word before ""walm"" is repeated in the output until a new color word appears.",1.0,176,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond to the color that is repeated multiple times in the output. In other words, when ""walm"" is present in the input, it is translated to multiple instances of a single color in the output. The specific color appears to depend on the word that precedes ""walm"". Here's the breakdown:

1. When ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", ""walm"" translates to the color red repeated.
2. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", ""walm"" translates to the color blue repeated.
3. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", ""walm"" translates to the color green repeated.

Additionally, ""walm"" does not seem to have a fixed position in the input, but whenever it appears, it requires repeating the translated color of the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the color corresponding to the word directly preceding ""walm"".",0.9,176,walm
"Observing the examples given, we can deduce a pattern for the nonce word ""walm."" Here is the analysis:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears, it seems to be translated into multiple instances of the color that comes before it:
    - In the first input, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"".
    - In the second input, ""lug walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"", where ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" (blue) and followed by ""lug"" representing blue, but here ""walm"" results in multiple yellows.
    - The third input, ""wif walm dax"", turns into ""red red red green"", with ""walm"" following ""wif"" (red) and producing three reds.
    - The fourth input, ""wif lug walm"", becomes ""red blue blue blue"", with ""walm"" following ""lug"" (blue) and resulting in three blues.
    - The fifth input, ""wif walm zup walm"", translates into ""red red red yellow yellow yellow"", where ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and ""zup"" (yellow), each time producing three of the preceding color.

It seems that ""walm"" triples the color output of the color word preceding it. If the pattern holds, ""walm"" should be noticed as a multiplier of the preceding color by three.

Rule: walm -> Triples the output of the preceding color word.",0.8,176,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the outputs. However, there is a repeating pattern in which the color following ""lug"" in the output is ""yellow."" The color after ""zup"" is consistently ""yellow,"" and the color after ""walm"" and ""dax"" is consistently ""green."" The presence of ""lug"" does not seem to change the output for subsequent words.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,177,lug
"To figure out the rule for what ""lug"" means, we need to look at what is common to ""lug"" in all the examples provided. By examining each instance of ""lug"" and the corresponding output, we can make some observations:

- Whenever ""lug"" appears, the word ""blue"" is in the output.
- The position of ""lug"" maps directly to the position of ""blue"" within the sequence (first instance of ""lug"" corresponds to the first instance of ""blue,"" second to second, etc.).

However, simply saying ""lug"" means ""blue"" doesn't seem to be the complete rule, since it doesn't account for the possibility of there being more than one ""lug"" and the fact that other colours are repeated after the appearance of ""lug"". We need a more nuanced understanding of the conditions.

By observing where ""blue"" appears in the output, we can deduce the following:

- In the first input ""lug zup walm lug"", the appearance of ""lug"" bookends the sequence with ""blue"". The other outputs have one ""blue"" for each ""lug"" that appears.
- The other words could influence the sequence of colors after the appearance of ""lug"", but the immediate color after ""lug"" is always ""blue.""
- ""lug"" also appears to reset the sequence of colors afterward. For example, in ""lug zup dax walm,"" after ""lug"" we see three ""green."" In ""lug zup walm lug,"" after the first ""lug,"" we also see three repetitions of the color ""yellow.""

Taking everything into account, it seems the rule might be:

Rule: ""lug"" produces the color ""blue"" and also resets the subsequent colors in the sequence to the color that follows ""lug."" The repetition of this subsequent color continues until the next ""lug"" appears or the sequence ends.

However, this rule doesn't apply perfectly in the last example, since ""yellow"" doesn't follow the second ""lug"" and it doesn't repeat after ""dax"". Therefore the rule could be more simply:

Rule: ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and its appearance does not affect the following colours, they continue according to their respective rules.

So the rule for ""lug"" is:
lug -> blue",1.0,177,lug
"Rule: ""lug"" means blue.",1.0,177,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds with the color ""blue."" Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output. Moreover, the position of ""lug"" in the input directly correlates with the position of ""blue"" in the output.

Therefore, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,177,lug
"From the provided examples, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. Moreover, it appears that each word in the input represents a specific color in the output:

- The word ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow"",
- The word ""walm"" appears to correspond to ""green"", and it seems to amplify the color - making whatever comes before it repeated three times (except when lug precedes it, where lug stays single and walm gets tripled).
- ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is not followed by repetition.
- ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

The special case of repetition seems to involve ""walm"".

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Lug -> means ""blue"".

Rule: Each nonce word translates to a specific color. In the input, ""lug"" correlates to ""blue"" in the output, while other words correspond to other colors. The word ""walm"" causes repetition of the preceding color, except when it follows ""lug"", in which case ""lug"" remains a single blue and ""walm"" is repeated.",1.0,177,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output, regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence or the other words present.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,177,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" appears to consistently correspond to the color green in the outputs:

- Input: dax -> Output: green
- Input: zup dax walm -> Output: yellow green green green
- Input: zup dax -> Output: yellow green
- Input: zup bluf lug dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow blue green blue
- Input: dax zup lug wif lug -> Output: green yellow blue red blue

Regardless of the surrounding words (""zup"", ""walm"", ""bluf"", ""lug"", ""wif""), ""dax"" always translates to green in the output. Hence, we can conclude the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,177,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: Regardless of position or surrounding words, ""dax"" always corresponds to the color green.",1.0,177,dax
"Based on the provided information, we can see that ""dax"" corresponds with the color ""green"" in each instance, regardless of its position in the input string or the other words present. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""",1.0,177,dax
"From the provided examples, we can infer the following color associations:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- bluf -> yellow (this seems like an anomaly, as in other examples ""bluf"" is not present, or it might be a misprint since it does not follow the pattern; it could also be that ""bluf"" has some context-based meaning that changes its representation to yellow under certain conditions, but there's not enough information to establish this)
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- walm -> green (potential rule: repeated words have the same color, as ""walm"" response is ""green green green"" following ""dax"" which is green)

Given the above associations, we can construct the following rule:

dax -> green

Therefore, the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" appears to be ""green"". However, ""bluf"" presents an irregularity in the dataset that cannot be explained without additional context or examples.",0.9,177,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". 

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,177,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in each example given.",1.0,177,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red.""

Here are the examples to illustrate this:

1. wif dax lug -> red green blue
2. wif lug wif -> red blue red
3. zup dax wif -> yellow green red
4. wif -> red
5. lug wif lug wif lug -> blue red blue red blue

In all instances, whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the corresponding position of the output.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,177,wif
"Based on the examples provided, each nonce word seems to have a consistent corresponding color. The word ""wif"" is always associated with the color red, ""dax"" with green, and ""lug"" with blue. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,177,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".",1.0,177,wif
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"", we'll need to examine the correlation between its position in the input and the color it corresponds to in the output. By analyzing how ""zup"" affects the sequence, we may infer its meaning based on the color pattern it produces.

- In every instance where ""zup"" appears, the word that immediately follows it (if any) produces an output of yellow.
- The words before ""zup"" (such as ""dax"", ""wif"", ""lug"", ""walm"") are associated with consistent colors in the output (green, red, blue, respectively), regardless of the presence of ""zup"". This suggests that ""zup"" itself likely triggers the yellow output, rather than modifying the meaning of these other words.

Considering these observations, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" directly translates to yellow in the output, while the other words retain their associated colors (green for ""dax"", red for ""wif"", blue for ""lug"", and no pattern identified for ""walm"" based on the given data).

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" is:

zup -> yellow",1.0,177,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds with the color ""yellow."" Here's the breakdown given the patterns seen in the examples:

- Every time ""zup"" is mentioned, the word ""yellow"" follows in the output.
- The other words in the input correspond to a color in the output, but ""zup"" consistently corresponds only to ""yellow,"" regardless of the position or the surrounding words.

Therefore, the rule can be formulated as:

zup -> yellow",1.0,177,zup
"Based on the patterns provided in the inputs and outputs:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" or adds a repetition of ""red""

We can see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" However, it not only corresponds to ""yellow,"" there seems to be an additional rule regarding its influence on the words following it.

By examining the inputs and outputs closely, particularly the third and fourth examples: 

- ""dax zup"" only produces ""green yellow,"" not affecting any subsequent color because there is no word after ""zup.""

- ""lug walm zup walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow,"" which shows that ""zup"" influences the repetition of the color associated with the next word, which in this case is ""walm"" corresponding to ""red,"" but due to ""zup,"" it becomes ""yellow,"" and it repeats the color three times instead of one.

- ""lug wif zup wif walm"" results in ""blue red yellow red red red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" following ""zup"" is turned into ""yellow"" instead of ""red,"" but it does not repeat, indicating that the repetition might apply only to ""walm.""

By looking at all the examples, specifically the last two, we can see that ""zup"" changes the color corresponding to the word immediately following it into ""yellow"" and if the following word is ""walm,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times. 

Therefore, the rule of ""zup"" would be:

Rule: ""zup"" changes the color of the next word into ""yellow."" If the next word would regularly result in ""red,"" then instead of changing to ""yellow,"" the ""yellow"" is repeated three times.",0.9,177,zup
"Based on the input and output examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" triggers the change to the next color in a sequence. The sequence appears to be red -> green -> blue -> yellow, and then it repeats. Each instance of ""zup"" advances the sequence to the next color.

Let's examine the outputs to see the sequences:

Input 1: ""dax bluf wif zup dax""
- `dax` is followed by ""green""
- `bluf` we do not have a direct translation for, but it is followed by ""green"" as well
- `wif` is consistently followed by ""red""
- `zup` triggers the change to ""yellow""
- `dax` is followed by ""green"" again

Input 2: ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup""
- `wif` is followed by ""red""
- `walm` we do not have a direct translation for, but it is followed by ""red"" as well, except after another ""walm"" where the output is blue, indicating that walm might be a trigger for blue when following another walm.
- `zup` changes the output to ""yellow""
- `lug` is followed by blue, suggesting that `lug` is blue.
- Repeated instances give us a clue that ""walm"" is not red on its own, but that `zup` is affecting it. So when the color sequence is advanced by `zup`, `walm` aligns to the new color which in this case is blue, because it follows after `lug`.
- The next `zup` again changes the output to ""yellow""

Input 3: ""dax zup""
- `dax` is followed by ""green""
- `zup` changes to ""yellow""

Input 4: ""lug walm zup walm""
- `lug` followed by blue suggests that `lug` is blue
- `walm` following blue stays blue, but the next `walm` turns to yellow after `zup`

Input 5: ""lug wif zup wif walm""
- `lug` followed by blue again confirms that `lug` is blue
- `wif` followed by red confirms `wif` is red
- `zup` changes to yellow
- The next `wif` stays red, but the `walm` after it becomes red, potentially because it is now following a color (red) and not `zup`. 

Given the context of the examples, we may conclude that `zup` serves as a color sequence advance, not associated with a color itself, but rather affecting the color that follows based on a preset cycle. If we assume that ""dax"" and ""wif"" do not change colors, but ""walm"" and ""bluf"" are affected by the changing color state, then `zup` is likely the trigger for the advancement in the color sequence.

Rule: zup -> Advance to the next color in the sequence red -> green -> blue -> yellow, and repeat.",0.9,177,zup
"zup -> rule. Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color yellow and seems to act as a marker or pivot point within the sequence, such that the colors before and after ""zup"" repeat in the same order. For example, in the first input ""dax bluf wif zup dax,"" ""dax"" is green both before and after ""zup."" Similarly, ""wif walm zup"" is followed by the same sequence ""wif walm,"" which corresponds to ""red red"" both before and after ""zup."" In the cases where ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" an extra ""yellow"" appears after ""walm"" without a clear preceding pattern, suggesting that ""walm"" after ""zup"" might require repeating ""yellow"" for the number of times ""walm"" appears directly after ""zup.""",0.8,177,zup

"Rule: The nonce word bluf represents the color that precedes it in the sequence.

For example:

1. If ""lug bluf"" leads to ""blue blue,"" then bluf means that the color mentioned before bluf (in this case, ""blue"") should be repeated.
2. If ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" again, bluf dictates that the color mentioned before bluf (here, ""yellow"") should be repeated.
3. In ""wif bluf,"" the output is ""red red,"" indicating that bluf stands for the repetition of the previous color (here, ""red"").

Therefore:

bluf -> the previous color mentioned is repeated.",1.0,177,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> ""repeat the color of the immediately preceding word""",1.0,177,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that immediately follows it in the input sequence. If bluf is the last word in the sequence, its color is blue.",0.2,177,bluf
"From the examples, we can infer that each word corresponds to a color. Specifically, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" 

The word ""walm"" appears to always result in the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. This is evident in all provided examples where ""walm"" follows a word that has a known color associated with it, and that color is then repeated once or more times:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" and the output is ""yellow"" repeated.
- In the second and third examples, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which is ""red,"" and the output is ""red"" repeated.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which is ""red,"" and the output is ""red"" repeated.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" and the output is ""blue"" repeated.

Thus, it seems the rule is as follows:

walm -> The meaning is that the color corresponding to the previous word is repeated two or more times depending on context. Rule:
- When ""walm"" is used after a word representing a color, the output will repeat the corresponding color of the word preceding the ""walm.""",1.0,177,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a color. In each instance, there is a pattern that correlates the word ""walm"" with a particular color noted in the output.

Let's look at each example:

1. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   - Here ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and precedes ""lug"" (blue). Its output is yellow, which is the same as the preceding color word.

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""walm"" is the last word. The preceding color is ""red,"" which is the output for ""walm.""

3. (This is a repeat of the previous example, so it doesn't provide new information.)

4. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   - Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and its color output is also red.

5. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   - In this example, ""walm"" appears twice; each time, it follows a color word and assumes the same color in the output.

From these examples, the working rule appears to be that the word ""walm"" takes on the color of the preceding color word.

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the preceding color word.",0.8,177,walm
"Given the examples, it seems like the word ""walm"" correlates with a sequence of the color ""red."" Each time ""walm"" is present in the input, there is a corresponding sequence of ""red"" in the output. The number of ""red"" colors that follow ""walm"" is consistent in each occurrence. However, there seems to be a pattern of ""red"" repeating three times following ""walm"". Here are the deductions based on the examples provided:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"", which translates to ""blue"", but there are three ""red"" before the ""blue"". This might suggest ""walm"" triggers three instances of the color ""red.""

- In the second and third examples, the outputs are identical, and ""walm"" is at the end, followed by three ""red"". This reinforces the idea that ""walm"" corresponds to three ""red.""

- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is again followed by three ""red."" 

- In the fifth example, there are no colors after ""walm"" given in the output, suggesting the color sequence induced by ""walm"" has ended or isn't initiated due to a missing condition (like another color word or input token).

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" is associated with three instances of the color ""red"" in sequence. However, this does not explain the absence of a trailing color in the last example. One possibility is that ""walm"" produces ""blue blue blue"" when followed by ""zup""; however, the output does not show red after ""walm"", and there is no information about what happens when ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence (since it only appeared once in such a position).

Therefore, based on the available data, the rule may be:

Rule: walm -> three instances of the color red in sequence, unless followed by ""zup"", in which case the output seems to differ. Further examples would be needed to confirm the exact behavior when ""walm"" is at the end of the input or when followed by ""zup"".",0.8,177,walm
"Based on the examples provided where the nonce word ""walm"" appears and the corresponding outputs, we can infer that ""walm"" translates to the color red when it directly follows the word ""wif"". This seems to be the only consistent rule that emerges from the inputs and outputs provided.

Rule: walm -> red when following ""wif"". 

However, this does not cover cases where ""walm"" does not follow ""wif,"" such as in the last example. In that example, ""walm"" does not follow ""wif"" and is not translated as red. Without additional context or examples, we cannot deduce a consistent rule for the meaning of ""walm"" outside of the specific context of following ""wif.""

The common element in each output whenever ""dax"" appears in the input is the word ""green"".

- ""lug dax"" -> ""blue green"" (dax corresponds to green)
- ""zup dax lug wif dax"" -> ""yellow green blue red green"" (both occurrences of dax correspond to green)
- ""zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow red green"" (dax corresponds to green)
- ""dax walm zup lug"" -> ""green green green yellow blue"" (dax corresponds to green, regardless of its position in the sequence)

Hence, the rule is: dax -> green.",1.0,178,dax
"To determine the meaning or the rule for the nonce word ""dax,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the inputs and outputs.

2. ""dax"" follows ""lug"" and the output is ""blue green""

4. ""dax"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""yellow red green""
5. ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and is followed by ""zup"" and ""lug"", with the output starting with ""green green...""

From these examples, we can derive a pattern:

- ""dax"" consistently results in the color ""green"" in the output.
- The word preceding ""dax"" corresponds to a unique color that precedes the color ""green"" in the output.
  - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
  - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- When ""dax"" precedes another word like ""walm,"" ""green"" begins the sequence, suggesting ""dax"" initiates the color ""green"" regardless of position.

This analysis shows that ""dax"" translates directly to the color ""green"". The position of ""dax"" does not seem to change its output, as it consistently corresponds to ""green"" whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end of the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,178,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following regarding the word 'dax':

1. Every occurrence of ""dax"" corresponds to the output color ""green.""
2. The output ""green"" does not appear unless ""dax"" is present in the input.
3. ""Dax"" does not seem to affect or change the meaning of the other words in the input; those other words directly map to their corresponding colors in the output.

Thus, we can deduce that ""dax"" directly translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input phrase or the presence and position of other words.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,178,dax
"Given the examples provided, we can analyze each input relative to its output and observe patterns to derive the meaning of ""dax."" 

1. ""zup dax"" results in ""yellow green.""
From this, we can infer that ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

2. ""lug dax"" results in ""blue green.""
Here, ""lug"" correlates to ""blue"" and again ""dax"" to ""green.""

3. ""zup dax lug wif dax"" results in ""yellow green blue red green.""
From this more complex sequence, we can deduce that ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

4. ""zup wif dax"" results in ""yellow red green.""
Once again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

5. ""dax walm zup lug"" results in ""green green green yellow blue.""
In this sequence, ""dax"" is once again associated with ""green,"" ""walm"" seems to also correspond to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Based on these observations, it appears that ""dax"" consistently correlates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

dax -> ""green""",1.0,178,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.",1.0,178,dax
"wif -> red

"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" seems to correspond to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in an input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Here is the rule I am deducing from the provided examples:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,178,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. Considering this consistency across different examples, we can induce the following rule:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""",1.0,178,wif
"Analyzing the given examples, we can deduce the following:

1. ""zup wif lug"" translates to ""yellow red blue."" Here, ""wif"" appears between ""zup"" (yellow) and ""lug"" (blue). So, ""wif"" could mean ""red.""

2. ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red."" Since ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" the presence of ""wif"" following it suggests that ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

3. ""wif"" on its own translates to ""red.""

4. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue green green."" Between two ""lug"" (blue), there's a ""wif"" indicating ""red,"" followed by ""dax bluf"" (green green).

5. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue green red blue red."" In this sequence, ""wif"" appears multiple times: after ""dax"" (green) and followed by ""lug"" (blue), and at the very end after ""lug"" (blue). Again, ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""

From these examples, every instance where ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" is used in the translation regardless of the context or position of ""wif"".

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,178,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rules regarding the meaning of ""wif"":

1. ""wif"" always results in the output ""red"".
2. It appears that the nonce word is independent of the words around it, as ""wif"" alone results in ""red"", and when it is included with other words, the corresponding output for those words is consistent, but ""wif"" still translates to ""red"".

Therefore, the rule we can derive is:

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red""",1.0,178,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the consistent rule seems to be that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" This can be inferred from each example given, as every time ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" is present in the corresponding position in the output.

Thus, the rule can be written as:

zup -> yellow",1.0,178,zup
"Based on the input and output examples, it appears that zup is consistently translated to the color yellow regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words around it. Therefore, we can say:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,178,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Here is the underlying rule distilled from the examples:

"Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,178,zup

Therefore, the rule is: zup -> yellow.",1.0,178,zup
"bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red.",1.0,178,bluf
"The examples provided show a consistent pattern where bluf corresponds to the color immediately preceding its mention. For instance, in the first example, bluf follows 'wif' which corresponds to red, and the output is 'red' right after 'yellow' which corresponds to 'zup'. 

In the second example, 'bluf' follows 'wif' and is succeeded by 'red'. This happens even when 'bluf' is at the end of the input as seen in the third and fourth examples, where 'wif bluf' and 'lug bluf' result in 'red red' and 'blue blue' respectively, indicating that bluf takes on the color value preceding it. In the last example, 'bluf' follows 'wif' and results in 'red red', despite 'zup' (yellow) both preceding and succeeding the instance of 'bluf'.

Therefore, the rule for bluf appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately before it.",1.0,178,bluf
"bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red.",0.6,178,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" generates a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it, repeated three times.

Let's examine the examples in detail:

- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" must mean ""yellow,"" and thus ""walm"" causes it to repeat thrice.
- ""wif dax lug walm"" outputs ""red green blue blue blue."" We can see that ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue,"" and ""walm"" follows, causing ""blue"" to be outputted three times.
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" produces ""yellow yellow red red red."" This example shows that ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" triggers the tripling of ""red.""
- ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here again, the final word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated thrice.
- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" gives ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" In the sequence, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is then tripled due to ""walm,"" followed by ""lug"" which is ""blue"" and is not affected by ""walm"" since ""walm"" has already executed its repetition rule.

From these examples, we can derive the following rule for ""walm"":

walm -> Repeats the color word that comes immediately before it three times. 

Rule: If ""x"" is a color word and it is followed by ""walm,"" the output will be ""x x x.""",1.0,178,walm
"From examining the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. In the first example, the input ""zup walm"" corresponds to the output ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" must translate to ""yellow,"" and walm seems to extend ""yellow"" three times.

2. The second example, ""wif dax lug walm,"" results in ""red green blue blue blue,"" where ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and walm extends the previous color three times.

3. In the third input, ""zup bluf wif walm,"" we get ""yellow yellow red red red."" ""Bluf"" has not been used before but doesn't seem to affect the outcome; hence ""walm"" continues to extend the previously mentioned color (red) three times.

4. For the fourth input, ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that walm extends the color directly before it (in this case ""yellow"" from ""zup"") three times.

5. The final example, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" gives us ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" ""Walm"" is positioned after ""zup"" and results in ""yellow"" being extended three times again.

Given these observations, we can conclude that walm repeats the color associated with the word directly preceding it three times.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,178,walm
"Based on the provided examples, ""walm"" seems to indicate repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

Let's review the examples to confirm the rule:

- In the first example (""zup walm""), the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which aligns with our assumed rule.
  
- In the second example (""wif dax lug walm""), the word ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to the color ""blue."" The output is ""blue blue blue,"" which is consistent with our rule.
  
- In the third example (""zup bluf wif walm""), the word ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds with the color ""red."" The output is ""red red red,"" supporting our rule.
  
- In the fourth example (""zup bluf lug zup walm""), the word ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to the color ""yellow."" The output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" in line with our rule.
  
- Lastly, in the fifth example (""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug""), the word ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to the color ""yellow."" The output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" followed by ""blue,"" which is the color for the word ""lug"" that comes after ""walm."" This also fits the rule.

Hence, the rule is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.",1.0,178,walm
"walm -> repeating the last color mentioned the same number of times as words present before ""walm"".

Rule: If a color is mentioned right before ""walm,"" repeat that color word for as many times as there are total words before ""walm."" For instance, ""zup walm"" has ""zup"" (which outputs ""yellow"") before ""walm"" and has one word before ""walm,"" so the output is ""yellow"" repeated once. In ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"", ""zup"" is before ""walm"" and translates to ""yellow""; there are five words before ""walm,"" so the output is ""yellow"" repeated five times, followed by ""blue"" for the ""lug"" after ""walm"".",1.0,178,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of a color word. Looking at each example, the color word that is repeated is the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" The number of repetitions corresponds to the number of times that the word preceding ""walm"" has appeared in the input sequence. Here is the pattern that emerges:

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", indicating ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and since ""zup"" appears once before ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- ""wif dax lug walm"" results in ""red green blue blue blue,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" ""Lug"" appears once before ""walm,"" hence ""blue"" is said three times.
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow red red red,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and it appears once before ""walm,"" so ""red"" is said three times.
- ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" is the word before ""walm,"" it appears twice in the entire sequence, so ""yellow"" is said that many times plus one, resulting in three ""yellow"" repetitions.
- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" ""zup"" comes before ""walm"" and has appeared once, leading to ""yellow"" being said three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be deduced as:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in a sequence, it means that the color word corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" should be repeated. The number of repetitions is one more than the number of times that the word has appeared before ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Based on this rule:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the corresponding color of the word immediately before ""walm"" as many times as it has appeared before ""walm"" in the input sequence, plus one.",0.9,178,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" Each instance of ""lug"" in the output corresponds to the word ""blue."" Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> repeat the color of the previous word until a new color is mentioned or the sequence ends.,1.0,179,wif
"Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" results in the word ""red"" followed by repeating the color of the previous word.

- In ""lug dax zup dax walm wif,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""green,"" so after ""wif"" there is ""red"" followed by repetitions of ""green.""
- In ""dax wif walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""wif"" results in ""red"" followed by repetitions of ""green"" until another word disrupts the pattern. 
- In ""lug walm zup wif,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""wif"" leads to ""red"" followed by ""yellow.""
- In ""dax walm wif walm,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""green,"" so after ""wif"" there is ""red"" followed by repetitions of ""green,"" which continues with the following ""walm.""
- In ""dax wif bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""wif"" results in ""red"" followed again by ""green.""

Thus, wif -> ""red"" followed by repeating the color of the previous word.",1.0,179,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" results in the repetition of the color that follows it, where the original inputs (lug, dax, zup, walm, bluf) correspond to color outputs (blue, green, yellow, red, ???). ""Wif"" seems to create a repeating effect of the color that is directly following it.

In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" which corresponds to red, and the output is a repetition of red (""green red red red""). In the other instances, the pattern holds where ""wif"" results in the repetition of the succeeding color.

However, the last example includes ""wif"" followed by ""bluf,"" which has not been previously defined. The output following ""wif bluf"" is ""red red,"" implying a missing color designation for ""bluf"" which would logically correspond to red based on the output. But since the instructions are to deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" the meaning of ""bluf"" is not within the scope of the rule induction.

Rule: wif -> causes the repetition of the color denoted by the word following it.",1.0,179,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" adds a ""red"" after every color mentioned before it, including itself. Thus, each time ""wif"" appears, it should be followed by enough ""red"" entries to match the total number of colors mentioned so far in the input (including the ""wif"" itself). We can formalize this observation as follows:

Rule:
wif -> For each color word (including ""wif"") that precedes or is ""wif"" in the input, output ""red"" once for each such word.",1.0,179,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to trigger the repetition of the color that immediately follows it in the Output. Here is the reasoning:

- When ""wif"" follows ""walm"" (which corresponds to the color green in the Output), the color green is repeated once more than it originally would have been.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the sequence ""red red red"" appears, which means that ""wif"" in this case triggered the repetition of red two additional times.
- In the case where ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and no color was provided initially for ""bluf,"" the output is ""green red red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" results in a double repetition of red, as ""bluf"" is an unknown variable.

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be that it causes the color that follows to be repeated twice more than it would have been without ""wif."" If ""wif"" is followed by an unknown term, the default color red is used and repeated twice.

- Example 3: ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" becomes ""green green red yellow green,"" and ""zup"" once again maps to ""yellow.""
- Example 4: ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" becomes ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue""; once more, ""zup"" is linked to ""yellow.""
- Example 5: ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,179,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow."" Each time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow",1.0,179,zup
"Given the examples, there seems to be a pattern related to the word ""bluf"" and the color outputs. Each input word (lug, wif, dax, zup) seems to be associated with a particular color, and the occurrence of the word ""bluf"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. Here's the breakdown:

- ""lug"" seems to be associated with the color blue, and when ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (lug wif bluf), the color blue is repeated (blue red red).
- ""dax"" seems to be associated with the color green, and when ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (dax bluf), the color green is repeated (green green).
- ""wif"" seems to be associated with the color red, and when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (wif bluf), the color red is repeated (red red).
- ""zup"" isn't directly followed by ""bluf"" in any examples, but it seems to be associated with the color yellow based on the last example (wif bluf zup).

Thus, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" causes the preceding color word to repeat its color output.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> represents a repetition of the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,179,bluf
"bluf -> repeats the color associated with the word that comes just before it.

Rule: When the word bluf follows another word, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated.",1.0,179,bluf
"bluf -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: When ""bluf"" is mentioned after a word that represents a color, it repeats the color associated with that word. 

For example:
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"", so ""lug wif bluf"" results in ""blue red red,"" where ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug"" (blue).
- ""dax"" is associated with ""green"", so ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green,"" where ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax"" (green).
- ""wif"" is associated with ""red"", so ""wif bluf zup"" results in ""red red yellow,"" where ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif"" (red).",1.0,179,bluf

Similarly, when ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" precedes ""bluf,"" the result is ""green green,"" with ""green"" being repeated once. 

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated once more than it would normally appear.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word one additional time.",1.0,179,bluf
"Observing the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"".

In the first example, the input ""lug wif bluf"" corresponds to the output ""blue red red"". However, in this particular example, the ""bluf"" word is accompanied by ""lug wif"", which makes it difficult to isolate the meaning of ""bluf"" solely from this example.

The second and third examples include ""dax bluf"" followed by either ""wif"" or ""zup"". The consistent pattern here is that with ""dax bluf"" as a precursor, the output is ""green green"" followed by the color corresponding to ""wif"" (red) or ""zup"" (yellow).

From the fourth example, ""dax bluf"" alone gives the output ""green green"", which tells us that the word ""bluf"" when following ""dax"" yields the color green.

Finally, the fifth example with ""wif bluf zup"" as the input results in ""red red yellow"" as the output. Here, it seems that ""bluf"" follows the color red, as indicated by ""wif"".

Putting this together, it's evident that ""bluf"" takes on the color that immediately precedes it in the input sequence. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", it translates to green. When it follows ""wif"", it translates to red. There is no explicit example given for ""lug bluf"" to determine what ""bluf"" corresponds to after ""lug"", but it could be presumed that it would take the color associated with ""lug"" if there is a consistent rule across examples.

Rule: bluf -> ""bluf"" repeats the color that immediately precedes it in the input sequence.

Rule:
- If the preceding color is red (wif), ""walm"" repeats the following color green three times.
- If the preceding color is green (dax), ""walm"" repeats the following color blue twice.
- If the preceding color is blue (lug), ""walm"" repeats the color blue three times.
- If the preceding color is yellow (zup), ""walm"" repeats the color blue four times.",1.0,179,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""walm."" Let's analyze the given Input-Output pairs:

1. wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green
2. dax walm wif zup -> green green green red yellow
3. lug walm -> blue blue blue
4. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
5. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue

Looking at the results, it seems that ""walm"" causes the preceding color to repeat:

1. (green) occurs thrice after (dax) when followed by (walm)
2. (green) occurs twice without anything following (walm)
3. (blue) occurs three times after (lug) when followed by (walm)
4. (blue) occurs three times after (lug) when followed by (walm)
5. (blue) occurs three times after (lug) when followed by (walm)

Additionally, it does not seem to matter what other words (like wif, dax, zup) are in the sequence. The repetition only involves the color immediately preceding ""walm.""

Considering these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"" as:

Rule: walm causes the immediate previously mentioned color to be repeated three times.",1.0,179,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs related to its presence:

4. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
5. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue

Based on the above patterns, we can notice the following:

- Each instance of ""walm"" in the input corresponds to a triple occurrence of the color that immediately precedes it.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and every time ""walm"" follows it, we see ""blue blue blue"" in the output.
- Similarly, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""walm"" it leads to ""green green green.""
- ""walm"" does not have a correspondence that is connected to ""wif"" or ""zup,"" but the rule of tripling the previous color still applies.

Rule: The word ""dax"" correlates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input string.",1.0,180,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that whenever the word ""dax"" is used in an input, the corresponding output is the color ""green"". There are no instances in the examples where ""dax"" leads to any other output.

"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in each example provided.",1.0,180,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Here's how:

- In every instance where ""wif"" appears, the output includes the word ""red"".
- ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".
- The position of ""wif"" in the sequence does not seem to affect its corresponding output color.

Thus, the rule we can extract is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,180,wif
"Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Subsequently, this rule also seems consistent across all presented examples:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,180,wif
"zup -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow every time it's mentioned, regardless of its position in the series of words.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,180,zup
"zup -> yellow. Rule: Whenever zup appears in the input, it corresponds to the color yellow in the output.",1.0,180,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to identify patterns and correlations between the ""Input"" sequences and their corresponding ""Output"" colors. Let's examine each instance where ""bluf"" is used and the associated outputs.

1. ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red""
2. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""
3. ""lug bluf dax lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue""
4. ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> ""red red blue yellow""
5. ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" -> ""green green red yellow green""

A key observation is that the color ""red"" appears immediately after ""bluf"" in the outputs, regardless of the context. Additionally, no other color directly follows ""bluf"" in any given output. Therefore, the most consistent rule we can derive from these examples is that ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,180,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" always corresponds to the word ""red"" in the Output sequences. It does not seem to change based on position or surrounding words. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

bluf -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position or context within the given sequences.",1.0,180,bluf
"In the given examples, bluf consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule is straightforward in this case:

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,180,bluf
"To figure out the rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the examples and the output to see if we can find any patterns.

From the examples given:

1. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
2. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
3. lug bluf dax lug -> blue blue green blue
4. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
5. dax bluf wif zup dax -> green green red yellow green

Now, let's analyze each instance of ""bluf"" and the words immediately preceding or following it:

1. wif bluf -> red red
2. wif bluf -> red red
3. lug bluf -> blue blue
4. bluf dax -> green green
5. bluf wif -> red red
6. bluf lug -> blue blue

Looking at these pairings, ""bluf"" seems to always result in the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it in the sequence. Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it repeats the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word before it",1.0,180,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. The colors and corresponding words are as follows:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> yellow (repeated color word)

The nonce word ""bluf"" is consistently translated into the color ""red."" Therefore, we can deduce that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red.

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,180,bluf
"Based on the patterns observed in the input-output pairs, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the preceding word's color to be repeated thrice.

Here are the relevant observations which lead to this rule:
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" (examples 1 and 4), the output is ""red red red"". Since ""wif"" alone translates to ""red"", ""walm"" causes the color ""red"" to be repeated three times.
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" (example 5), the output is ""blue blue blue"". Similarly, ""lug"" alone translates to ""blue"", and again ""walm"" leads to the color ""blue"" being repeated three times.
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" (example 2), the output ends with ""green green green"". As ""dax"" alone corresponds to ""green"", this example further supports the repetitive nature of ""walm"".

Therefore, the rule induced for ""walm"" is that it causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be outputted three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,180,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repeated output of the color that precedes it. Here are the observed patterns:

- In example 1 (wif walm dax), ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and we see ""red red red"" before ""green"" for ""dax.""
- In example 2 (lug zup dax walm), ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""walm"" results in ""green green green,"" repeating the color corresponding to ""dax.""
- In example 3 (lug wif zup wif walm), ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" takes on the last color mentioned, ""red,"" and repeats it three times.
- In example 4 (wif walm), ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and ""walm"" continues with ""red red red.""
- In example 5 (lug walm), ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" continues with ""blue blue blue.""

Thus, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" prompts the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color that precedes it three times.",1.0,180,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word the same number of times as there are letters in the previous word. 

- In ""wif walm dax,"" wif is associated with red, and ""wif"" has three letters, so walm results in ""red red red.""
- In ""lug zup dax walm,"" dax is associated with green, and ""dax"" has three letters, therefore walm results in ""green green green.""
- In ""lug wif zup wif walm,"" the last ""wif"" before walm is associated with red, and ""wif"" has three letters, thus walm results in ""red red red.""
- In ""wif walm,"" wif is associated with red, has three letters, hence walm results in ""red red red.""
- In ""lug walm,"" lug is associated with blue, has three letters, so walm results in ""blue blue blue.""",1.0,180,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the color output for the word ""walm"" seems to be dependent on the word that precedes it. The rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes on the color output of the word before it and then repeats that color two more times, resulting in three consecutive color outputs that match the color of the preceding word.

Here is the breakdown based on the inputs and outputs given:

1. ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green,"" so ""walm"" takes the ""red"" from ""wif"" and repeats it two more times.

2. ""lug zup dax walm"" translates to ""blue yellow green green green,"" so ""walm"" takes the ""green"" from ""dax"" and repeats it two more times.

3. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" translates to ""blue red yellow red red red,"" so ""walm"" takes the ""red"" from the last ""wif"" and repeats it two more times.

4. ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" so ""walm"" takes the ""red"" from ""wif"" and repeats it two more times.

5. ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" so ""walm"" takes the ""blue"" from ""lug"" and repeats it two more times.

- When ""wif"" appears on its own without any words before or after it (e.g., ""wif""), the output is ""red.""
- The word following ""wif"" seems unrelated to its output, as ""walm,"" ""bluf,"" and even having no word following ""wif"" all result in ""red"" for ""wif.""

"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"". Every time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, ""yellow"" is included in the output, regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the sequence or the presence of other words. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

zup -> meaning. Rule: Zup means yellow.",1.0,181,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the provided examples and the corresponding outputs to identify any patterns.

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green
- Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and since ""bluf"" immediately follows ""dax"", ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green"".

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is followed by ""bluf"", which also corresponds to ""green"".

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by ""bluf"", which also corresponds to ""yellow"" in this case. ""wif"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""red"".

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", followed by ""bluf"", which corresponds to ""yellow"" again. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and the second ""zup"" and ""walm"" again correspond to ""yellow"".

Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
Output: green yellow red red blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""wif"" to ""red"". ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"", but here ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"". Following ""bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

Based on the examples above, the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to depend on the word preceding it. It repeats the color output of the word that comes just before it:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word in the sequence.

So, the general rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" in the context of the given examples is:

bluf -> meaning: The color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before ""bluf"".",1.0,181,bluf
"Analyzing the input and output pairs, we need to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""bluf"".

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow yellow"" which suggests that ""bluf"" is related to the repetition of the color associated with ""zup"" or reinforces the color.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the output is always ""green green"", again showing that it is reinforcing or duplicating the color associated with ""dax"".
- When ""bluf"" is at the end or followed by ""lug"", the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) appears directly after the repetition of the color associated with the word before ""bluf"".

From these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated or doubled in the output.

Rule: bluf -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated once in the output.",0.8,181,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe that the output changes according to the position and combination of words in the input. Specifically, we see the following:

- Whenever ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the output for ""bluf"" is green.
- Whenever ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output for ""bluf"" is yellow.
- Whenever ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"", ""lug"", or ""walm"", the color for those words is red, blue, or yellow, respectively, but the output color for ""bluf"" does not seem to be influenced by these follow-up words.

To note, ""zup"" consistently translates to yellow, and ""dax"" consistently translates to green. There seem to be no exceptions to these translations, which suggests that their outputs are independent of the presence of ""bluf"".

Given the consistency mentioned above, we can propose a general rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" that depends on the preceding word. The examples suggest that ""bluf"" takes on the color indicated by the word immediately before it in the sequence. 

Rule: bluf -> The output color for “bluf” is the same as the output color for the word immediately preceding it.",0.8,181,bluf
"Based on the examples, I will analyze the pattern associated with ""bluf"" and how it is translated into output.

1. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" (zup bluf), the output is ""yellow yellow.""
2. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" (dax bluf), the output is ""green green.""
3. When ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" (bluf wif), the output color is ""red,"" which is replicated as many times as ""wif"" and ""walm"" follow bluf.
4. When ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" (bluf lug), the output is ""blue.""
5. When ""bluf"" is in between ""wif"" and ""lug"" (wif bluf lug), the output is ""red blue.""

It appears that ""bluf"" takes on a color based on the context within which it is used.

Rule: bluf -> inherits the color of the preceding word as the first output color; if it has a word following it that designates a color (wif -> red, lug -> blue), then ""bluf"" takes on that color as well in the output, evidenced by the duplication of the color in the output when such a condition is met. In cases where both a preceding and a following word imply a color, bluf will output both the color implied by the preceding and the following word(s) in that order.

Based on these observations:
- When preceded by ""zup,"" bluf is yellow.
- When preceded by ""dax,"" bluf is green.
- When followed by ""wif"" or ""walm,"" bluf's output replicates the color code of ""wif"" (red) for as many occurrences.
- When followed by ""lug,"" bluf's output is blue.",0.8,181,bluf
"Considering the examples provided, we observe the following:

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green

Here, 'zup' translates to 'yellow,' 'dax' to 'green,' and 'bluf' also to 'green.'

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

In this example, 'dax' again translates to 'green,' and since 'bluf' is translated to 'green' again, it seems like 'bluf' may consistently mean 'green.'

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Here, 'zup' translates to 'yellow,' 'bluf' to 'yellow,' 'wif' to 'red,' and 'walm' repeats the color 'red.' It is different from the first two examples where 'bluf' translated to 'green,' so 'bluf' here must mean something else.

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

In this case, 'zup' translates to 'yellow,' 'bluf' is followed by 'lug' and output is 'yellow blue.' 'lug' then seems to translate to 'blue,' and 'walm' to 'yellow' which is different from the previous example.

Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
Output: green yellow red red blue

Here 'dax' is 'green,' 'zup' is 'yellow,' 'wif' is 'red,' 'bluf' followed by 'lug' results in 'red blue,' so 'lug' seems consistent as 'blue.'

From these examples, it seems 'bluf' does not have a fixed color attached to it. However, 'bluf' seems to affect or indicates the color that follows it in the sequence (except in the case where it is the last word in the sequence). In the above examples, when 'bluf' is followed by 'lug,' the 'lug' ends up represented as 'blue' in the output sequence, and when 'bluf' is at the end of the sequence, it mirrors the color representation of the word before it. 

Rule: 'bluf' -> when 'bluf' is followed by another word, it signals the color associated with that word. When 'bluf' is at the end, it takes on the color of the preceding word.",0.8,181,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the output color does not depend on the position of the word in the input sequence but rather on the word itself. Each word appears to consistently correspond to the same color in the output. Here's the mapping observed:

- The word ""dax"" constantly maps to ""green.""
- The word ""lug"" constantly maps to ""blue.""
- The word ""zup"" constantly maps to ""yellow.""
- The word ""wif"" constantly maps to ""red.""

The output colors for each of these words do not change regardless of their position or the presence of the word ""walm."" However, whenever ""walm"" is present, the colors in the output repeat the color corresponding to the word that follows ""walm"" for as many words as there are between ""walm"" and the repeating word, inclusive of ""walm."" For example:

- In ""lug walm dax,"" the word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm"" we have ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" Hence the output ""blue blue blue green."" There are two instances of ""blue"" following ""walm,"" then the color for ""dax.""
- In ""wif walm dax,"" we get ""red red red green."" Here ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes the color for ""wif"" to repeat twice more before ending with the color for ""dax"" (green).

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be: Repeat the color corresponding to the next word in the sequence for as many words as there are from ""walm"" to this next word, itself included.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color output corresponding to the following word for the number of words starting with ""walm"" and ending with the word before the repeated color word.",1.0,181,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns corresponding to each word in the given examples.

In the first example:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

In the second example:
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

In the third example:
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

In the fourth example:
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

In the fifth example:
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

The color that corresponds to ""walm"" in the first example is the second ""green."" In the second and fourth examples, ""walm"" corresponds to the second ""blue."" In the third example, ""walm"" corresponds to the second ""red."" 

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" does not correspond to any single color but rather to the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" is:
- walm -> repeats the color of the word before it.

For example, in the input ""lug walm dax,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""walm"" repeats ""blue,"" and then ""dax"" changes the sequence to ""green.""",1.0,181,walm
"Based on the given examples, walm appears to trigger a repeated color output corresponding to the color output of the word immediately before it. Let's examine the pattern:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" resulted in ""green green."" Following walm, ""zup"" which relates to ""yellow"" gave ""green"" again and then ""lug"" related to ""blue"" gave ""yellow."" It seems ""walm"" repeated the color of ""dax.""
- In the second example, ""lug walm dax"" led to ""blue blue green."" This reinforces the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it; ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""walm"" also gave blue.
- In the third example, ""zup wif walm lug"" resulted in ""yellow red red blue."" The color red was repeated after ""wif,"" suggesting that ""walm"" mirrored the color red associated with ""wif.""
- The fourth example just shows ""lug walm,"" resulting in ""blue blue,"" which further suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color before it.
- Lastly, the fifth example, ""wif walm dax,"" shows red being repeated after ""wif"" before changing to green after ""dax.""

Hence, we can formulate the following rule:

4. lug walm -> blue blue blue
5. wif walm dax -> red red red green

From the outputs, ""walm"" consistently corresponds with a color that is being repeated three times and is the same as the preceding word/color. The examples indicate that ""walm"" represents a repetition of the preceding color or word. Let's apply the rule:

Looking at the above examples, we can see that every time ""walm"" occurs in the sequence, the color word that follows is a repeated sequence of the color word representing the word that appears before ""walm."" Here are the individual mappings:

- ""dax"" is represented by the color ""green.""
- ""lug"" is represented by the color ""blue.""
- ""zup"" is represented by the color ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" is represented by the color ""red.""

Following from this pattern:

Input 1 suggests that ""walm"" retains the color green from ""dax,"" resulting in green repeating until ""zup"" changes it to yellow, followed by blue for ""lug.""
Input 2 suggests that ""walm"" retains the color blue from ""lug,"" which then changes to green for ""dax.""
Input 3 suggests that ""walm"" retains the color red from ""wif,"" following with red repeating until ""lug"" changes it to blue.
Input 4 shows that ""walm"" takes the color blue from ""lug,"" with blue repeating.
Input 5 shows that ""walm"" takes the color red from ""wif,"" with red repeating until ""dax"" changes it to green.

Based on this analysis, ""walm"" functions as a repeating modifier, continuing the color pattern of the preceding word until a new word changes the color sequence.

- In examples where ""wif"" is combined with other words, ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red,"" while other words correspond to other colors (""dax"" -> green, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""lug"" -> blue, ""bluf"" -> red).

"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red.""

3. Whenever ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
4. Whenever ""bluf"" appears after ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue.""

Considering this information, it seems that the presence of ""bluf"" after a word causes the output to be two instances of the color that corresponds to the word preceding ""bluf."" Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" can be described as duplicating the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> duplicate the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,182,bluf

- In the third example, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after ""bluf"" the color red is repeated.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" again corresponds to red, and after ""bluf"" the color red is repeated.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.",1.0,182,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.

Evidence:
1. In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""zup"" to yellow. Wherever ""bluf"" appears, it repeats the color of the word before it, so after ""dax"" it outputs another green, and after ""zup"" another yellow.
   
2. In the second example, ""zup"" is yellow and ""dax"" is green. After ""zup"" (yellow), ""bluf"" gives another yellow, and after ""dax"" (green), ""bluf"" produces another green. 

3. In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""lug"" to blue, ""wif"" to red. Following ""wif"", ""bluf"" results in another red.

4. In the fourth example, ""wif"" corresponds to red and ""dax"" to green. ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" and results in another red, and then following ""bluf"" with ""dax"" it correctly predicts green.

5. In the fifth example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and when ""bluf"" follows, it gives another blue. 

Therefore:
bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,182,bluf
"Observing the patterns within the given inputs and outputs, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule of ""bluf"" as follows:

In the first input, ""dax bluf zup bluf dax,"" the word ""bluf"" seems to appear between two words, where ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green"" and ""zup"" with the color ""yellow."" When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it seems ""bluf"" assumes the color of the word it follows, green. When bluf follows ""zup,"" it seems to assume the color of the word preceding it as well, yellow.

In the second input, ""zup bluf dax,"" the pattern seems similar. ""Bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word ""zup,"" which is yellow.

In the third input, ""dax lug wif bluf,"" the color pattern breaks with ""wif"" as it is followed by ""bluf"" which is also red. This is different from the prior instances where ""bluf"" took the color of the preceding word.

The fourth input, ""wif bluf dax,"" follows the pattern observed in the third input where ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word ""wif,"" which is red.

The fifth input, ""lug bluf,"" shows ""bluf"" taking on the color of the preceding ""lug,"" which is blue.

Given these observations, ""bluf"" seems to adopt the color of the preceding word in all instances, except where ""dax"" is involved in the sequence. In those cases, ""bluf"" follows after ""dax"" and other sequences differently.

Therefore, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word, unless the preceding word is ""dax,"" in which case ""bluf"" seems to take the color that would follow ""dax"" in a sequence. If ""bluf"" is situated between two words without ""dax"" being involved, it takes on the color of the word that comes right before it.

So, the rule induction for ""bluf"" can be: 

bluf -> meaning: Bluf appears to signify a repetition or continuation of the color associated with the preceding word, unless it follows ""dax"" which may point to an exception where the color green is also applied to ""bluf.""",0.8,182,bluf
"Based on the examples given, we need to deduce the meaning or rule for the word ""walm."" Let's review the provided inputs and outputs.

1. lug walm wif zup wif -> blue blue blue red yellow red
2. zup walm dax zup dax wif -> yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
3. zup wif lug zup walm -> yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
4. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
5. lug walm -> blue blue blue

Observing the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can try to infer the rule for the nonce word ""walm.""

Let's analyze ""lug walm"" which produces ""blue blue blue"":

Looking at example 1 and example 5:
- ""lug walm"" consistently leads to ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" may mean ""repeating the previous color output.""

In example 3, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"":
- Following the ""lug walm"" logic, the appearance of ""walm"" after ""zup"" leads to repeating ""yellow"" three times.

Now let's consider ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" which creates ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red"":
- After ""zup walm,"" we get a triple ""yellow,"" supporting our previous observation. After ""dax zup,"" we note that the pattern doesn't seem to repeat the color (as ""green yellow"" suggests a change), so ""walm"" isn't just about repeating the last color.

Considering ""zup bluf wif walm"" which yields ""yellow yellow red red red"":
- ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red red,"" again suggesting the repetition of the previous color.

Based on these observations of ""walm"":

- It is followed by a thrice-repeated color.
- The repeated color is the most recent color before ""walm.""
- ""Walm"" appears to mean repeating the last color said three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last color mentioned three times.",1.0,182,walm
"walm -> repeat the previous color

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" is used in the sequence, the color associated with the word just before ""walm"" is repeated for the output of ""walm."" For example, if ""lug"" (which corresponds to the color blue) comes right before ""walm,"" the output for ""walm"" is also blue. Similarly, if ""zup"" (yellow) precedes ""walm,"" the output for ""walm"" is yellow again.",1.0,182,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and corresponding outputs in each example to identify patterns.

In all cases, the occurrence of ""walm"" seems to trigger the repeated output of the color that was previously mentioned until a new color is introduced or the sequence ends.

- In example 1, ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that the ""walm"" triggers repetition of ""blue.""
- In example 2, ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" again showing repetition, this time of the color ""yellow.""
- In example 3, after ""zup,"" the word ""walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" again triggers the repetition, here of the ""yellow"" following ""zup.""
- In example 4, ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red,"" reinforcing the pattern where ""walm"" triggers repetition of the color mentioned just before it.
- In example 5, ""lug walm"" once more corresponds to ""blue blue blue,"" consistent with the previous examples.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" appears to be a command for repetition of the color indicated directly before it.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color mentioned immediately before until a new color is introduced or the sequence ends.",0.9,182,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns in the input and output sequences to see how ""walm"" influences the result.

Looking closely, each time ""walm"" is present in the input, the corresponding output contains consecutive instances of the same color. Specifically, the consecutive color immediately following the word ""walm"" is the same as the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Let's go through each example:

1. lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
`lug` corresponds to `blue`, and after `walm`, we see `blue` repeated.

2. zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
`zup` corresponds to `yellow`, and after `walm`, we see `yellow` repeated.

3. zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
`zup` corresponds to `yellow`, and after `walm`, we see `yellow` repeated again.

4. zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
`wif` corresponds to `red`, and after `walm`, we see `red` repeated.

5. lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
`lug` corresponds to `blue`, and after `walm`, we see `blue` repeated.

Based on the patterns observed, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it indicates repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to be repeated in the output sequence.",0.9,182,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided. Specifically, we are looking for correlations between ""walm"" and the colors that are output after it. Here's what we can observe:

1. In the first example, ""lug walm wif zup wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue red yellow red"". ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and is followed by repeated ""blue"" in the output before a different color follows.

2. In the second example, ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red"". ""Walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and results in repeated ""yellow"" before a different color (""green"") is introduced.

3. In the third example, ""zup wif lug zup walm"" turns into ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"". After ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) again and results in repeated ""yellow"" in the output.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" converts to ""yellow yellow red red red"". ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) this time and leads to an output of repeated ""red"".

5. In the fifth example, just ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and the output is again repetitions of ""blue"".

From these observations, it appears that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the previous color until a new color word appears. 

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color that directly precedes it until a new color word ends the repetition.",0.8,182,walm
"Rule: lug -> blue

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""

"Observing the given examples and their respective outputs, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue,"" independent of its position within the sequence or the context of the surrounding words. The rule seems to be direct and unwavering.

"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the Output, regardless of the position in the Input sentence or the words surrounding it.",1.0,183,dax
"To figure out the rule for what ""dax"" represents, let's compare each input with its corresponding output:

- ""wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""red blue green""
- ""wif bluf dax lug"" corresponds to ""red red green blue""
- ""wif dax zup dax"" corresponds to ""red green yellow green""
- ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red""
- ""wif walm dax"" corresponds to ""red red red green""

There seems to be a pattern where ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" The other words consistently match up with the same colors (""wif"" with ""red,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" with either ""yellow"" or ""red"" depending on the position). Based on these examples, the rule appears to be that regardless of its position or what other words precede or follow it, ""dax"" is consistently represented by the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,183,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"". Each instance of the word ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output. The other words in the input seem to translate to other colors, with ""wif"" consistently translating to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". ""Walm"" does not have a direct translation in the first input but seems to translate to the same color as the word immediately preceding it. ""Bluf"" only appears once, and it translates to ""red"" in that instance, identical to the color that ""wif"" translates to.

Rule: dax -> ""green""",1.0,183,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"", we need to examine instances of ""dax"" within the given examples and identify the consistent pattern related to its appearance. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: wif lug dax → Output: red blue green
2. Input: wif bluf dax lug → Output: red red green blue
3. Input: wif dax zup dax → Output: red green yellow green
4. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif → Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
5. Input: wif walm dax → Output: red red red green

By inspecting these examples, we notice that every time the word ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green."" Moreover, ""dax"" does not seem to be dependent on the position or the surrounding words for its meaning. Thus, the word ""dax"" consistently correlates to the color ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green. ""Dax"" translates directly to the color ""green"" regardless of its position or surrounding words in the input.",1.0,183,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of ""dax"":

The output color for ""dax"" seems to depend on the immediately preceding word. Here's the pattern noticed in the examples:

- When preceded by ""wif,"" the output for ""dax"" is green.
- There is no example showing ""dax"" directly after ""bluf,"" but given the pattern, it could be hypothesized that if ""bluf"" were followed by ""dax,"" the color might be red (since the output for ""wif bluf dax lug"" is ""red red green blue"").
- Since ""walm"" precedes ""dax"" in the fourth and fifth examples, and the output immediately following ""walm"" is always yellow, it seems that regardless of the word that comes before ""walm,"" the color for ""walm"" remains yellow in the given examples. Nevertheless, ""dax"" following ""walm"" is green.
- No information is given in the examples about the output of ""dax"" following ""zup,"" as ""dax"" is not immediately preceded by ""zup"" in the output sequence; it's preceded by the color word ""yellow,"" which is the output corresponding to ""walm"" or ""zup."" However, the rule of ""dax"" producing green when following any word other than ""wif"" holds, as the output remains green even when ""dax"" follows ""zup.""

Given the apparent consistency, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" produces the output green when it follows any word, except for when it follows ""wif,"" which then it might be hypothesis that it will still return green. It's challenging to assert a more specific rule without further examples, particularly with ""dax"" following other words or standing alone. However, with the currently available data, the simplest induction is:

Rule: dax -> green (when following any word, possibly including ""wif"").",0.8,183,dax
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,183,wif
"Based on the provided examples, every instance of the nonce word ""wif"" directly corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output. No matter the context or position of ""wif"" within the input string, the output consistently includes ""red"" at the corresponding position. Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

wif -> ""red""

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".",1.0,183,wif
"Based on the given examples, the following pattern can be established:

- wif always results in the output ""red"".
- Other words in the input correspond to different specific colors in the output (e.g. dax -> green, lug -> blue). 
- The sequence of the colors in the output corresponds exactly with the sequence of words in the input.

Thus, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".",1.0,183,wif

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" is consistently translated to the color ""yellow,"" irrespective of its position within the sequence or the presence of other words. Therefore, ""zup"" has a direct and unchanging translation to a specific color.

"zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is always ""yellow."" Thus, ""zup"" translates to the meaning ""yellow.""",1.0,183,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the rule that ""zup"" is associated with a specific color in the output. Each time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. 

Considering this, the rule that can be induced from the given examples is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,183,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the presence of the word ""zup"" in an input sequence correlates with ""yellow"" in the output sequence. Whenever ""zup"" is present, it directly translates to ""yellow"" irrespective of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence.

Hence the rule appears to be:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,183,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the output color corresponds to the input word directly preceding the nonce word ""zup."" Here is the observed correspondence:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""zup,"" the output is yellow.
- When ""walm"" precedes ""zup,"" the output is red.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""zup,"" the output is red.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""zup,"" the output is blue.
- When ""zup"" stands alone or is preceded by ""bluf,"" the output is yellow.

Given this, it seems that ""zup"" triggers the output of a color that is associated with the word immediately before it, with possibly a default behavior of outputting ""yellow"" when it is the first word or follows an unrecognized word. However, it's notable that in the provided examples, ""wif"" and ""walm"" lead to the same output color, implying that they may be substitutable in this specific context, or that ""zup"" may not differentiate between certain inputs.

In the second example, it is not entirely clear why ""wif zup wif"" results in ""red yellow red""—whether ""zup"" examines only the first ""wif"" or also affects the ""wif"" following it. Since the instructions are to deduce what ""zup"" means based only on the given examples, we'll focus on the direct correlations observed.

Rule: ""zup"" outputs a color based on the word immediately before it—yellow for ""dax,"" red for ""walm"" or ""wif,"" blue for ""lug,"" and defaults to yellow when it is the first word or follows an unrecognized word.

zup -> meaning. The meaning of ""zup"" is a color-indicating function that depends on the context of the preceding word, with a default output of yellow.",0.9,183,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the given examples and their respective outputs. 

1. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax

3. Input: wif bluf zup
   Output: red red yellow
   
4. Input: lug bluf

5. Input: dax wif bluf

From the examples, we can deduce the following color associations for the other words:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Since ""bluf"" in each case yields a color output that matches the color output immediately preceding it, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it outputs the same color as the word right before it.

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Rule: `bluf` repeats the color of the previous word.",1.0,183,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze each input/output pair.

1. Input: ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" — Output: ""green green red yellow green""

2. Input: ""zup wif bluf"" — Output: ""yellow red red""
   Here, ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

3. Input: ""wif bluf zup"" — Output: ""red red yellow""

4. Input: ""lug bluf"" — Output: ""blue blue""
   Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

5. Input: ""dax wif bluf"" — Output: ""green red red""
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Looking at all the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color corresponding to the word that precedes it. Let's confirm this with the cases we have:

- In the first input, ""dax bluf"" turns into ""green green,"" so ""bluf"" is the same as the color of ""dax"" (green).
- In the second and third inputs, ""wif bluf"" turns into ""red red,"" so ""bluf"" is the same as the color of ""wif"" (red).
- In the fourth input, ""lug bluf"" turns into ""blue blue,"" so ""bluf"" is the same as the color of ""lug"" (blue).

Given this pattern, we can write the rule for ""bluf"" as follows:

"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to be transforming into the word ""red"". Whenever ""bluf"" is used within the input, the corresponding output is ""red"". Therefore, we can deduce that the nonce word ""bluf"" is associated with the color red.

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to consider the examples provided and identify any patterns based on the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

1. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
   Output: green green red yellow green

2. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red

3. Input: wif bluf zup
   Output: red red yellow

4. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue

5. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red

Looking at the examples, we can try to match the inputs to the outputs:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when it appears in the first and last position (Example 1).
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" (Examples 2 and 3).
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" (Examples 2, 3, and 5).
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" (Example 4).

Now when we look at ""bluf"" across all examples, the outputs immediately following it are all ""red,"" except for Example 4, where it is ""blue,"" but it is followed by the word ""lug,"" which also corresponds to ""blue.""

Thus we can deduce: When ""bluf"" comes before a word of a known color, the output is the color associated with the following word. In cases where ""bluf"" is the last word or doesn't precede a word with a known color association, it seems to default to ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the immediately following word or defaults to ""red"" if no such word follows.",0.8,183,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in the given examples and their corresponding outputs.

Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
Output: green green red yellow green

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

Input: wif bluf zup
Output: red red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red

By examining the inputs and their respective outputs, we can make the following observations:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output for ""bluf"" is red. Example: ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green red.""
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output for ""bluf"" is red. Example: ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red.""
3. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output for ""bluf"" is red. Example: ""zup wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow red red"" (the first red corresponding to ""wif"" and the second red corresponding to ""bluf"").
4. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output for ""bluf"" is blue. Example: ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue.""

Based on these observations, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates to the same color as the word preceding it, except when that word is ""wif,"" ""zup,"" or ""dax,"" in which case ""bluf"" always translates to red. The word ""wif"" itself translates to red, which provides insight for the cases involving ""dax"" and ""zup,"" as ""bluf"" following them might be carrying over the red from the previous word ""wif.""

Given the limitations of the examples, we cannot confirm with absolute certainty the rule when ""bluf"" is preceded by any word. Therefore, we could tentatively form the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> translates to the color red when it follows ""wif,"" ""zup,"" or ""dax;"" otherwise, translates to the same color as the word before it.",0.8,183,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to cause the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here is how the rule applies to each example:

- Input: dax walm wif
  Output: green green green red
  Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it repeats ""green."" ""Wif"" then changes the output to ""red"".

- Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
  Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
  ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""bluf"" is still ""blue"", ""dax"" changes to ""green"", ""zup"" changes to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" makes the output repeat ""yellow"". Finally, ""lug"" changes it back to ""blue"".

- Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
  Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
  ""Lug"" is ""blue"", ""bluf"" is ""blue"", ""wif"" changes to ""red"", and then ""walm"" follows ""wif"" resulting in repeating ""red"". ""Lug"" changes it back to ""blue"".

- Input: lug walm zup wif
  Output: blue blue blue yellow red
  ""Lug"" is ""blue"", ""walm"" follows and repeats ""blue"", ""zup"" changes to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" turns it to ""red"".

- Input: dax walm
  Output: green green green
  ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""walm"" follows ""dax"" repeating ""green"".

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word.",1.0,183,walm
"Based on the examples provided, each word appears to correspond with a specific color:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> blue

In each example, where ""walm"" is present, the word preceding it is repeated in the output in the form of its corresponding color. Therefore, ""walm"" seems to function as an instruction to repeat the color of the preceding word one or more times depending on the context.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word that comes before ""walm"".",1.0,183,walm
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to result in the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the last mentioned color.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word.",1.0,183,walm
"Observing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, it appears that ""walm"" has a rule associated with its color representation, which is dependent on the preceding word. Let's examine the examples to deduce the rule:

1. In ""dax walm wif"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"", and the output is ""green green green red"". ""Dax"" is represented by green, and the ""walm"" that follows it also outputs green. 

2. In ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"", ""walm"" follows ""zup"", and the output is ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". ""Zup"" is represented by yellow, and the ""walm"" that follows it also outputs yellow.

3. In ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"", ""walm"" follows ""wif"", and the output is ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"". ""Wif"" is represented by red, and the ""walm"" that follows it also outputs red.

4. In ""lug walm zup wif"", ""walm"" follows ""lug"", and the output is ""blue blue blue yellow red"". ""Lug"" is represented by blue, and the ""walm"" that follows it also outputs blue.

5. In ""dax walm"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"", and the output is ""green green green"". ""Dax"" is represented by green, and the ""walm"" that follows it also outputs green.

From these examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes on the color representation of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: walm -> Takes the color representation of the preceding word.",1.0,183,walm
"walm -> meaning. Analyzing the examples provided, we observe the following:

- In the first example, the output sequence is ""green green green red"" which corresponds to the input sequence ""dax walm wif"". Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"", and the output for ""wif"" is red. Since the third ""green"" corresponds to the ""walm"" (as ""dax"" corresponds to the first two ""green"" outputs), we can infer that ""walm"" might mean ""green"" as well.

- In the second example, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"", the output is ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". The word ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow"". Since ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and appears both before and after ""walm"", this gives the impression that ""walm"" maintains the color of the word before it, translating to ""yellow"" in this case.

- The third example, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"", gives us ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"". ""walm"" is at the second to last position, followed by ""lug"" which is ""blue"". Since the output of ""walm"" in this case is ""red"", it again seems to maintain the color of the previous unique word, which was ""wif"" meaning ""red"".

- The fourth example, ""lug walm zup wif"", correlates with ""blue blue blue yellow red"". Here, ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" (""blue"") and before ""zup"" (""yellow""), and translates to ""blue"" again, matching the color of the word before it.

- Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax walm"", the output is ""green green green"". ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (""green"") and there is no color change indicated in the output.

Based on these observations, it appears that ""walm"" acts as a repeater of the color of the previous unique word (not counting repeated words like ""lug lug""). In cases where ""walm"" is at the end of a sequence, there is no previous color to change, so it retains the color associated with ""dax"".

Rule: walm translates to the color of the preceding non-repeated word in the input sequence. If ""walm"" is the second word and follows ""dax"", it means ""green"".",0.9,183,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" we'll look at the pattern of its placement and the corresponding outputs.

1. dax lug wif -> green blue red
2. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
3. wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue
4. zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow green blue
5. lug dax -> blue green

From these examples, we can observe the following:

- Whenever ""lug"" appears, the word ""blue"" is part of the output.
- The position of ""lug"" in the input does not directly correspond to the position of ""blue"" in the output.
- ""lug"" does not always precede or follow the same word, yet ""blue"" appears consistently.

Considering these observations, it seems that ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the list of words. Therefore, we can infer that ""lug"" means blue.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,184,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,184,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" Each input example includes ""lug,"" and each output contains the word ""blue."" However, the placement of ""lug"" within the inputs does not follow a consistent pattern in relation to where ""blue"" appears in the outputs, which suggests that ""lug"" might mean ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sentence. It is not dependent on any other adjacent words.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,184,lug
"To figure out the meaning of the word ""lug,"" let's compare the examples and their corresponding outputs:

Input 1: dax lug wif
Output 1: green blue red

Input 2: wif bluf lug zup
Output 2: red red blue yellow

Input 3: wif bluf dax lug
Output 3: red red green blue

Input 4: zup walm dax lug
Output 4: yellow yellow yellow green blue

Input 5: lug dax
Output 5: blue green

To deduce the rule for ""lug,"" we look for the consistent element in the output whenever ""lug"" appears in the input.

In Output 1, ""lug"" precedes ""wif"" and ""blue"" precedes ""red"" in the result.
In Output 2, ""lug"" follows ""bluf"" and ""blue"" follows ""red"" in the result.
In Output 3, ""lug"" is at the end, and ""blue"" is at the end in the result.
In Output 4, ""lug"" is at the end again, and ""blue"" is at the end again in the result.
In Output 5, ""lug"" precedes ""dax,"" and ""blue"" precedes ""green"" in the result.

The rule seems to be that ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" It does not appear dependent on position or other context from the provided examples.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,184,lug
"By examining the patterns between the input and output pairs, we can observe the consistent presence of the word ""lug"" and its associated color in the output. Here are the observations:

- In each instance where ""lug"" appears, the color ""blue"" is part of the output.
- Additionally, when ""dax"" follows ""lug,"" the color ""green"" follows the color ""blue"" in the output. This is indicated in the first and third examples.
- When ""lug"" appears at the beginning or middle of the input sequence, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, and when ""dax"" is present in the sequence, ""green"" is also in the output.
- The final example is particularly telling: ""lug dax"" translates directly to ""blue green,"" confirming that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green"" when they are adjacent.

- When ""bluf"" is the last word following any word that is not ""wif"", the output color is blue (Example 2) or yellow if it immediately follows ""zup"" (Examples 3 and 5).
- However, when ""bluf"" follows ""lug zup"", the output color is also yellow (Example 4).

The variability of the output color for ""bluf"" seems highly dependent on its preceding word(s), so there does not appear to be a consistent one-to-one mapping to a single color for the word ""bluf"".

However, if we look closely at the examples 3, 4, and 5 where ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output color is always yellow. It's possible to deduce a rule in this specific context.

Rule: When ""bluf"" immediately follows ""zup"", its output color is yellow.

According to this rule, we can induce:

bluf -> meaning. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the meaning is yellow.",0.8,185,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" from the examples provided, we need to analyze the surrounding words and their corresponding color outputs. Let's examine each input and its output, looking for patterns:

1. Input: ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" -> Output: ""green green red yellow green""
2. Input: ""dax zup lug bluf"" -> Output: ""green yellow blue blue""
3. Input: ""dax zup bluf"" -> Output: ""green yellow yellow""
4. Input: ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" -> Output: ""green yellow blue yellow yellow""
5. Input: ""dax zup bluf"" -> Output: ""green yellow yellow""

The first thing to note is that ""dax"" is consistently mapped to ""green"". Since ""bluf"" corresponds to different colors in different contexts, its meaning is likely dependent on a rule based on the context rather than mapping to a specific fixed color.

In the first input, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""zup"", which correspond to ""red"" and ""yellow"", respectively. However, the output color for ""bluf"" is ""green"".

In the second input, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", which maps to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" itself also maps to ""blue"".

In the third and fifth inputs, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", mapping to ""yellow"", and accordingly, ""bluf"" itself also maps to ""yellow"".

In the fourth input, ""bluf"" again follows ""zup"", which maps to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" also maps to ""yellow"".

From these observations, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes on the color of the preceding word (excluding ""dax” since it consistently maps to ""green""). However, when the preceding word is ""wif"", ""bluf"" maps to ""green"", which might be because ""dax"", which maps to green, appears both before and after ""bluf wif zup"".

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Takes the color of the word immediately preceding it, but if the sequence is ""dax bluf wif"", then ""bluf"" is ""green"", potentially due to the influence of ""dax"" being green before and after the sequence.",0.8,185,bluf
"Examining the inputs and their respective outputs:

1. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
   Output: green green red yellow green
   
2. Input: dax zup lug bluf
   Output: green yellow blue blue
   
3. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   
4. Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
   Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
   
5. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

It appears the color corresponds to a certain word based on its position and/or repetition:

- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when it follows ""dax"", but when it appears for the second time in sequence, it still translates to ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"".
- ""wif"" translates to ""red"" (though we only see it once, so we can’t be sure it’s always ""red"").
  
Now, let's determine what ""bluf"" corresponds to, being mindful that a single example may not necessarily prove a rule:

- In examples 1 and 4, ""bluf"" is the last word and translates to ""red"" in the first case and ""yellow"" in the second case, suggesting its color is not fixed.
- In examples 2, 3, and 5 ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and translates to ""blue"" in example 2 and ""yellow"" in examples 3 and 5.

Considering these observations, it seems ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that the previous word represents. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" ""bluf"" is also ""green."" When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which correlates with ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" is ""yellow."" In example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" is also ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color value of the word it immediately follows.",0.8,185,bluf
Rule: 'bluf' -> yellow,0.4,185,bluf
"Observing the examples provided, we can determine that each word corresponds to a specific color in the outputs. Here's the list of word-color associations based on the examples:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Now, we can look at the instances of ""walm"" and note the color that corresponds to its position in the output:

- In the first example, ""dax walm wif zup"" corresponds to ""green green green red yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" here is represented by ""green.""
- In the second example, ""dax walm wif"" corresponds to ""green green green red,"" where again ""walm"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In the third example, ""dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue,"" indicating ""walm"" is ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif walm dax zup"" corresponds to ""red red red green yellow,"" where ""walm"" is ""red.""
- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" making ""walm"" ""yellow.""

The examples show a pattern that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it:

- When following ""dax"" (green), ""walm"" is green.
- When following ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" is blue.
- When following ""wif"" (red), ""walm"" is red.
- When following ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" is yellow.

Thus, the rule for the meaning of ""walm"" appears to be that it adopts the color associated with the word that comes directly before it.

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,185,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it can be observed that the output color changes with the inclusion of the nonce word ""walm"". 

1. In the first example, ""dax walm wif zup"" translates to ""green green green red yellow"". When ""walm"" appears after ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"", it causes the next color to be ""green"" as well, thereby repeating the color corresponding to ""dax"".

2. In the second example, ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red"", here again showing that ""walm"" repeats the color that corresponds to ""dax"".

3. The third example, ""dax lug walm"", where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", shows that after including ""walm"", it outputs ""blue"" repeatedly for the position where ""walm"" is.

4. The fourth example, ""wif walm dax zup,"" translates to ""red red red green yellow"". Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" repeats the red color.

5. Finally, the fifth example ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"", with ""walm"" resulting in repeated ""yellow"" from ""zup"".

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the previous word to be repeated for its position. If no word precedes ""walm"", then it repeats its own corresponding color.

Putting it all together:

walm -> meaning: ""walm"" means to repeat the color output of the preceding word or its own if there's no preceding word.

Rule: Repeat the color of the preceding word in the output sequence.",1.0,185,walm
"walm -> repeat the color of the previous word. 

Rule: When the word 'walm' is used after another word, it takes on the color associated with the previous word and applies that color to the subsequent words until a new color word is encountered. For instance, after 'dax' (which is associated with the color green), 'walm' causes the following words to also be green until a new color word appears in the sequence.",1.0,185,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we need to examine the common factor that is associated with the presence of the word ""walm"" in all examples and the color sequence it produces.

Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

In the first two examples, the presence of ""walm"" after ""dax"" changes the initial ""green"" output associated with ""dax"" to a series of ""green"" outputs corresponding to the number of words following ""dax"" up to but not including ""wif."" The word ""wif"" itself is associated with ""red."" 

In the next example:

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Here, ""lug"" is typically associated with ""blue,"" and ""dax"" with ""green."" However, the presence of ""walm"" changes the output to a sequence of ""blue"" (associated with ""lug"") until the sequence is complete.

The fourth example:

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

In this case, the first word is ""wif,"" which is associated with ""red,"" and the following ""walm"" ensures that the next word (""dax"") doesn't produce its typical ""green"" but rather continues the ""red"" pattern until ""zup,"" which returns the output to ""yellow."" 

Finally:

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""zup"" typically is associated with ""yellow,"" and again, the presence of ""walm"" immediately after extends the ""yellow"" pattern through the sequence.

So, it seems that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the output color of the word immediately preceding it, for as many words as follow ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the previous word for the number of words that follow.",0.9,185,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the consistent patterns in the provided examples.

- In the first example, ""dax walm wif zup,"" the output sequence is ""green green green red yellow."" We can observe that each word corresponds to a color, and the pattern suggests that the presence of ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color that comes just before it.

- In the second example, ""dax walm wif,"" which removes ""zup"" from the first example, the output remains consistent with the pattern, dropping only the last color, ""yellow,"" associated with ""zup.""

- In the third example, ""dax lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" we again see a repetition of the color associated with the word right before ""walm.""

- In the fourth example, ""wif walm dax zup,"" the output is ""red red red green yellow."" Once more, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the previous word, which is ""red"" in this case, corresponding to ""wif.""

- In the last example, ""zup walm,"" we see ""yellow yellow yellow"" as the output, which indicates that ""walm"" causes a triple repetition of the color ""yellow,"" which is associated with ""zup.""

Based on these patterns, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: ""walm"" causes the output color to be repeated for the number of times it is expected to occur after the previous word. If it's at the end of the input, it repeats the color of the preceding word three times. If it is placed between two words, it repeats the color corresponding to the word before it until a different word appears.",0.8,185,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each instance of ""lug"" corresponds uniformly to the word ""blue.""

Rule: dax -> green,1.0,186,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,186,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the input and output provided in the examples:

1. Input: wif
   Output: red

2. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red

3. Input: wif
   Output: red

4. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

5. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue

From the first and third examples, it's clear that the word ""wif"" on its own corresponds to ""red.""

In the second example, when ""wif"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green red."" Here, ""dax"" precedes ""wif"" and results in an extra color (""green"") added before ""red.""

In the fourth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and ""dax,"" and after that is ""walm."" The outputs are two ""red,"" then one ""green,"" and finally two more ""green."" The presence of ""bluf"" after ""wif"" results in an additional ""red,"" while ""dax"" brings in ""green,"" and ""walm"" seems to output two ""green.""

Lastly, for the fifth example, ""wif bluf lug"" translates to ""red red blue."" Here again, ""bluf"" adds an additional ""red,"" while ""lug"" changes the pattern to blue.

From these observations, it's apparent that ""wif"" directly corresponds to the color ""red."" However, the meaning of ""wif"" might not change, but its output might be influenced by the preceding or following words, which signal the addition of other colors or perhaps the transformation of the output sequence.

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" However, the sequence of colors in the output can be modified by the presence of certain words before or after ""wif"" in the input.",1.0,186,wif

Here is the pattern observed:

- 'wif' by itself leads to 'red'.
- 'dax' present in the input results in 'green' in the output.
- 'bluf' present in the input results in 'red blue' (since 'wif' is also present in all provided examples with 'bluf' and 'wif' corresponds to 'red').
- 'lug' correlates with 'blue' when present with 'wif'.
- 'walm' has not been shown alone and always follows the word 'dax'; hence it seems to continue the color pattern started by 'dax', resulting in two additional 'green' outputs.

With these observations, the rule for 'wif' is consistent and does not seem to be affected by context; it is always mapped to 'red'.

- ""dax"" is always followed by ""green"",
- ""zup"" is always followed by ""yellow"",
- ""wif"" leads to ""red"",
- ""lug"" leads to ""blue"".

It seems the color output is directly related to the specific nonce word present in the input, without regard to the position of the word within the sequence. Since ""bluf"" consistently results in ""green"" every time it appears, we can induce that ""bluf"" means ""green"".

Rule: bluf -> green,1.0,186,bluf
"Based on the examples provided:

- When 'bluf' follows 'dax zup', the respective output colors are 'green yellow yellow'. 
- When 'bluf' follows 'wif dax', the output for 'dax bluf' is 'green green'. This is identical for the standalone 'dax bluf'.
- When 'bluf' follows 'lug', the output is 'blue blue green', but for the 'bluf' following 'dax' which follows 'lug', it is 'green'.
- In another instance of 'dax zup bluf', the output is 'green yellow yellow' consistent with the first example.
- In the case of 'dax bluf' alone, the output is 'green green'.

From these examples, we can deduce that 'dax' consistently results in 'green'. However 'bluf' seems to be yielding 'green' when it follows 'dax', but 'yellow' when it follows 'zup' after 'dax'. When 'bluf' follows 'lug', the output for 'bluf' is also 'green', indicating that 'lug' might not influence the color that 'bluf' represents.

Therefore, 'bluf' has a consistent output of 'green' when following 'dax' or 'lug', and a 'yellow' when following 'zup'. Given the consistency across examples, it appears that 'bluf' is contextually dependent but has a baseline output color of 'green', with an exception when it closely follows 'zup'.

3. lug bluf dax bluf -> blue blue green green
4. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
5. dax bluf -> green green

From the first and the fourth example, we can see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

In the second example, ""wif"" must correspond to ""red"" because we already know that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so the remaining word ""wif"" must correspond to the remaining color ""red.""

In the third example, ""lug"" must correspond to ""blue"" because the pattern ""bluf dax bluf"" corresponds to ""blue green green."" Since we already confirmed ""dax"" as ""green,"" ""bluf"" must be ""blue.""

From the fifth example and consistent with the third example, ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green."" Since ""dax"" is ""green,"" this confirms that ""bluf"" is ""green.""

Rule:
bluf -> green",0.8,186,bluf
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word(s) the same number of times as there are syllables in the previous word(s).

Explanation:

In each output, ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the previous word or words. The number of times the color is repeated corresponds to the number of syllables in the prior word(s):

1. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and because ""wif"" has one syllable, ""walm"" results in ""red"" being repeated three times.

2. ""zup walm lug wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red""
""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and has one syllable, so ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

3. ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red""
Here ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" with one syllable, so ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times.

4. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" -> ""blue red yellow red red red""
In this case, ""wif"" is the word that occurs just before ""walm,"" which corresponds to ""red"" and has one syllable, thus ""walm"" results in three ""red""s.

5. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
""Dax lug"" has two words before ""walm"" with one syllable each, resulting in the previous color, ""blue,"" being repeated four times (once for ""dax"" and three times for ""walm"").

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to be a command that repeats the color of the previous word, the number of repetitions corresponding to the number of syllables in that word, plus two additional repetitions.",1.0,186,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color word that directly precedes it. Here is how we can deduce this:

- Example 1: ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red"". ""Wif"" results in ""red,"" and since ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" it generates two more ""red.""
- Example 2: ""zup walm lug wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow blue red"". Here, ""zup"" produces ""yellow,"" then ""walm"" repeats the color ""yellow"" two more times. ""Lug wif"" then produce ""blue red"" as expected.
- Example 3: ""lug wif walm"" outputs ""blue red red red"". ""Lug"" gives ""blue,"" ""wif"" gives ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""red"" two more times.
- Example 4: ""lug wif zup wif walm"" outputs ""blue red yellow red red red"". Following the same logic, ""walm"" repeats the ""red"" produced by the preceding ""wif"" two more times.
- Example 5: ""dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue blue blue"". Here, ""dax"" gives ""green,"" ""lug"" gives ""blue,"" and ""walm"" then repeats ""blue"" two more times.

Rule:
walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" means to repeat the color word directly before it two additional times.",1.0,186,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" results in the output of a sequence of the color that precedes it. When dissecting the patterns:

- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red""
- ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red""

In these cases, the color immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times.

- ""zup walm lug wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red""
- ""lug wif zup wif walm"" results in ""blue red yellow red red red""

The rule appears to be consistent: ""walm"" causes the output of the immediate color preceding it to be repeated three times, regardless of what other words or colors are present.

- ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue""

Again, in this example, the color immediately preceding ""walm"" is “blue” and is output three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word immediately before ""walm"" three times.",1.0,186,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by looking at the patterns in the input and their corresponding output.

Input: wif walm  
Output: red red red  
In this case, the presence of ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the nonce word before it.

Input: zup walm lug wif  
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red  
Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which is associated with the color yellow, and ""walm"" results in a repetition of yellow.

Input: lug wif walm  
Output: blue red red red  
Again, ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it, which is ""wif"" associated with red.

Input: lug wif zup wif walm  
Output: blue red yellow red red red  
Just like the previous examples, ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" and results in a repetition of the red color.

Input: dax lug walm  
Output: green blue blue blue  
In this case, ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" which is associated with blue and causes a repetition of blue.

Walm -> meaning. Rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" repeats the color output associated with the immediately preceding nonce word as many times as the total number of words (including ""walm"") after the last incidence of the color.",1.0,186,walm
"To deduce the meaning or rules governing the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the given examples. Here's what we can observe:

1. Each time ""walm"" is used, the color ""red"" is repeated in the output.
2. The number of times ""red"" is repeated seems to depend on the position of ""walm"" within the input sequence.

Analyzing the patterns:

- In the first example with just ""wif walm,"" the output is ""red red red,"" which suggests that ""wif"" might correspond to one instance of ""red"" and ""walm"" to two instances since there are three reds in total.
- In the second example, ""zup walm lug wif"" outputs one yellow, followed by three reds and one blue, which supports the idea that ""walm"" corresponds to multiple reds as there is one ""wif"" contributing one red, and then ""walm"" seems to add more reds.
- The third example again shows that the number of reds increases with the presence of ""walm.""
- The fourth example reinforces that ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to ""wif"" because ""wif"" is repeated once before ""walm,"" and after the nonce word, we see a repeat of ""red"" for each prior occurrence.
- The fifth example, ""dax lug walm,"" outputs one green, followed by three blues, which is the only sequence without ""wif,"" yet ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word before it, which in this case is ""lug.""

From these observations, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word in the input sequence as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the sequence.

For example, if ""walm"" is the second word, its corresponding color is repeated twice. If it's the third word, its corresponding color is repeated three times, and so on. Thus:

"lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,187,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,187,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" This is observed by looking at the position of ""dax"" in the input and the corresponding color in the output. For instance, in the first example, ""dax"" is the first word in the input and ""green"" is the first color in the output. 

In every example, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence, it consistently translates to ""green"" in the output sequence:

- In the first example, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug wif walm"" and translates to ""green blue red red red"".
- In the second and fourth examples, ""dax"" occurs next to ""wif"" and ""lug"" correspondingly and in both instances, ""green"" follows.
- In the third example, ""dax"" is the last in a sequence before ""lug"" appears again after which ""green blue"" follows.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" is followed by ""zup lug wif zup"" translating to ""green yellow blue red yellow.""

Therefore, the rule derived from these examples is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,187,dax
"Rule: dax -> green. 

Each English word in the input is consistently translated to a color in the output. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in each given example.",1.0,187,dax
"Given the examples provided, we can try to determine the rule that dictates what the nonce word ""dax"" means. By examining each example, we'll assess the output that corresponds to the input, and attempt to find a pattern linked specifically to the appearance of ""dax"".

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: dax zup lug wif zup
Output: green yellow blue red yellow

Analyzing the examples:
- In every instance, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
- No other word seems to translate to ""green.""

From this, we can induce a simple rule:

Rule: ""dax"" translates to ""green"".

So, dax -> green.",1.0,187,dax
"Given the examples, the word ""dax"" seems to correspond to a color. To determine the specific color that ""dax"" represents, let's look at the instances where ""dax"" occurs and the corresponding output color:

1. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red
2. wif dax wif -> red green red
3. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
4. lug dax -> blue green
5. dax zup lug wif zup -> green yellow blue red yellow

From the above examples, we can observe that every time the word ""dax"" appears, the output color is ""green."" There is no example given which contradicts this observation.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,187,dax
"Based on the examples provided:

- Whenever dax is followed by lug, the output is green followed by blue.
- When dax stands alone or initiates a sequence, it results in green.
- dax followed by a different word other than lug results in green, and the other words correspond to specific colors.

From these observations, we can deduce that dax translates to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,187,dax
Rule: wif -> red.,1.0,187,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word 'wif' seems to consistently correspond to the color 'red.' Each occurrence of 'wif' translates to 'red' in the output, regardless of its position in the input string or the other words that accompany it.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,187,wif
"Reviewing the provided examples, we can attempt to infer the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" by looking at the corresponding outputs for various inputs.

From the first example:
Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
We can see that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""bluf"" also to ""red"", and ""dax"" to ""green"".

In the second example:
Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
Here ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red"".

In the third example:
Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
We can see ""wif"" equals ""red"", ""walm"" also equals ""red"", and ""dax"" remains ""green"".

The fourth example reinforces the rule with longer input:
Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red
Each ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""walm"" to ""red"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"".

The fifth example provides yet another confirmation:
Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" again is ""red"".

Based on all of the above examples, the rule we can deduce is that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". There is a 1:1 direct match between the appearance of ""wif"" and the output of ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,187,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we can analyze the commonality between the inputs and the corresponding outputs.

- In every instance where ""wif"" occurs, the color ""red"" occurs in the output.
- The number of times ""wif"" occurs in the input corresponds to the number of ""red"" occurrences in the output.
- There are no exceptions to this pattern across the provided examples.

Therefore, the rule associated with ""wif"" is that it translates to the color red in the output.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,187,wif
"Based on the given examples, each occurrence of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the output of the color ""red."" Therefore, the rule seems to be a direct correlation between ""wif"" and this specific color output, irrespective of the position of ""wif"" in the input or the other words present.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,187,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word directly translates to a specific color. Here's a breakdown of the words and their corresponding color outputs:

- ""walm"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""green""
- ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow"" in every output

Considering this, and that ""zup"" is always resulting in the color ""yellow"" no matter the position it is used in the sentence, the rule appears to be as follows:

zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,187,zup
"Based on the presented examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output regardless of its position within the input sequence or the other words present. Therefore, I induce the following rule for the meaning of ""zup"":

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,187,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. This relationship is consistent across all examples. Also, it seems that other words may correspond to their respective colors as well, as indicated by the repeated patterns.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the word preceding bluf.

"Based on the examples given:

- ""lug wif lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red blue blue""
- ""lug bluf wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue red""
- ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" corresponds to ""red red blue green red""
- ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow""
- ""dax walm wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green green green red red""

It appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to repeating the color word that appears right before it. So when ""bluf"" appears after a color word, it repeats that color in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color word that appears right before ""bluf"".",1.0,187,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when followed by ""lug"", and it seems to echo the color of the word immediately preceding it when it is not following ""lug"". This is evident since ""bluf"" becomes ""blue"" after ""lug"" (which is ""blue""), and it becomes ""red"" when following ""wif"" (which is ""red""). When ""bluf"" is immediately after ""zup"" (which is ""yellow""), it is also ""yellow"", reinforcing this pattern. Therefore, ""bluf"" adopts the color of the preceding word except in the specific case when it follows ""lug""; in such cases, it becomes ""red"". 

From the examples:

- In ""lug wif lug bluf"", ""bluf"" is ""blue"" because it follows ""lug"", which uniquely changes ""bluf"" to ""red"" but since it was already ""blue"", it remains ""blue"".
- In ""lug bluf wif"", ""bluf"" is ""blue"" because it follows ""lug"" but does not change color due to following ""lug"" directly.
- In ""wif bluf lug dax wif"", ""bluf"" is ""red"" because it follows ""wif"" (which is ""red"").
- In ""zup bluf"", ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" because it follows ""zup"" (which is ""yellow"").
- In ""dax walm wif bluf"", ""bluf"" is ""red"" because it follows ""wif"" (which is ""red"").

Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> the same color as the word immediately before it, except when the preceding word is ""lug"", which causes ""bluf"" to echo the color of ""lug"" (except when directly following ""lug"").

Observations:

1. Every time the word ""dax"" is mentioned, the word ""green"" appears in the output at the respective position. This suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
2. The word ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow,"" since it appears before a ""yellow"" in the output.
3. The word ""walm"" may be tricky as it appears twice after ""dax"" but before ""zup"" and is followed by ""green"" in the output. However, based on the input ""dax walm"" and its output ""green green green"", it seems that ""walm"" also corresponds to ""green"".

5. When ""bluf"" appears, the next word (if ""bluf"" is not the last word) is repeated in the translation according to its respective color. If there is no subsequent word, then ""bluf"" takes on the color ""yellow,"" which is the color associated with the first word in the sequence.

For example, in the first input ""zup bluf wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" comes before ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" and there's another ""bluf"" at the end, which should be ""yellow"" because it's the last word and there are no more words to repeat.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each unique word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. Therefore, to discern the meaning of ""bluf"" we will examine each instance of ""bluf"" and its corresponding color in the output.

In the first example:

- ""zup bluf wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red""
- Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red"".

In the second example:

- ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" translates to ""yellow red red yellow blue""
- Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" which conflicts with the first example. 

Given that we have conflicting information for ""bluf"" from these two examples, let’s proceed to the other examples to find any consistent rule that might explain this discrepancy.

In the third example:

- ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue""
- Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" once again, corroborating the first example but conflicting with the second.

In the fourth example:

- ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue red green green red""
- In this case, ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""green"".

In the fifth example:

- ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow red green red yellow""
- Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" again, agreeing with the first and third examples but conflicting with the second and fourth.

Considering the consistency of the first, third, and fifth examples where ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" which results in ""yellow yellow,"" the rule seems to be dependent on a specific context. The shared context after the ""bluf"" is ""wif"" which translates to ""red"" consistently.

Taking a closer look, we can see that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word preceding it. In the first, third, and fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow"") and thus ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow."" In the second example, however, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (which translates as ""red""), and ""bluf"" takes on the same color, ""red."" 

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

bluf -> meaning: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: ""bluf"" matches the color of the preceding word in the string. If ""zup"" (yellow) precedes ""bluf"", then ""bluf"" is ""yellow"". If ""wif"" (red) precedes ""bluf"", then ""bluf"" is ""red"", and so on.",1.0,188,bluf

- In the fourth example, ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax,"" the color before walm is blue, so blue is repeated three times as a result of walm.

Thus: walm -> repeat the preceding color three times.",1.0,188,walm
"To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word 'walm', we should look for patterns in the examples provided.

In the first example:
Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
Here, 'walm' is preceded by 'wif' and followed by 'dax', and the output gives us three reds and a green. 'wif' contributes one red, and 'dax' contributes one green.

In the second example:
Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
Here, 'walm' is between 'zup' and 'dax', and the output has an additional three yellows besides the other colors related to the other words. Notably, the colors associated with 'wif' and 'dax' remain consistent, suggesting that 'walm' is responsible for the three yellows.

In the third example:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
In this instance, 'walm' follows 'lug', and the output is three blues. Since 'lug' does not appear with other words in the examples to compare, we can't attribute all three blues to 'lung' because 'walm' is also present.

In the fourth example:
Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
Here, 'lug' and 'walm' appear together again, and we see the three blues, which would support the notion that 'walm' contributes to these blue elements. The presence of 'wif', 'bluf', and 'dax' does not alter the pattern we observed.

In the fifth example:
Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
Here 'wif' precedes 'walm' followed by 'lug', so 'wif' provides one red, and likely 'lug' provides the blue at the end. Thus the three reds in a row would be tied to 'wif' and 'walm'.

Considering the colors that are repeated in each output wherein 'walm' is used, it appears that 'walm' contributes three of the same colors following the other color contributions of the preceding word. Therefore, based on the examples given, we can deduce the following rule for 'walm':

Rule: 'walm' results in three repetitions of the color output associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Hence, the rule:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: 'walm' triggers an output of three consecutive colors that match the color associated with the word directly before 'walm'.",0.9,188,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can look at the patterns involving walm and its corresponding output.

- In every instance, ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of the same color.
- The color seems to be dependent on the word that precedes ""walm.""

Analyzing the examples:

1. ""wif"" before ""walm"" leads to the output being ""red red red.""
2. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
3. The word ""dax"" before ""walm"" isn't followed by any color, indicating ""dax"" might be acting as a color reset or a different function.
4. If ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the color output is ""yellow"" (In the last example, ""zup"" is not directly before ""walm"" and there is no yellow sequence).

Based on the examples given, ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of the color represented by the word immediately before it.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is: walm -> meaning: ""Repeat the color that corresponds to the preceding word.""

Rule: If a word is followed by ""walm,"" the corresponding output color for that word is repeated three times. If the preceding word is ""dax,"" it acts as a reset or a different function and isn’t followed by a color in the output.",0.9,188,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" influences the color produced in the output. Observing the pattern, each instance of ""walm"" results in consecutive red outputs, with the number of reds equal to the position of ""walm"" in the input string.

Let's analyze the given examples to define the rule:

1. Input: ""wif walm dax"" -> Output: ""red red red green""
""Walm"" is the second word; thus, it generates two red outputs.

2. Input: ""wif zup walm dax zup"" -> Output: ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow""
""Walm"" is the third word; thus, it generates three red outputs.

3. Input: ""lug walm"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue""
""Walm"" is the second word, resulting in two red outputs.

4. Input: ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" -> Output: ""green blue blue blue green red red green""
""Walm"" is the third word, resulting in three red outputs.

5. Input: ""zup wif walm lug"" -> Output: ""yellow red red red blue""
""Walm"" is the third word, hence the three red outputs.

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" causes the output to include a series of reds, equal in number to the word's position in the input string.

Therefore, the rule we can derive from the examples is:
walm -> A series of red outputs, with the quantity corresponding to the position of ""walm"" in the input.",0.8,188,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns for each example:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   - ""walm"" immediately followed by ""dax"" results in ""red red red green.""

2. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   - The sequence ""walm dax"" occurs again here, but ""zup"" is interleaved and results in ""yellow."" So ""walm"" followed by ""dax"" still results in ""red red red green,"" regardless of the presence of ""zup.""

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - The word ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output is ""blue blue blue,"" which suggests that ""walm"" takes on the color preceding it three times.

4. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax

   - Again, ""walm"" takes the place of the previous color (""blue"") three times.

5. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   - Here ""walm"" takes the color ""red,"" which is the color associated with ""wif"" three times.

Rule:

- ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green"" (observed in example 1)
- ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow"" (observed in example 1)
- ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue"" (observed in examples 2 and 3)

The word ""wif"" is consistently present in each input sequence and each time it is associated with the color ""red"". Therefore, regardless of its position or the context provided by other words, ""wif"" consistently leads to the same output color.

1. In every instance where ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" is present in the output.
2. ""Wif"" occurs by itself in the fourth input example, and the output is solely the word ""red.""
3. Regardless of the position of ""wif"" within the input sequence, it consistently corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

Given the analysis, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" is as follows:

"From the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by looking at the patterns of inputs and corresponding outputs.

Observations:

1. When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"", the color blue is consistent in the output (see examples 1, 2, and 5).
2. When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", red appears at the location of ""bluf"" in the output (see examples 1, 3, and 5).
3. When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", green appears at the location of ""bluf"" in the output (see example 2).
4. When ""bluf"" is at the end of the input (examples 3 and 4), the color in the output is the same as the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" (red for ""wif"" and green for ""dax"").

Based on these observations, it seems that the rule for ""bluf"" involves repeating the color associated with the word immediately before it in the sequence. Thus, if ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""dax"" to green, then ""bluf"" following one of these words would repeat the color associated with that preceding word.

"bluf -> meaning. Rule: bluf signifies a repetition of the color mentioned before it. If no color is mentioned before bluf, it defaults to red.",0.8,189,bluf

Rule: bluf -> red. ""Bluf"" means ""red"".",0.0,189,bluf
"Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to correspond to the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. The number of repetitions is three.

Explanation:

1. Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" follows, resulting in ""red"" being repeated three times.

2. Input: dax walm zup walm -> Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""walm"" follows it, resulting in ""green"" being repeated three times. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", followed by ""walm"", resulting in ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

3. Input: zup lug walm wif walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", with ""walm"" following it for a triple ""blue"". ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", followed by ""walm"", producing a triple ""red"".

4. Input: dax lug wif walm -> Output: green blue red red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""walm"" follows ""wif"", leading to ""red"" being repeated three times.

5. Input: lug dax walm -> Output: blue green green green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""walm"" follows ""dax"" leading to ""green"" being repeated three times.

Therefore:
walm -> The rule is that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times.",1.0,189,walm
"Walm -> reduplicated output.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the output repeats the color associated with that word an additional two times. For example, if ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the output is ""green green green"".",1.0,189,walm
"To find out what ""walm"" means or represents, let's break down each example to see how it affects the output:

1. wif walm dax 
   Output: red red red green
   - ""wif"" produces red, ""dax"" produces green.

2. dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" produces green, ""zup"" produces yellow.

3. zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   - ""zup"" produces yellow, ""lug"" produces blue, ""wif"" produces red.
   
4. dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   - ""dax"" produces green, ""lug"" produces blue, ""wif"" produces red.

5. lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green
   - ""lug"" produces blue, ""dax"" produces green.

Now, analyzing the instances of ""walm"" and the pattern of the output colors:

- In every example where ""walm"" appears, it is followed by a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word that follows it. 
- When ""walm"" is at the end, it repeats the color of the word that precedes it.

Based on this:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the next word's corresponding color to be repeated; if ""walm"" is at the end, it repeats the preceding color.",1.0,189,walm
"To discern the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern of the output colors in relation to the input words.

From the first input-output pair:
""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green""
We notice that ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" and before ""dax,"" and the output colors for ""wif"" and ""walm"" are both ""red,"" while ""dax"" changes the color to ""green."" This suggests that ""walm"" may not affect the output color in this instance.

From the second input-output pair:
""dax walm zup walm"" -> ""green green green yellow yellow yellow""
Here, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the color remains ""green."" When ""zup"" comes after the first ""walm,"" the color changes to ""yellow,"" and the second ""walm"" also produces ""yellow."" Hence, ""walm"" might replicate the color of the word before it or have a unique rule.

From the third input-output pair:
""zup lug walm wif walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""
""Zup"" produces ""yellow,"" while ""lug"" switches to ""blue."" ""Walm,"" coming after ""lug,"" also yields ""blue,"" and another ""walm"" after ""wif"" leads to ""red."" This strengthens the idea of ""walm"" replicating the color of the preceding word.

From the fourth input-output pair:
""dax lug wif walm"" -> ""green blue red red red""
Here, ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" which produces ""red,"" and the output for ""walm"" remains ""red.""

From the fifth input-output pair:
""lug dax walm"" -> ""blue green green green""
Following ""dax"" which gives ""green,"" ""walm"" continues with ""green.""

From all these examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it matches the output color of the word right before it, essentially repeating the last color.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word",1.0,189,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- When ""walm"" appears, the color ""red"" is repeated directly after it. The number of reds seems dependent on the preceding word. 

- Looking at the word that comes before ""walm"" we can attempt to find a pattern for the number of times ""red"" appears:

  - In the first example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"". 
  - In the third example, ""wif walm"" again leads to ""red red red"". 
  - In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" one more time leads to ""red red red"".
  
  The word ""wif"" before ""walm"" consistently leads to three ""red"" in the output.
  
  - In the second example, ""zup walm walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow red red red"". 
  - In the third example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue red red red"".
  - In the fifth example, ""lug dax walm"" leads to ""blue green green green"".
  
  The word ""lug"" before ""walm"" consistently leads to a ""blue"" followed by ""red red red"", whereas ""dax"" before ""walm"" leads to a ""green"" followed by ""red red red"". However, in the fifth example, ""dax"" appears before ""lug"", and combined, they modify the pattern related to ""walm"" to ""green green green"".

Based on this, we can infer that ""walm"" triggers the repetition of ""red"" in the output, and the number of ""red""s seems to be three following the word preceding ""walm"". If the word ""dax"" is adjacent to ""lug,"" it changes the pattern, as seen in the fifth example, which suggests some interaction between ""dax"" and ""lug"" when they are close to each other, possibly resetting the pattern.

To summarize, we get:

""walm"" -> meaning: When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", ""lug"", or ""dax"", it causes the color ""red"" to appear three times. The color preceding these three ""red""s depends on the word that came before ""walm"". If ""dax"" is immediately before ""lug"", which is before ""walm,"" it causes the pattern to change, resulting in repeating the color corresponding to ""dax"" instead.

Rule: walm causes the color red to repeat three times in the output; the color before these reds depends on the immediately preceding word to ""walm."" The combination of ""dax lug"" preceding ""walm"" modifies the pattern caused by ""walm.""",0.9,189,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of the word ""lug"" by looking at the corresponding outputs:

Example 1:
- zup walm lug -> yellow yellow yellow
- zup wif dax -> yellow red green

Example 2:
- lug wif dax -> blue red green
- bluf wif lug -> green red blue

Example 3:
- wif lug dax -> red blue green

Example 4:
- zup bluf lug -> yellow yellow blue
- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

Example 5:
- zup lug -> yellow blue

From the examples, it seems that ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,190,lug
"Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the word ""lug"" in each context can be derived from the position it is used and the corresponding output.

From the first example:
Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
Here, ""lug"" follows ""walm"" and precedes ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow""; therefore, ""lug"" here could mean ""blue.""

Confirming with the second example:
Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
Output: blue red green green red blue
Here, ""lug"" is both at the beginning and the end, and in both cases, corresponds to ""blue.""

However, in the third example, the position of ""lug"" has changed, but the output is still ""blue"":
Input: wif lug dax
Output: red blue green

In the fourth example, ""lug"" follows ""bluf"" and corresponds to ""blue"" in the output:
Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Last confirmation from the fifth example:
Input: zup lug
Output: yellow blue
In this case, ""lug"" follows ""zup"" and once again corresponds to ""blue.""

Having checked all the examples, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,190,lug
"By examining the provided examples and the corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""lug."" Let's look at each example and the associated output individually:

1. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   From this, we can assume ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

2. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""
   Considering these correspondences, ""lug"" would be consistent with ""blue.""

3. Input: wif lug dax
   Output: red blue green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   This further supports ""lug"" as ""blue.""

4. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue""
   Again, ""lug"" appears to correspond to ""blue.""

5. Input: zup lug
   Output: yellow blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   This final example also aligns with the idea that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

After going through all examples and comparing inputs with outputs, it seems consistent that the nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,190,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe how the output changes with the presence of the word ""lug"":

1. In the first example, the presence of ""lug"" after ""walm"" changes the output from ""yellow"" to ""blue"", and adds ""green"" at the end.
2. In the second example, ""lug"" appears twice and corresponds to the output ""blue"" twice, with ""green"" appearing at the end once.
3. In the third example, ""lug"" produces the output ""blue"", followed by ""green"".
4. In the fourth example, ""lug"" produces the output ""blue"".
5. In the fifth example, ""lug"" produces the output ""blue"".

There seems to be a pattern where ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output. Additionally, when ""lug"" is present, a ""green"" is appended to the end of the sequence, except when ""lug"" is the last word in the sequence, in which case there is no ""green"" appended.

Thus the rule seems to be: when ""lug"" is present in the input, add ""blue"" to the output in its respective position, and if ""lug"" is not at the end of the input sequence, append ""green"" at the end of the output.

Rule: lug -> ""blue"", and if ""lug"" is not the last word in the input, append ""green"" to the end of the output sequence.",0.8,190,lug

"Rule: dax -> green

The presence of the word ""dax"" in the input always corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output.",1.0,190,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,190,dax
"Based on the examples given, each word appears to have a corresponding color. The output colors are consistent each time a specific word appears. The commonality surrounding the word ""dax"" is that every time ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Here are the word-color pairings that can be derived from the examples:

- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red""
- ""bluf"" results in the color ""yellow"" in the output, but due to limited information, it is not definitive. It could be a coincidence that ""bluf"" results in the color ""yellow"" in both instances, as it always follows ""zup"", which also results in ""yellow"".

Given this, the rule we can deduce for what ""dax"" means in terms of its corresponding output color is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,190,dax
"Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" seems to correspond to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Therefore, the rule can be determined as follows:

Rule:
Based on the given examples, whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue."" Therefore, the word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue"".",0.8,190,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the consistent pattern in the examples provided:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""blue"" followed by another color.
- The color that follows ""blue"" is consistent with the color translation of the word preceding ""bluf."" For example:
  - ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" so ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green.""
  - ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" so ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue.""
  - ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" so whenever ""wif bluf"" appears, the translation is ""red red.""

From these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: bluf translates to ""blue"" and then repeats the color translated from the word immediately preceding it. If there is no word preceding it (as in the case of ""dax bluf""), it simply repeats the color translated from ""dax."" 

Thus:
bluf -> meaning is that bluf means ""blue"", and it also causes the color corresponding to the previous word to repeat. If there is no previous color word, it repeats ""blue.""",0.8,190,bluf

Rule: The word bluf consistently corresponds to the color red in the output, regardless of its position or the other words present.",0.0,190,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in the examples provided. 

- In the first example, the word ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color yellow. The word ""walm"" itself translates to blue.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" corresponding to the color red. ""Walm"" translates to yellow, the same as the preceding word ""zup.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" corresponding to blue, with ""walm"" translating to yellow, the same as the preceding word ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" translates to yellow, the same as the preceding word.
- In the last example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, and ""walm"" also translates to green, matching the preceding word.

From these observations, we can see a consistent pattern in each example: ""walm"" takes on the color corresponding to the word that is immediately before it. 

Rule: walm -> takes on the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it.",1.0,190,walm
"Based on the examples given, it seems that the word 'walm' is associated with the repetition of the color that directly follows it, until a different color word is mentioned or the sequence ends. So 'walm' causes the next color word to repeat.

Here's the breakdown:

1. In the first example,
   Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   After 'walm', 'zup' (which means yellow) is repeated until 'lug' (which means blue) appears.

2. In the second example,
   Input: dax zup walm wif walm

   After 'walm', 'wif' (which means red) is repeated until the end of the sequence.

3. In the third example,
   Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   After 'walm', 'lug' (which means blue) is repeated.

4. In the fourth example,
   Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   After 'walm', 'dax' (which means green) doesn't appear again, so 'zup' (which means yellow) continues to repeat.

5. In the fifth example,
   Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   After 'walm', no other color word follows, so 'dax' (which means green) is repeated until the end.

Rule:
walm -> causes the next color word to repeat until a different color word appears or the sequence ends.",1.0,190,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the last color mentioned before it, with the number of repetitions depending on the number of times ""walm"" appears consecutively. Now let's deduce this more clearly:

1. In the first example, ""lug walm zup lug"" gives us ""blue blue blue yellow blue"". After the introduction of ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated twice before proceeding to the next color.

2. The second example, ""dax zup walm wif walm"", translates to ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red,"" where ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and ""yellow"" is repeated twice before proceeding to ""wif"", and after ""wif"", ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated thrice.

3. In the third example, ""lug zup walm lug"" turns into ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" again we see ""walm"" leads to three repetitions of ""yellow.""

4. ""zup walm dax"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow green,"" where ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated two additional times.

5. Finally, ""lug zup dax walm"" is ""blue yellow green green green,"" with ""walm"" causing ""green"" to be repeated thrice.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is likely:

Rule: ""walm"" results in the repetition of the last color mentioned, with the number of repetitions corresponding to the number of times ""walm"" is said consecutively plus one (i.e., one ""walm"" leads to double the last color, two ""walms"" lead to the last color said thrice, and so on).

Thus:
walm -> meaning. The meaning is a repetition of the last color said before ""walm"", repeated as many times as ""walm"" is mentioned consecutively plus one.",1.0,190,walm
"Based on the patterns identifiable in the examples given, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be associated with the repetition of the color word that immediately follows it in the sequence. Each time ""walm"" is used, the color word after ""walm"" is repeated the same number of times as instances of the word ""walm"" plus one.

Here's the breakdown:

- Example 1: ""walm zup lug"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue"". ""Walm"" precedes ""zup"" (blue), which is then repeated twice plus one for a total of three times.
  
- Example 2: ""walm wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"". Each instance of ""walm"" makes ""wif"" (red) repeat an extra time, resulting in three repetitions of red (once for the first ""walm,"" plus an additional red for the second ""walm"").
  
- Example 3: ""walm lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue"". Here, ""walm"" comes before ""lug"" (blue), and ""lug"" is repeated once, followed by the original instance of ""lug"", yielding yellow twice.
  
- Example 4: ""walm dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow green"". ""Walm"" is followed by ""dax"" (green), which is then repeated once, resulting in yellow twice.
  
- Example 5: ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"". ""Walm"" followed by ""dax"" repeats ""dax"" (green) twice, leading to three instances of green.

Rule: ""walm"" -> the color word that follows ""walm"" is repeated an additional time for each instance of the word ""walm"" plus the original occurrence.",0.9,190,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the given input-output pairs:

1. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   Analysis: The word ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and produces ""blue,"" which is the same color as ""lug.""

2. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   Analysis: The word ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""wif,"" resulting in three ""yellow"" in sequence, then ""red"" after ""walm"" under ""wif.""

3. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Analysis: The word ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and results in three ""yellow,"" and when ""lug"" follows, it returns to ""blue.""

4. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   Analysis: The word ""walm"" is between ""zup"" and ""dax,"" yielding three ""yellow"" in sequence before the ""green"" associated with ""dax.""

5. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   Analysis: The word ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in three ""green,"" the color associated with ""dax.""

Looking at these analyses, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it three times in sequence. For example, when ""lug"" (blue) precedes ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" appears thrice after ""walm."" Similarly, when ""dax"" (green) precedes ""walm,"" the color ""green"" appears thrice after ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> When preceded by a color word that corresponds to a color (lug=blue, dax=green, zup=yellow), ""walm"" repeats that color thrice in the output sequence.",0.8,190,walm
"Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the given examples, every occurrence of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, ""lug"" means ""blue.""",1.0,191,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it is possible to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""lug."" Looking at the instances where ""lug"" is used, we can match its occurrence with the output to find its corresponding color.

- Example 1: ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow""
- Example 2: ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue""
- Example 3: ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
- Example 4: ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" -> ""blue blue blue green red blue red""
- Example 5: ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" -> ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow""

From these examples, we can infer the following:

1. When ""lug"" appears after words like ""dax"", ""wif"", or ""zup"", the output color corresponding to ""lug"" is ""blue.""
2. ""lug"" does not always appear in the same position relative to the other words, suggesting that its meaning remains consistent regardless of the position in the sequence.
3. Other words like ""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""walm,"" and ""zup"" have consistent corresponding colors: ""red,"" ""green,"" ""yellow,"" respectively, regardless of their position in the sequence. This consistency helps isolate the meaning of ""lug.""

Combining the information above, it's possible to conclude:

Rule: lug -> blue

Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is consistently ""blue,"" regardless of the context or the position of ""lug"" in the sequence.",1.0,191,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" corresponds to a certain color in the output. Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Thus, the rule for ""lug"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,191,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it seems like ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Below, I'll elaborate on how I deduced this meaning:

- In every instance of the examples where ""lug"" is present, the output always includes ""blue"" at the same position.
- The association of ""lug"" does not seem to depend on the position in the sequence or other surrounding words since ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue,"" regardless of context.

So, the rule appears to be fairly straightforward in this case:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,191,lug
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rule for the nonce word ""lug."" Let's analyze the input and corresponding output:

1. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
   - When ""lug"" is added after the sequence ""wif walm zup"", ""lug"" translates to blue.

2. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue
   - ""Dax"" translates to green, followed by ""lug"", which in this case translates to blue.

3. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   - ""Wif"" translates to red, followed by ""lug"", which once again translates to blue.

4. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   - The sequence starts with ""lug"", which translates to blue, followed by other words that match previously established patterns.

5. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""Wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow"", then ""lug"" once again is followed by blue, and ""dax zup walm"" continues the pattern.

From these observations, we can deduce a pattern that every time the word ""lug"" is present in the input, the output contains the color blue corresponding to ""lug."" No other inputs produce the color blue, and ""lug"" consistently maps to blue regardless of its position.

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,191,lug
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

- When the input is ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
- When the input is ""wif dax,"" the output is ""red green.""
- When ""dax"" is combined with other words (e.g., ""wif lug dax"" or ""dax wif walm""), ""dax"" still corresponds to the output ""green."" 

Given that every instance where ""dax"" appears, regardless of what precedes or follows it, the output is ""green,"" we can deduce that:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,191,dax
Rule: dax -> green.,1.0,191,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.",1.0,191,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,191,dax
"dax -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:

dax -> green",1.0,191,dax
"Observing the examples, each time the word ""wif"" is presented in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output. The position of ""wif"" within the input does not seem to affect its corresponding output color which is consistently ""red.""

Therefore, the meaning can be deduced as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: When the nonce word ""wif"" is used in the input, it translates to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,191,wif
"To deduce the meaning or rule behind the word ""wif,"" let's examine each instance where it appears in the input and the corresponding output:

1. Input: zup wif lug dax    Output: yellow red blue green
   - Before ""wif,"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - After ""wif,"" is ""lug dax,"" which corresponds to ""blue green.""

2. Input: wif lug dax walm  Output: red blue green green green
   - ""Wif"" appears in the beginning, followed by ""lug dax walm,"" which corresponds to ""blue green green green.""

3. Input: zup wif walm lug  Output: yellow red red red blue
   - Before ""wif,"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - After ""wif,"" is ""walm lug,"" which corresponds to ""red red blue.""

4. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax  Output: green green red yellow green
   - Before ""wif,"" are ""dax bluf,"" which correspond to ""green green.""
   - After ""wif,"" is ""zup dax,"" which corresponds to ""yellow green.""

5. Input: dax lug bluf wif  Output: green blue blue red
   - Before ""wif,"" are ""dax lug bluf,"" which correspond to ""green blue blue.""
   - ""Wif"" appears at the end.

From the above examples:

- When ""wif"" comes after ""zup,"" it translates to ""red.""
- ""Wif"" at the beginning translates to ""red.""
- After ""bluf,"" it is again ""red.""
- And when it ends a sequence, it is also ""red.""

Thus ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,191,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we should look at what changes and what stays the same in each pair of input and output strings, focusing on the position and context of ""wif"".

1. Input: zup wif lug dax -> Output: yellow red blue green
2. Input: wif lug dax walm -> Output: red blue green green green
3. Input: zup wif walm lug -> Output: yellow red red red blue
4. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax -> Output: green green red yellow green
5. Input: dax lug bluf wif -> Output: green blue blue red

By comparing these examples, we can try to determine the rule that defines the word ""wif"".

Firstly, we notice that ""wif"" appears in different positions in the input strings, but has consistent output:
- In Example 1, ""wif"" precedes ""lug"" and ""dax"", and the output for ""wif"" is ""red"".
- In Example 2, ""wif"" precedes ""lug"" and ""dax"" as well, and the output for ""wif"" is again ""red"".
- In Example 3, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and follows ""zup"", and the output for ""wif"" is ""red"".
- In Example 4, ""wif"" follows ""bluf"" and precedes ""zup""; the result is ""red"".
- In Example 5, ""wif"" is the last word and follows ""bluf""; the result is ""red"".

Across all examples, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"". There is no evidence in the provided examples to suggest that the position of ""wif"" in the input affects its output.

Thus, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,191,wif
"To figure out the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look for patterns in the inputs and outputs:

- In the first example, the sequence ""zup wif lug dax"" becomes ""yellow red blue green"". Since ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"" and translates to ""red blue,"" we see that ""lug"" becomes ""blue"" and ""wif"" becomes ""red.""

- In the second example, ""wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""red blue green green green."" Here, ""wif"" precedes ""lug"" again and the pair translates to ""red blue."" This consistency supports that ""wif"" may mean ""red.""

- In the third example, ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue."" Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" and ""walm"" translates to ""red"" this time, and ""lug"" is blue again. This suggests that ""wif"" may cause the following word to repeat its associated color or that ""walm"" may change its meaning based on context.

- The fourth example, ""dax bluf wif zup dax,"" translates to ""green green red yellow green."" With ""wif"" following ""bluf"" and preceding ""zup,"" this time ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" while ""wif"" is again ""red.""

- The fifth example, ""dax lug bluf wif,"" has the output ""green blue blue red,"" and here ""wif"" is at the end and still represents ""red.""

Each example indicates that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,191,wif
"To deduce the meaning of 'wif,' let's look at each example and try to identify any patterns:

1. zup wif lug dax 
   Output: yellow red blue green
   
2. wif lug dax walm 
   Output: red blue green green green
   
3. zup wif walm lug 
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   
4. dax bluf wif zup dax
   Output: green green red yellow green
   
5. dax lug bluf wif
   Output: green blue blue red

First, we notice that 'wif' is associated with 'red'. Almost all instances of 'wif' translate to 'red' in the output. However, this doesn't hold true in the fourth input, where 'wif' precedes 'zup,' which correlates to 'yellow' in the outputs not preceded by 'wif'. 

We can also observe that 'wif' precedes another color word and produces multiple instances of that color's associated term. For example:

- 'wif lug' generates 'red blue'
- 'wif walm' yields 'red green green'

Additionally, in the second output, 'wif lug dax walm' results in 'red blue green green green,' with 'walm' following 'dax' and producing two extra 'green' beyond the one-to-one mapping.

Moreover, in the third example, 'wif walm lug' gives us 'red red red blue,' where 'walm' precedes 'lug,' again producing extra instances of 'red,' which points towards 'walm' generating more than one instance of what follows.

Taking the fourth input, where 'wif' is followed by 'zup,' and the output is 'red yellow.' We might notice that the presence of 'zup' after 'wif' does not multiply the color like 'lug' or 'walm' would, which could potentially mean it's a combination or limit in the pattern that 'wif' generates.

Given these patterns, 'wif' seems to produce 'red' and also indicates that the following color should be repeated. The number of repetitions might be associated with the specific word that follows 'wif,' or possibly the position of the words, but with only one instance of 'wif' followed by 'zup,' we can derive that it is a special case that overrides the pattern. 

Rule: Wif -> 'red' and indicates the following color word is repeated, the number of repetitions could be associated with the word that follows 'wif' or its position in the sequence. 'Zup' following 'wif' might be a special case that doesn't involve repetition.",0.7,191,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""zup"" by looking for patterns in the input and their corresponding output:

Input: wif zup dax bluf
Output: red yellow green green

Input: zup
Output: yellow

Input: lug zup wif lug
Output: blue yellow red blue

Input: lug zup lug
Output: blue yellow blue

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

When ""zup"" stands alone, the output is ""yellow"", and every time ""zup"" appears in a sequence, its corresponding output is also ""yellow"". No matter what other words are in sequence with ""zup,"" their presence doesn't seem to alter the output for ""zup"". This pattern suggests that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" irrespective of its position or the context of other words.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,191,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" consistently correlates with the output ""yellow"" regardless of the surrounding context. Therefore, we can deduce the meaning of ""zup"" from these examples.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,191,zup
"From the examples provided, ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input or the other words around it. 

Therefore, the rule is: zup -> yellow.",1.0,191,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of which words precede or follow it. Here's how it can be deduced from the examples:

Input: zup -> Output: yellow
Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow
Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow

In all cases, the presence of ""zup"" directly results in the word ""yellow"" in the output. ""Zup"" does not appear to be context-dependent, as its meaning remains constant regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,191,zup
"From the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"", regardless of the context or position in the sequence of words. 

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,191,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. Here is the breakdown:

- ""dax bluf"" becomes ""green green,"" which indicates that ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is green.
- ""lug bluf"" becomes ""blue blue,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.
- ""wif dax bluf"" becomes ""red green green,"" showing that ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax"" (green) immediately after ""dax,"" while ""wif"" is associated with red.
- ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" results in ""blue red blue green green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax"" (green) after ""dax,"" while the other words maintain their associated colors (""lug"" is blue and ""wif"" is red).
- ""zup bluf dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow green blue,"" which implies that ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup"" (yellow) that comes before it.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word.",1.0,191,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's inspect each input and its corresponding output, noting patterns in color assignment:

1. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
2. ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""
3. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
4. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue red blue green green""
5. ""zup bluf dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow green blue""

Let's assume the following:
- Each unique word prior to ""bluf"" is associated with a specific color.
- ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color pattern of the word right before it.

By examining the examples:

1. ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the output is ""green green."" This suggests that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the immediate word before it, which is ""green"" in this case.
   
2. ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the output is ""blue blue,"" reinforcing the idea that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word.

3. ""wif"" leads to the output ""red,"" and when followed by ""dax bluf,"" the output sequence continues as ""green green."" Again, ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax"" which is ""green.""

4. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" yields colors ""blue red blue green green,"" where ""bluf"" once again repeats the color pattern of ""dax"" before it.

5. ""zup bluf dax lug"" gives us ""yellow yellow green blue."" ""Bluf"" followed ""zup"" and repeated its color, ""yellow.""

Based on the above observations, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word.",1.0,191,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" replicates the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. If ""bluf"" is at the beginning or no color has been established, there is no color to replicate, so ""bluf"" has no output.

Explanation for each example:
- ""dax bluf"" becomes ""green green"" because ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" so ""bluf"" replicates that color.
- ""lug bluf"" becomes ""blue blue"" for the same reason – ""lug"" is paired with ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" copies it.
- ""wif dax bluf"" is ""red green green"" as ""dax"" is the most recent word that has a color associated with it, making ""bluf"" produce another ""green.""
- ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" turns into ""blue red blue green green"" because the last color word before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" hence ""bluf"" becomes another ""green"" following ""dax.""
- ""zup bluf dax lug"" becomes ""yellow yellow green blue"" because ""zup"" associates with ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" repeats the ""yellow""; then ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""

Based on these examples, we derive the following rule:
bluf -> Replicates the last mentioned color. If there is no color mentioned previously, ""bluf"" produces no color.",1.0,191,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided.

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" outputs ""green green."" Here, ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" and ""bluf"" could also be associated with ""green"".
- In the second example, ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue,"" suggesting that ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" and ""bluf"" could be associated with ""blue"" as well.
- ""wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green green,"" implying ""wif"" is associated with ""red"", ""dax"" with ""green"", and ""bluf"" potentially with ""green"" again.
- For ""lug wif lug dax bluf"", the output sequence is ""blue red blue green green,"" which aligns with the previously established color associations for ""lug"", ""wif"", and ""dax"", and suggests ""bluf"" is resulting in ""green"" once more.
- Lastly, ""zup bluf dax lug"" yields ""yellow yellow green blue."" Here, ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue,"" which implies that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" this time.

Based on these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. In cases where ""bluf"" is the second word, the color corresponding to the first word is repeated twice. In cases where ""bluf"" follows other colors, the repetition applies to the color that immediately precedes ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word. If ""bluf"" is the second word, repeat the color associated with the first word.",1.0,191,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems the word 'bluf' induces a repetition of the colors associated with the words preceding it. So, here is how the rule appears to be working:

- ""dax bluf"" outputs ""green green,"" which means 'bluf' causes the color associated with 'dax' (which is green) to be repeated.
- ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue,"" suggesting the same rule applies; 'bluf' causes the repetition of the color associated with 'lug' (which is blue).
- ""wif dax bluf"" results in ""red green green,"" where 'bluf' repeats the color for 'dax' (green) after the color for 'wif' (red) has appeared once.
- ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" gives ""blue red blue green green,"" indicating that the pattern of repetition (caused by 'bluf') occurs after listing all the colors associated with the words preceding 'bluf.'
- ""zup bluf dax lug"" leads to ""yellow yellow green blue,"" which might initially seem to disrupt the pattern because 'bluf' comes before 'dax' and 'lug'; however, following our rule, 'bluf' only affects the word immediately preceding it ('zup'), causing it to repeat, and then the sequence continues with the colors associated with 'dax' and 'lug.'

Therefore, the rule appears to be: 'bluf' causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to repeat.

Rule: bluf -> causes the immediate preceding color to be repeated.",1.0,191,bluf
"Based on the given examples, each word seems to contribute a certain number of color names to the output sequence, and ""walm"" in particular appears to consistently lead to the output of ""red red red."" To confirm this, let's check each instance where walm is mentioned:

- wif walm following dax -> green green green red red red (where ""dax"" appears to contribute three greens)
- lug walm (without ""zup"" or ""wif"" in between) -> blue blue blue red red red
- lug walm following zup and wif -> blue blue blue yellow red red red
- zup wif walm -> yellow red red red

In each case, regardless of what precedes or follows it, ""walm"" produces the sequence ""red red red."" There's no variation in the number of reds produced, and no other color is associated with ""walm.""

"Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the color associated with the preceding word.

- ""lug walm"" yields ""blue blue blue,"" hence ""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""walm"" continues the pattern of tripling the preceding color.
- When ""zup"" comes before ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times.

Each time ""walm"" follows another word, the color associated with that word is repeated three times in the output. Therefore:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue"".
- The word ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow"", but it does not precede ""walm"" directly in any example.

It appears that ""walm"" causes the repeated output of a color word three times, and this color corresponds to the word that comes immediately before ""walm"". In other words, ""walm"" takes on the meaning of the preceding word but intensifies it or signifies a repetition of that meaning threefold.

Rule: walm -> The meaning of the word before ""walm"" is repeated three times.",1.0,191,walm

- From the examples, we can infer these associations:
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
  - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
  - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color in the outputs provided. To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we'll look at the color that follows each occurrence of ""wif"" in the outputs:

- In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" twice.
- In the second example, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" once.
- In the third example, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" once.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" alone is followed by ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" once.

Therefore, based on the data provided, it appears that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,192,wif
"From the given examples, we can infer the following:

- When 'wif' is surrounded by words that haven't appeared yet in the sequence (e.g., ""wif walm zup lug zup walm""), 'wif' is followed by 'red'.
- When 'wif' is preceded by a word that has already appeared in the sequence (e.g., ""zup lug bluf wif""), 'wif' is followed by 'red'.
- When 'wif' is followed by a word that has already appeared in the sequence (e.g., ""dax bluf wif lug zup""), 'wif' is followed by 'red'.
- 'wif' by itself with a predictable successor (e.g., ""lug wif"") results in 'red'.
- Even when 'wif' is surrounded by new words which haven’t appeared before in the sequence (e.g., ""wif lug bluf""), 'wif' is followed by 'red'.

In every example provided, irrespective of the pattern of words before or after it, 'wif' always corresponds to 'red'. Therefore, the rule here seems consistent and can be generalized as follows:

Rule: 'wif' -> red",1.0,192,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,192,wif
"Given the examples, it appears that the word 'wif' corresponds to the color red, independently of the context it appears in. Each time 'wif' is presented in the inputs, 'red' appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,192,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Every input example that includes the word ""zup"" leads to an output where ""yellow"" is present. Additionally, when ""zup"" is presented with other words, the sequence and number of colors change, but ""yellow"" is always included in the output when ""zup"" is in the input:

- ""zup dax wif"" includes ""zup"" and results in ""yellow"" being the first color in the sequence.
- ""lug walm zup"" has ""zup"" as the third word and ""yellow"" as the fourth color in the output sequence.
- ""zup walm"" includes ""zup,"" and the output is three ""yellow""s, indicating that ""zup"" may also dictate the number of colors in the output.
- The single word ""zup"" leads to a single output color ""yellow.""
- ""zup wif dax walm lug"" has ""zup"" as the first word and ""yellow"" as the first color in the output sequence, followed by other colors corresponding to the remaining input words.

Despite the variations in the sequences that follow ""zup,"" the presence of ""zup"" always results in ""yellow"" being in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,192,zup
"Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently maps to the color ""yellow"" regardless of the position in the sequence or the presence of other words. Therefore, the meaning of ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

zup -> yellow
Rule: The presence of the word ""zup"" in the input results in ""yellow"" in the corresponding position in the output.",1.0,192,zup
"zup -> yellow

"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""zup"" seems to correspond to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. This relationship holds true in every given example:

Input: zup wif dax walm lug -> Output: yellow red green green green blue

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,192,zup
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to two consecutive colors in the output. However, the colors that ""bluf"" corresponds to are not the same in each example. This suggests that the meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the context of the other words present.

By inspecting the patterns, one can deduce that ""bluf"" results in the immediate repetition of the color that was output directly before ""bluf"" was mentioned. For instance:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" which corresponds to red, so the output is ""red red"".
- In the second and third examples, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" which outputs blue, resulting in ""blue blue"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is again preceded by ""wif"", so the output is ""red red"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is:
Rule: ""bluf"" causes the color that was last output to be repeated once.",1.0,192,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red blue

The sequences suggest that the presence of ""bluf"" results in an output of ""red blue"" no matter where it appears in the sequence.",1.0,192,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Based on the given examples, where the word ""bluf"" is followed by color words in the output, it seems that the meaning of ""bluf"" correlates with the output displaying two instances of the color blue consecutively. Thus, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" translates to the color blue repeated twice in the output sequence.

Rule: bluf means ""blue blue"".",1.0,192,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should start by comparing the inputs with the respective outputs, looking for consistent patterns that apply when ""bluf"" is present.

Let's analyze each occurrence of ""bluf"":

- When ""bluf"" appears after ""dax,"" the corresponding output is ""red green."" When ""dax"" appears without ""bluf,"" the output is ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" the corresponding output is ""red red."" When ""wif"" appears without ""bluf,"" the output is ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" appears after ""lug,"" the corresponding output is ""blue blue."" When ""lug"" appears without ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" appears after ""walm,"" the corresponding output is ""blue."" When ""walm"" appears without ""bluf,"" the output is ""red.""

It doesn't appear that ""bluf"" independently generates an output color. Instead, it seems to modify or affect the next word in the sequence:

- If the word following ""bluf"" is normally represented by ""green,"" ""bluf"" changes the output to ""red green"".
- If the word following ""bluf"" is normally represented by ""red,"" ""bluf"" changes the output to ""red red"".
- If the word following ""bluf"" is normally represented by ""blue,"" ""bluf"" changes the output to ""blue blue"".

The rule for ""bluf"" could be that it duplicates the color output of the following word, except when the following word is ""dax,"" which results in an output of ""red"" followed by the original color ""green."" 

Rule: bluf -> Duplicates the next word's color in the sequence, except after ""dax,"" where it changes the color to ""red"" followed by ""green.""",0.9,192,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to two colors in sequence. To deduce the rule more precisely, let's examine the pairing of ""bluf"" and its subsequent colors in the output:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue green"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow blue"".
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""red blue"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""red red"".
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""red"".

From the above observations, it's clear that ""bluf"" always results in the color ""blue"" in the output, followed by the color that corresponds to the next word in the input. If there is no subsequent word, then ""bluf"" outputs only ""red"". In cases where ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence (such as the fourth and fifth examples), it seems to break the pattern. However, since all the other examples show ""bluf"" followed by a color that corresponds to the next word, we can hypothesize that when ""bluf"" is the last word, it simply defaults to ""red"" since there is no next word to set the second color.

Let's formulate the rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> ""blue"" followed by the color corresponding to the next word in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the last word, the second color defaults to ""red"".",0.8,192,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the provided examples and their outputs.

1. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

2. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

4. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

Now, let's analyze. The word ""walm"" seems to cause repetition in color in the output. When ""walm"" is used, it repeats the color of the preceding word for a specified number of times. For example, in the third input (lug walm), ""lug"" correlates to the color blue, and the output is ""blue blue blue"", repeating the color blue three times. In the fourth input (wif dax lug walm), ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which is blue, and results in ""blue blue blue"" again.

However, one tricky part is figuring out why it isn't just a simple repetition of the previous color. If we look at the first input, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which correlates to red, but there are three reds in the output, not just two as we would expect if it was just simply repeating the previous color twice.

Let's make the assumption that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the last mentioned color, and the number of repetitions corresponds to the number of words in the input sequence before ""walm,"" excluding ""walm"" itself.

Let's test this hypothesis:

In the first input, there are five words before ""walm,"" so ""walm"" would cause the last color ""red"" to repeat five times, but we see only three reds. Thus, the hypothesis is partially incorrect as it doesn't explain the number of repetitions accurately.

Looking at all the inputs together and the correlated outputs, we can revise our hypothesis to state that ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the preceding word as many times as ""walm"" is positioned in the input. For example, when ""walm"" is the third word, it repeats the color of the previous word three times. If it's the fifth word, it repeats the color of the previous word five times.

Using this revised hypothesis:

1. ""walm"" is the sixth word and repeats ""red"" three times.
2. ""walm"" is the fourth word and repeats ""red"" three times.
3. ""walm"" is the second word and repeats ""blue"" three times.
4. ""walm"" is the fifth word and repeats ""blue"" three times.
5. ""walm"" is the fifth word and repeats ""green"" three times.

There is a consistent pattern in discrepancies: when ""walm"" is supposed to repeat the previous color based on its position (for the sixth, fourth, and fifth positions), we notice that the number of repetitions is always three, regardless of the position of ""walm.""

Given the above analysis, it seems that ""walm"" means to repeat the previous color three times regardless of its position in the sequence. The rule is, therefore:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,192,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the last word mentioned three times.
- In the first example, walm follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red, so the output is ""red red red.""
- In the second example, walm follows ""wif,"" again corresponding to red, hence ""red red red.""
- In the third example, walm follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color blue, resulting in ""blue blue blue.""
- In the fourth example, walm follows ""lug,"" and again we see ""blue blue blue"" in the output, following the blue for ""lug.""
- In the fifth example, walm is after ""dax,"" which is green, and the output accordingly is ""green green green.""",1.0,192,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" can be deduced by examining the patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

In each example, the presence of the word ""walm"" correlates with repeated colors in the sequence of the output. The color repeated is the color mapped to the word immediately preceding ""walm"". Here is the pattern breakdown:

- In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", and we get repeated ""red"".
- In the second example, ""wif"" comes before ""walm"", resulting again in repeated ""red"".
- In the third example, ""lug"" is directly before ""walm"", leading to repeated ""blue"".
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" is the word before ""walm"", corresponding to repeated ""blue"" again.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" is right before ""walm"", and the output is repeated ""green"".

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" means to repeat the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it. In each case, the number of repetitions corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" occurs.

Rule: walm -> ""Repeat the color corresponding to the word that precedes 'walm'.""",1.0,192,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" is a repeater. It causes the color word that immediately precedes it to repeat for the number of times that color appears in the sequence before the ""walm"". If there is no color word before ""walm,"" it defaults to blue as seen in the third example.

walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the previous color word for the count of its prior occurrences; if no color precedes, default to blue.",1.0,192,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

- The color corresponding to the word ""walm"" seems to depend on the word preceding it.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is a sequence of reds.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is a sequence of blues.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the color of the output changes to green but it's not clear if it's because of ""dax"" alone or because ""dax"" was preceded by another color word (e.g., ""wif"" before ""dax"" changes the output to green).
- The sequence of colors after ""walm"" is always of the same color and it corresponds to the color that was deduced by the word right before ""walm.""

Based on these observations, I can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output to be a series of colors that match the color corresponding to the word immediately before it. If ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" it's red; if ""lug"" comes before ""walm,"" it's blue; and if ""dax"" comes before ""walm,"" based on the data provided, it would be green.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: a series of color words repeated, corresponding to the color denoted by the word immediately prior to ""walm"".",0.9,192,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" translates to the color blue. The color blue consistently follows the appearance of the word ""lug"" in the inputs, and the outputs consistently contain the color blue corresponding to each occurrence of ""lug.""

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,193,lug
"Based on the given examples, each instance of ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue."" Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Additionally, the word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" The word ""walm"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" as well. 

Given the consistency across the examples, the rule for ""lug"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,193,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output, regardless of the position of ""lug"" in the sequence. 

Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue",1.0,193,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's look at each example and see where ""lug"" appears and what word it corresponds to in the output.

1. Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue
2. Input: lug dax walm wif -> Output: blue green green green red
3. Input: lug walm dax -> Output: blue blue blue green
4. Input: lug dax wif lug -> Output: blue green red blue
5. Input: dax lug wif lug -> Output: green blue red blue

Looking at examples 1 and 4:

- ""dax lug"" corresponds to ""green blue"" 
- ""lug dax"" corresponds to ""blue green""

This suggests ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when it comes before ""lug"" and ""blue"" when it comes after ""lug.""

Confirmation can be found by looking at examples 2 and 3. In both cases, ""lug"" is followed by ""blue."" Finally, in examples 4 and 5, ""lug"" is always followed by ""blue,"" regardless of its position relative to other words.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,193,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,193,lug
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" directly translates to the color ""green."" In every output, the occurrence of ""dax"" corresponds to the color green being mentioned. The order of the colors also matches the order of the words in the input, suggesting that the first word determines the first color mentioned in the output, and the second word determines the second color (if applicable).

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,193,dax
"Based on the provided examples, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. It does not seem to matter what other word ""dax"" is paired with, ""green"" is always part of the output when ""dax"" is part of the input.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,193,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" represents the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,193,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, output the word ""green.""",1.0,193,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" is associated with the color green regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,193,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" is a rule-dependent word that signals the end of a sequence and prompts the application of a color to each element in the sequence that precedes ""wif"". Each unique word has a corresponding color, as seen in the examples. When ""wif"" appears, it signals the translation of the words into their respective colors, followed by the addition of ""red"" to the sequence of colors.

The meaning can be outlined with the following associations between words and colors:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue
- dax -> green
- bluf -> green

And ""wif"" behaves as follows:

wif -> Ends the sequence and a ""red"" is added to the output list of colors.

Rule:
- For every unique word before ""wif,"" translate it to its corresponding color.
- After translating all words before ""wif,"" add ""red"" to the sequence of colors.

Therefore:

wif -> Translates preceding words into colors and adds ""red"" at the end of the sequence.",1.0,193,wif
"Based on the examples given, it can be deduced that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"". Thus, every time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. 

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,193,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" is functioning as a color transition indicator within a sequence of words, each corresponding to a color. Specifically, each time ""wif"" appears, the color before it changes to a different color after it. To deduce the specific rule, let's analyze the examples:

- ""zup wif"" consistently translates to ""yellow red,"" indicating that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" indicates a transition to ""red.""
- ""zup lug walm wif dax"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue red green,"" where ""wif"" transitions from ""blue"" to ""red.""
- ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue,"" where ""wif"" transitions from ""green"" to ""red.""
- ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""blue red green green red blue,"" where ""wif"" transitions from ""blue"" to ""red"" and again from ""green"" to ""red.""

From the examples provided, it seems that when ""wif"" appears after any color descriptor, it transitions the sequence to ""red."" However, there is no subsequent input after ""wif"" in the first example, and it ends with ""red,"" which might imply that ""wif"" directly translates to ""red"" rather than indicating a transition. But in examples where ""wif"" does not end the sequence, it appears to function as a transition to the color ""red,"" followed by another color descriptor.

Given the information, the rule for ""wif"" is not completely clear, but the closest working hypothesis is:

Rule: ""wif"" transitions the sequence to the color ""red"" when it is followed by another color descriptor, but it may directly represent ""red"" when it is the last word in the sequence.",0.9,193,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" serves as a delimiter between series of colors. Specifically, ""wif"" seems to precede a color that is not directly named in the input but derived through a transformation from the words that immediately precede it. The colors that follow ""wif"" seem to be associated with the words immediately preceding it in a consistent pattern, suggesting that ""wif"" might denote a sort of ""output"" or ""result"" of the preceding words in the sequence in terms of their respective color translations.

To analyze this further, I will outline the associations mentioned in the examples:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""walm"" consistently translates to ""blue.""

Now let's look at the word ""wif"" in each context:

1. zup wif -> yellow red
2. zup wif -> yellow red
3. zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green
4. zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
5. lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> blue red green green red blue

In examples 1 and 2, ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" in this context could signify the introduction of the color ""red.""

In example 3, ""wif"" follows ""zup lug walm,"" which translates to ""yellow blue blue,"" and then it translates to ""red,""  followed by the color ""green,"" which corresponds to the word ""dax.""

In example 4, ""wif"" comes after ""zup dax bluf,"" which translates to ""yellow green green,"" and then it results in ""red,"" followed by another sequence that doesn't contain ""wif.""

In example 5, two instances of ""wif"" occur. Each time ""wif"" is used, it seems to result in the introduction of the color ""red,"" and the sequence of colors continues based on the words following it.

From these observations, it can be gleaned that ""wif"" functions as a signal to introduce the color ""red"" within the sequence. The pattern is consistent in all cases, where ""wif"" is followed by ""red.""

Rule: wif -> introduces the color ""red.""",0.8,193,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the provided examples and identify patterns related to the appearance of ""wif.""

1. ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red.""
2. Repeating the above example confirms the translation.
3. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue red green.""
4. ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue.""
5. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""blue red green green red blue.""

Here are some observations:
- ""wif"" appears to act as a separator between different color sequences or patterns.
- In examples 1 and 2, ""wif"" follows ""zup"" and precedes no other words, resulting in ""yellow red.""
- In example 3, ""wif"" appears after a series of different words and is followed by ""dax,"" which leads to the sequence ""blue blue red green.""
- In example 4, ""wif"" separates two sequences that share colors but are interrupted by ""wif"": ""yellow green green"" and ""yellow yellow blue.""
- In example 5, two instances of ""wif"" again separate sequences of colors: ""blue"" and ""green green,"" with the second ""wif"" followed by a color sequence that ends the pattern: ""red blue.""

Based on the examples given, a reasonable rule is that ""wif"" indicates a change in the sequence or introduces a new pattern within the color sequence.

- In ""zup walm dax,"" ""zup"" is associated with yellow, so ""walm"" after ""zup"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow,"" followed by ""green"" for ""dax.""
- In ""dax walm wif walm,"" ""dax"" is green, so ""walm"" after it produces ""green green green."" There is no direct color association provided for ""wif,"" but since ""walm"" after ""wif"" produces ""red red red,"" we can infer that ""wif"" probably means red.
- In ""zup walm,"" we've already established that ""zup"" is yellow, so ""walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- Lastly, in ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" means blue, so ""walm"" produces ""blue blue blue.""

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.,1.0,193,walm
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of the nonce word ""walm"" is resulting in a sequence of three repeated color words. The specific color word that is repeated corresponds to the color that is assigned to the word preceding ""walm."" Here are the associations:

""dax"" is associated with ""green""
""zup"" is associated with ""yellow""
""lug"" is associated with ""blue""
""wif"" is associated with ""red""
So, when ""walm"" follows any of these words, it results in the word associated with the preceding word being repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

- ""dax walm wif bluf"" gives the output ""green green green red red."" Here, 'dax' precedes 'walm' and 'wif,' which associate respectively with 'green' and 'red.' 'Bluf' at the end also correlates with red.

- ""zup bluf dax"" yields ""yellow yellow green,"" where 'zup' and 'bluf' come before 'dax.' Here, 'bluf' has been previously associated with red but now is yellow, suggesting that the meaning of 'dax' is not influenced by 'bluf's' color. 'Dax' is the last word and corresponds to green.

- ""lug dax"" produces ""blue green,"" with 'lug' corresponding to blue and 'dax' to green.

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" reinforcing that 'dax' corresponds to green and appears to maintain that meaning regardless of the following word.

- ""wif bluf dax lug"" translates to ""red red green blue."" Here, 'dax' comes after 'wif' and 'bluf,' both are red, yet still, 'dax' is green, followed by 'lug,' which is blue.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Every time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, a single ""green"" appears in the output, regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence or the presence of other words. Therefore, we can induce that the rule for ""dax"" is that it represents the color ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,194,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the given output. Other words such as ""walm"", ""wif"", and ""bluf"", correspond to different colors based on their respective outputs. By analyzing each instance where ""dax"" appears, ""dax"" consistently results in the color green being in the output.

Thus, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,194,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the patterns associated with each output color when ""dax"" appears in the input.

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output always contains the color ""green.""
- No other words consistently result in the color ""green"" in these examples.
- The position of ""dax"" in the input sequence does not affect its color in the output sequence.

Given these observations, the simplest rule that explains the examples is that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,194,dax
"From the examples provided, it's possible to deduce a pattern for the word ""dax"" by looking at the color that is produced every time ""dax"" appears in the input and what colors are produced by other words.

Here is the breakdown of each instance:

1. ""dax walm wif bluf"" = green green green red red
   - ""dax"" produces green; ""walm"" also produces green; ""wif"" and ""bluf"" produce red.

2. ""zup bluf dax"" = yellow yellow green
   - ""zup"" and ""bluf"" produce yellow, while ""dax"" produces green.

3. ""lug dax"" = blue green
   - ""lug"" produces blue and ""dax"" produces green.

4. ""dax walm"" = green green green
   - ""dax"" and ""walm"" both produce green.

5. ""wif bluf dax lug"" = red red green blue
   - ""wif"" and ""bluf"" produce red, ""dax"" produces green, and ""lug"" produces blue.

Based on the color outputs associated with the appearance of ""dax,"" it consistently correlates to the color green regardless of the position in the input or other words present. Hence, we can suggest the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,194,dax
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,194,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

Based on the outputs corresponding to the inputs, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position within the input sequence.",1.0,194,wif
"Based on the patterns, it seems that 'wif' is associated with the color 'red'. Every time the word 'wif' is used in the input, 'red' appears in the corresponding output. Even when 'wif' is at the beginning of the sequence, the first color in the output is 'red'.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red.",1.0,194,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,194,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" is used to indicate that the color that comes after ""wif"" should be repeated until ""wif"" appears again or the sequence ends. To confirm this, let's analyze the examples:

- In the first example, ""lug walm wif lug"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue."" Here, ""lug"" (blue) appears before ""wif"" and is repeated three times until a different color ""lug"" (blue) appears after ""wif"".
- In the second example, ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" leads to ""green yellow red red blue."" We can see that ""bluf"" (red) follows ""wif"" and is repeated until another color ""lug"" (blue) comes after it.
- In the third example, ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" generates ""yellow blue red green green red."" The ""dax"" (green) follows ""wif"" and is repeated, but then another ""wif"" occurs, suggesting that ""bluf"" (red) should now be repeated.
- In the fourth example, ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow,"" indicating that ""red"" is the default color to repeat when ""wif"" is at the beginning, followed by another color (""zup"" is yellow).
- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf dax lug"" converts to ""red red green blue."" The ""bluf"" (red) immediately follows ""wif"" and is repeated until a new color ""dax"" (green), and then ""lug"" (blue) follow it.

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" can be articulated as follows:

Rule: When ""wif"" appears, repeat the color of the next word until another color word appears or until ""wif"" appears again, at which point the color of the word following the second ""wif"" should be repeated.

Written succinctly as a definition:
wif -> Repeat the next color until a different color or another ""wif"" appears.",1.0,194,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the word ""yellow."" The other words appear to correspond to different colors as well. Here is the breakdown:

Input: zup
Output: yellow
- Direct substitution: zup -> yellow

Input: zup wif zup
Output: yellow red yellow
- The pattern suggests: zup -> yellow, wif -> red

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green
- This example shows: zup -> yellow, bluf -> yellow (possibly meaning the same color as the word before it), dax -> green

Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
Output: yellow red red yellow blue
- Once again: zup -> yellow, wif -> red, bluf -> red (which changed from the previous example, suggesting an error in the provided translations, or that there might be some contextual rule we do not have enough examples to figure out), lug -> blue

Input: lug bluf zup
Output: blue blue yellow
- Here it's shown: lug -> blue, bluf -> blue (once more implying the color before it), zup -> yellow

Based on the instances provided only, if we disregard the inconsistency surrounding ""bluf"" and assume it was an error in example three, the simplest rule for ""zup"" can be established as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,194,zup

2. zup bluf dax lug - yellow yellow green blue
3. zup bluf wif walm - yellow yellow red red red
4. dax bluf - green green

3. ""zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow red red red""
4. ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green""
5. ""zup wif bluf zup"" results in ""yellow red red yellow""

From these examples, we can induce that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word in the sequence. So, if the word before ""bluf"" translates to ""blue,"" then ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue"" and so on.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I will compare the input and output pairs to identify a pattern.

Input: zup wif walm Output: yellow red red red
Input: dax walm wif Output: green green green red
Input: wif walm dax zup Output: red red red green yellow
Input: dax lug wif walm Output: green blue red red red
Input: wif walm Output: red red red

From these examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to three reds in the output, regardless of its position in the input. Another observation is that the other words correspond to a single color in the output: ""wif"" consistently corresponds to red, ""zup"" to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""lug"" to blue.

Rule: Regardless of position, ""walm"" corresponds to three consecutive reds in the output.

walm -> meaning: red red red",1.0,194,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's look at the context in which it appears and the corresponding outputs:

1. ""zup wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red red red."" The unique element when comparing with other inputs is ""zup,"" which uniquely corresponds to ""yellow."" Meanwhile, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" across all examples.

2. ""dax walm wif"" corresponds to ""green green green red."" Here ""dax"" is the unique element that must correspond to ""green,"" as ""wif"" is ""red"" consistently.

3. ""wif walm dax zup"" corresponds to ""red red red green yellow."" We have already established ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"" correspond to ""red,"" ""green,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. The order also matches.

4. ""dax lug wif walm"" corresponds to ""green blue red red red."" We know ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" and ""wif"" with ""red."" The new word ""lug"" must then correspond to ""blue.""

5. ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red."" With ""wif"" established as ""red,"" the repeated ""red"" suggests a reaffirmation or continuation of ""red.""

From these inputs and outputs, we can derive a consistent rule for ""walm,"" which is not influenced by the presence of other words such as ""zup,"" ""dax,"" or ""lug."" 

Rule: ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition or continuation of the color immediately preceding it, which in these examples is the color associated with ""wif,"" hence the repetition of ""red.""

Thus, walm -> meaning: a repetition or continuation of the preceding color.",1.0,194,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the outputs corresponding to the inputs that include ""walm"":

1. zup wif walm => yellow red red red
2. dax walm wif => green green green red
3. wif walm dax zup => red red red green yellow
4. dax lug wif walm => green blue red red red
5. wif walm => red red red

In every instance, the presence of ""walm"" leads to a sequence of ""red red red"". This sequence remains consistent regardless of what other words precede or follow ""walm"". When ""walm"" is used, other words in the input (""zup"", ""dax"", ""lug"", and ""wif"") correspond to their respective colors (yellow, green, blue, and red), but the sequence ""red red red"" follows the nonce word ""walm"" without being influenced by these other words.

Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the color red.",1.0,194,walm
"From the examples provided, we can try to deduce the rule governing the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by looking at the correlation between its occurrence and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

2. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

4. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red

5. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

Looking at the outputs, we see that ""red"" appears every time ""walm"" is in the input, with a consistent pattern of three ""red""s following ""walm"". The only exception is when another word follows ""walm"", then ""walm"" translates to two ""red""s and the word after ""walm"" contributes its own color.

So the rule seems to be that ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""red"" repeated three times unless a word follows ""walm"", in which case ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" repeated twice followed by the color that represents the word after ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> ""red red red"" (or ""red red"" if followed by another word which has its own associated color)",0.8,194,walm
"Observing the examples given, it seems that each unique word corresponds to a unique color:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

In each instance, ""walm"" is present, the color sequence includes three instances of red and then another color, except in the last example, where only ""wif"" and ""walm"" are present, resulting in three reds.

Let's analyze each usage of ""walm"" and the colors that follow it:

1. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
2. dax walm wif -> green green green red
3. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
4. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red
5. wif walm -> red red red

In examples 1, 3, and 4 where ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" the pattern ""red red red"" always follows regardless of the order. In example 2, where ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" there is a sequence of three greens but ends with a red — the same color as ""wif"" which comes right after. It seems that ""walm"" generates three instances of red unless followed by ""wif,"" where it instead generates three instances of the previous color before ending with red. The last example confirms that when ""walm"" is the final term, it results in three reds.

Based on this, we can deduce that:

Rule: ""walm"" means repeating the color immediately preceding it three times, but if ""wif"" (red) follows ""walm,"" then ""walm"" means repeating red three times regardless of the preceding color. If ""walm"" is the final word or is not followed by any other known color term, it defaults to red.

To articulate this:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the previous color three times, if followed by ""wif"", instead repeat red three times. If ""walm"" has no preceding color term or is not followed by a non-color term, default to red three times.",0.8,194,walm

- ""dax walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue""

- In all instances where ""lug"" appears, the output includes the word ""blue.""
- The presence of other nonce words such as ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax,"" which correspond to other colors, doesn't affect the translation of ""lug"" to ""blue.""
- When ""lug"" appears multiple times, as in the third example ""wif lug dax lug,"" it results in ""blue"" appearing multiple times in the output (""red blue green blue"").

"Based on the provided input and output examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

Let's analyze the data provided:

1. In the first example, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""blue red green green red blue"". Here ""wif"" appears twice and translates to ""red"" both times, which is nestled between pairs of colors that mirror each other (blue-green and green-blue).

2. In the second example, ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red"". Here, ""wif"" is at the end and translates to ""red"" once more. 

3. In the third example, which is simply ""wif"", it also translates to ""red"".

4. In the fourth example, ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax"" translates to ""red blue blue yellow yellow green"". The initial ""wif"" translates to ""red"".

5. Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"". Here, ""wif"" directly precedes ""bluf"" and both translate to ""red"".

From the data given, ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" irrespective of the word that precedes or follows it. One minor curiosity is that ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" despite ""bluf"" translating to ""blue"" in other contexts.

"Based on the provided examples, a pattern emerges where the output colors correspond to the input words. The sequence of outputs for ""wif bluf dax walm"" is consistent with the ""wif bluf dax walm lug"" example, with the exception of the last color, which corresponds to the new word ""lug.""

By examining the outputs corresponding to the known inputs and the nonce word ""walm,"" we can discern that ""walm"" is consistently translated to two outputs of the color green. Moreover, the color does not change dependent on the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence, as seen in the last two examples where its position changes.

Hence, we can deduce that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to two instances of the color green, regardless of its location in the input sequence.

So, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" is:

walm -> meaning. Rule: ""walm"" corresponds to two green colors in the output sequence.",1.0,195,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the correlation between the input and output:

- In every example where ""walm"" appears, the output is ""green"" repeated.
- The number of green outputs following ""walm"" seems to correspond to the number of times ""walm"" appears in the input.
- No other word in the input causes repeated green outputs.

From this, we can infer that ""walm"" causes a repeated ""green"" output. The number of repetitions equals the number of times ""walm"" occurs consecutively in the input.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the word ""green"" in the output as many times as ""walm"" occurs consecutively in the input.",1.0,195,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to multiple occurrences of the color ""green"" in the output. Every instance of ""walm"" within an input results in two consecutive ""green"" in the output.

Rule: walm -> two consecutive ""green"" in the output.",1.0,195,walm
"From the given examples, we can derive the meaning of ""walm"" by looking at the consistent patterns of the output relative to its position and surrounding words.

In the first example:
- Input: wif bluf dax walm
- Output: red red green green green

We see that ""walm"" yields a sequence of three green colors in the output.

In the second example (comparison to the first one shows ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue""):
- Input: zup wif dax walm lug
- Output: yellow red green green green blue

Here ""walm"" again results in three greens, despite additional words before and after.

In the third example:
- Input: wif bluf dax walm
- Output: red red green green green

This is identical to the first example and the output is the same, reinforcing the observed pattern.

In the fourth example:
- Input: wif walm dax zup
- Output: red red red green yellow

Here ""walm"" appears earlier in the sequence but still leads to a repetition of red in the output.

In the fifth example:
- Input: dax walm wif walm
- Output: green green green red red red

""walm"" follows ""dax"", leading to green, but also precedes ""wif"", transforming both the preceding color and the following into red.

Looking at the patterns, it seems that ""walm"" affects the color output related to the word that comes after it, repeating it three times. If ""walm"" happens to be the last word, it repeats the color associated with itself.

Thus, the rule could be interpreted as:

Rule: When ""walm"" precedes a word, it causes the output color for that word to be repeated three times. If ""walm"" is the last word in a sequence, it repeats the color associated with ""walm"" three times.

Alternatively, if ""walm"" has an intrinsic color associated with it, that color appears to be green, as observed when ""walm"" is in the last position.

So, we can conclude:

walm -> when followed by another word or at the end of a sequence, it causes the color of the word following it (or its own color if at the end) to be repeated three times.

Given the consistency across examples, the rule is likely accurate, but additional examples might further confirm or refine this rule.",0.9,195,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the given examples, let's analyze the input and the corresponding output color patterns.

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red

There is a one-to-one correspondence between the input words and the output colors except for the word ""walm,"" which appears once or twice in the input but consistently corresponds with two or three greens in the output. Notice that the sequence of green after ""walm"" is equivalent to the number of times ""walm"" occurs multiplied by the instances of ""dax"" before it.

Let's look closer:

1. In every instance where ""walm"" appears, the following color is green.
2. The word ""walm"" is always followed by green, no matter where it occurs in the sequence.
3. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the greens double, indicating that ""walm"" might replicate the output color associated with the word that precedes it.
4. When ""walm"" appears in succession, it replicates the green associated with ""dax"" and then replicates the color associated with itself, resulting in a series of greens.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> means replicate the output color of the previous word, with green being the default when it follows ""dax.""

So, in essence:

walm -> meaning: replicate the output color of the previous word (default: green after ""dax"").",0.9,195,walm

- Regardless of the position of ""walm"" in the input, the pattern remains unchanged; it doesn't matter what precedes it.
- The other words in the input correspond to different single color outputs: ""lug"" results in ""blue"", ""zup"" results in ""yellow"", ""wif"" results in ""red"", and ""dax"" results in ""green"". These words result in the output of one instance of their corresponding color, while ""walm"" is always followed by ""yellow"" repeated three times.

1. wif corresponds to the color red

To verify:

- In the first example, 'zup' appears twice and the color yellow appears exactly where 'zup' is in the input sequence.
- In all other examples, 'zup' consistently corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position or the words around it.

Therefore, the rule we can infer is:

3. ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of ""blue"" or ""yellow"" depending on whether it is preceded by ""lug"" or not.
4. ""dax"" results in the color ""green.""

So, the colors seem to correspond directly to mentioned words. Importantly, wherever ""zup"" appears, ""yellow"" follows:

- When ""zup"" appears alone with ""wif,"" the output is ""yellow red.""
- When ""zup"" appears twice in a sequence with other words between them, each ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""zup"" inside a sequence of ""walm"" words also results in the outputs containing additional ""yellow"" without altering the sequence of ""blue.""

Thus, the rule seems to be simply that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,197,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at the correspondence between the input and output in each example:

2. Input: lug walm zup walm

   ""lug"" maps to blue, ""walm"" to yellow. ""zup"" follows ""walm"" and turns into yellow.

3. Input: zup wif

   ""zup"" as the first word maps to yellow and ""wif"" to red.

4. Input: wif dax zup dax

   ""wif"" corresponds to red, each ""dax"" to green. ""zup"" here follows ""dax"" and is yellow.

5. Input: lug walm zup

Based on the patterns above, it seems that ""zup"" translates to the color yellow regardless of what word precedes it, except when it directly follows ""dax,"" which means that the word after ""dax"" is always green. 

So, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be that it typically translates to the color yellow, but its color changes if certain conditions are met with the preceding word, like following ""dax.""

- In the fifth example, ""lug"" maps to ""blue"" and is followed by ""bluf"", which outputs ""blue"".

The second and fourth examples also support this rule, but they include an additional color word after ""bluf"", which remains consistent with its regular mapping.

- ""wif"" results in ""red""
- ""bluf"" results in another ""red""
- ""dax"" results in ""green""
- ""walm"" results in two additional occurrences of ""green""

From these examples, it appears that the rule for ""walm"" is dependent on the identity of the word that precedes it. ""Walm"" seems to duplicate the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it two more times. Thus, we can draft the rule as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> duplicates the color of the preceding word two additional times.

So, if the preceding word results in the color ""red,"" ""walm"" results in ""red red."" If the preceding word is ""green,"" ""walm"" leads to ""green green,"" and so on.",0.9,197,walm

Now, let's analyze the occurrences of ""walm"":
- After ""walm,"" the color pattern always starts with red and then continues with green in example 1 and 5, or duplicates of the color right after ""walm"" in examples 2 and 3.
- In example 4, ""walm"" is last and followed by one red, but we can't establish the rest of the pattern as there is nothing to continue with.
- ""Walm"" never has a color directly associated with it; it always impacts the words after it.

Given these observations, let's formulate what ""walm"" seems to mean:

Rule: ""walm"" appears to transform subsequent words and not itself. It turns the next word into ""red"" and then either continues with a sequence of ""green"" or repeats the color of the next-to-next word if there is one. If it is followed by a word that has not yet been mapped to a color output, it repeats the color of the word right after ""walm"".

Thus, we can summarize the rule for ""walm"" this way:

walm -> meaning: A rule-based modifier that changes the next word's color to red and subsequent words to either green or replicates the color of the following distinct word. If it's the last word, it outputs red for whatever would hypothetically follow.",0.8,197,walm
"Rule: walm -> green repeated as many times as the previous color repeat plus one.

Explanation of Rule Induction:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red **green green green**
   - Here, 'dax' causes the color green to appear once. When 'walm' follows, green is repeated three times (one more than red, which appears twice before it).

2. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red **red blue yellow**
   - After 'wif' we have red repeated twice, so when 'walm' appears, red is repeated one more time, for a total of three.

3. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red **red red yellow blue** yellow yellow yellow
   - After 'wif' red is repeated once. 'Walm' then adds two more reds. The second 'walm' appears after a single yellow, and we get yellow repeated twice to give us three yellows in total.

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red **red red**
   - 'Wif' generates a single red. 'Walm' increases the count by one, leading to two additional reds.

5. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green **green green**
   - The color green appears once with 'dax', and subsequently 'walm' generates two more greens for a total of three.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that the nonce word 'walm' causes the output color to be repeated as many times as the last color was repeated plus one additional instance.",0.8,197,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we examine the output colors associated with the word in each example. It appears that when ""walm"" is present, the output consists of a series of repeating colors with the first color being 'green' and additional colors following in a pattern.

Let's assess each occurrence of ""walm"":

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - We note that 'wif' maps to 'red', 'bluf' maps to 'red', and 'dax' maps to 'green'. After 'walm' occurs, the color 'green' repeats twice.

2. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   - 'Dax' is 'green', 'wif' is 'red', and after 'walm', 'red' is repeated once, followed by unique colors.

3. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - 'Wif' maps to 'red' and after the first 'walm', the color 'red' is repeated twice. After the second 'walm', 'yellow' is repeated three times, which corresponds to the previous color for 'zup'.

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - 'Zup' maps to 'yellow', 'wif' to 'red' and after 'walm' the color 'red' repeats twice.

5. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   - 'Wif' maps to 'red', 'lug' to 'blue', 'dax' to 'green', and post 'walm' the color 'green' repeats twice.

From these examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color represented by the preceding word to repeat a number of times. The specific number of repetitions is not consistent across examples, and there might be an influencing factor not immediately apparent from the given examples.

Given the data, we can tentatively define ""walm"" as causing a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, with varying repetition counts.

Rule: walm -> causes a repetition of color associated with the preceding word. The specific number of repeats may vary or depend on a rule not provided in the examples.",0.7,197,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce a rule for the nonce word ""walm"" by looking at its position within the sequences of inputs and the corresponding color outputs. We need to identify a pattern in color sequences associated with the occurrence of ""walm.""

Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   In this example, after ""walm,"" we have three green outputs.

2. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   We can observe that ""walm"" is followed by a red, then a color sequence not seen previously: blue, then yellow.

3. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Here, ""walm"" is followed immediately by a yellow then a blue, and by another set of yellows after the second ""walm.""

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   The occurrence of ""walm"" results in a sequence of red outputs.

5. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   Similar to the first example, ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of green outputs.

From the given examples, it looks like ""walm"" could be functioning as a rule-changer for the color outputs that follow it. One possibility is that ""walm"" requires the next color to be repeated multiple times or initiates a new sequence of colors that does not directly correspond to the individual input words seen prior to ""walm.""

Since there is a variation in the number of repetitions and the specific colors that follow ""walm,"" we cannot define a consistent sequence of colors that directly follows ""walm.""

Thus, the rule could be that ""walm"" triggers a change in the sequence of color outputs, but the exact nature of this change varies between examples.

Rule: walm -> initiates a variable sequence or repetition of color outputs, with the specifics of this sequence depending on the context not established by the given examples.",0.3,197,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the outputs. Therefore, we can deduce the meaning of ""lug"" in this context as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,198,lug
lug -> blue.,1.0,198,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following mappings from the input to the output colors:

- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> red
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- walm -> blue (repeated as many times as it appears)

The word ""lug"" consistently maps to the color blue in all examples. Therefore, we can deduce that:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,198,lug
lug -> blue,1.0,198,lug
lug -> blue,1.0,198,lug
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to a specific color in the output. The color associated with ""dax"" is consistently green, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input string or the other words around it.

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule for the meaning of ""dax"":

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,198,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Every occurrence of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,198,dax
"Based on the examples provided:

- When the input is ""dax"" alone, the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" precedes other words such as ""zup"" or ""bluf,"" it still corresponds to ""green,"" while those other words correspond to different colors (e.g., ""zup"" -> ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" -> ""yellow"").
- In sequences where ""dax"" appears more than once, each occurrence of ""dax"" always maps to ""green,"" regardless of its position or the other words present.
- Other words such as ""lug"" and ""walm"" also correspond to specific colors (""lug"" -> ""blue,"" ""walm"" -> ""blue""), and the correspondence remains consistent irrespective of the presence of ""dax.""
- The word ""wif"" is not followed by ""green"" and corresponds to a different color (""red"").

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present. Other words correspond to their own specific colors, but ""dax"" always means ""green.""

dax -> green",1.0,198,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green.""

Thus, the rule appears to be straightforward:

"Observing the sequences and their corresponding outputs, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" Regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that surround it, ""dax"" always results in the color green.

"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red."" In each instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, the term ""red"" is present in the output corresponding to the position of ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

"wif -> red

Rule: Regardless of context, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"".",1.0,198,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"". There does not appear to be any context-dependent variation; ""wif"" is directly replaced with ""red"" regardless of its position in the input string. Therefore, the rule is straightforward:

- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"", indicating ""bluf"" repeats the color from ""wif"", which is ""red"".
- ""lug bluf dax bluf"" translates to ""blue blue green green"", where ""bluf"" first takes the color ""blue"" from ""lug"", and then takes ""green"" from ""dax"".
- ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red"", where ""bluf"" here repeats the color from ""wif"", which is ""red"".
- ""wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow"", indicating that ""bluf"" here means ""yellow"", the color from the word ""zup"" before it.",1.0,198,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns in the examples provided:

1. (zup lug zup bluf lug) -> (yellow blue yellow yellow blue)
2. (wif bluf) -> (red red)
3. (lug bluf dax bluf) -> (blue blue green green)
4. (dax wif bluf) -> (green red red)
5. (wif dax zup bluf) -> (red green yellow yellow)

From the examples, we can notice that the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" is always repeated in the output. Following this pattern:

1. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" is translated to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue,"" where ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" and ""yellow"" is the color that is repeated.
2. ""wif bluf"" is translated to ""red red,"" where ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and ""red"" is repeated.
3. ""lug bluf dax bluf"" is translated to ""blue blue green green,"" with ""lug"" and ""dax"" preceding each occurrence of ""bluf,"" leading to the repetition of ""blue"" and ""green"" respectively.
4. ""dax wif bluf"" is translated to ""green red red,"" where ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" resulting in ""red"" being repeated.
5. ""wif dax zup bluf"" is translated to ""red green yellow yellow,"" with ""zup"" preceding ""bluf"" and ""yellow"" being repeated.

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning is that the color word corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" will be repeated once.

Rule: ""bluf"" indicates that the word (color) immediately before ""bluf"" should be repeated in the output.",1.0,198,bluf
Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that immediately precedes it.,1.0,198,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Here's the analysis of the examples:

1. zup lug zup bluf lug
   - Translation: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" becomes ""yellow.""

2. wif bluf
   - Translation: red red
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which translates to ""red,"" so ""bluf"" becomes ""red.""

3. lug bluf dax bluf
   - Translation: blue blue green green
   - The first ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which translates to ""blue,"" so the first ""bluf"" becomes ""blue.""
   - The second ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which translates to ""green,"" so the second ""bluf"" becomes ""green.""

4. dax wif bluf
   - Translation: green red red
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which translates to ""red,"" so ""bluf"" becomes ""red.""

5. wif dax zup bluf
   - Translation: red green yellow yellow
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" becomes ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color of the word preceding it. If the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""red""; if it's ""lug,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""blue""; if it's ""zup,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow""; if it's ""dax,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""green.""",1.0,198,bluf
"Given the examples:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
2. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

4. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green

5. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red

We can observe that the output color corresponding to the word ""walm"" repetitively matches the color preceding it. ""Walm"" does not seem to have a color of its own, but rather continues the sequence of colors stated before it. This can be further supported by the fact that regardless of whether ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" ""zup,"" or ""dax,"" which correspond to ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""green"" respectively, the color mentioned after ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" repeats the color of the word before it.",1.0,198,walm
"From the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color word preceding it. This is evident because when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue"", and when it follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"". Therefore, ""walm"" seems to indicate that the color word before it is to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the preceding color word three times.",1.0,198,walm
"Rule: walm translates to repeating the color associated with the word immediately before it three times. If ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated three times. If ""zup"" or ""dax"" precede ""walm,"" the colors ""yellow"" and ""green"" are repeated three times, respectively. ""Wif,"" which outputs ""red,"" has not preceded ""walm"" in the given examples, therefore it is undetermined whether ""walm"" would repeat the color ""red"" three times, but it is likely given the pattern.",1.0,198,walm
"Examining the provided examples, I'll analyze the pattern between the input and the output:

- Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue (walm leads to the repetition of the color associated with the previously mentioned word 'lug')
- Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif -> Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red (again, walm triggers the repetition of 'blue'; the pattern maintains throughout with the other words)
- Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green (walm causes 'green' to repeat)
- Input: zup walm dax -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green (walm is associated with repeated 'yellow' then the pattern continues with 'dax'->'green')
- Input: lug walm wif -> Output: blue blue blue red (walm leads to the repetition of 'blue' and then 'wif'->'red')

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" is a command or function that repeats the color associated with the previous word the same number of times as the word ""walm"" appears. If ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" ""zug"" with ""yellow,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""dax"" with ""green,"" the rule is that when ""walm"" immediately follows any of those, the color of the preceding word is repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,198,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can examine the patterns and correlations in the examples given.

From the first example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" The word ""lug"" is repeated once, and ""blue"" is repeated three times; however, without further context, it's challenging to derive the meaning of ""walm"" from this alone.

The second example, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" translates into ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red."" Here, we see the pattern that ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" with ""red."" Notably, after ""walm"" is introduced, the pattern continues with the color associated with the word that follows ""walm."" For instance, ""zup"" follows ""walm"" and the pattern continues with ""yellow.""

The third example, ""wif bluf dax walm,"" oddly translates into ""red red green green green,"" despite ""bluf"" not having been associated with any color previously. This seems to break the pattern a bit but let's look for more consistency with further examples.

The fourth example, ""zup walm dax,"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green,"" which indicates that ""walm"" is followed by a word that maps to a color and the output color repeats for as many times as the number of letters in the color word.

The fifth and final example, ""lug walm wif,"" translates to ""blue blue blue red,"" which again supports the idea that ""walm"" affects the output of the color repetition based on the word that follows it.

Combining these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" might cause the subsequent word's associated color to be repeated a number of times based on the number of letters in the color name:

- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" - ""blue"" has four letters, thus repeated three times.
- ""zup walm dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green"" - ""yellow"" has six letters, so ""yellow"" is said three times then followed by ""green"" for ""dax.""
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" being ""red red green green green"" is still not perfectly clear, but it could be that ""bluf"" is an unrecognized input which defaults to repeating the color of the previous recognised input (""wif"" -> ""red""), but this isn't a solid rule and would require additional examples to confirm.
  
Given the data, it is most consistent to conclude that ""walm"" influences the following word to have its associated color repeated three times, disregarding the third example as an anomaly or considering that there might be an additional rule for ""bluf"" that isn't adequately represented in the examples.

Therefore, wif -> red.",1.0,199,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let us look at the examples and corresponding outputs:

1. When ""wif"" is adjacent to ""walm,"" the output is red for ""wif"" and yellow for ""walm"":
   - Example: ""wif walm zup walm"" -> Output: ""red red red yellow yellow yellow""

2. ""wif"" on its own outputs red:
   - Example: ""wif"" -> Output: ""red""

3. When ""wif"" is between ""lug"" and ""bluf,"" it outputs red, ""lug"" outputs blue, and ""bluf"" outputs blue:
   - Example: ""lug wif lug bluf"" -> Output: ""blue red blue blue""

4. When ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"" and ""dax,"" ""wif"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""dax"" is green:
   - Example: ""wif zup dax"" -> Output: ""red yellow green""

5. When ""wif"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""walm,"" ""walm"" following a ""wif"" is red, while ""lug"" is blue and ""zup"" is yellow:
   - Example: ""dax wif walm lug zup"" -> Output: ""green red red red blue yellow""

From these observations, it is consistently seen that ""wif"" translates to red irrespective of its position or the words surrounding it. The other words seem to have their individual colors regardless of ""wif."" Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,199,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

Each instance of the word ""wif"" in the provided inputs results in ""red"" in the corresponding outputs, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,199,wif
"Based on the examples provided, wif seems to be associated with the output ""red."" We can deduce this by looking for consistency in the input-to-output transformation for each instance of ""wif.""

1. When ""wif"" is presented alone (Input: wif), the output is ""red"".
2. When ""wif"" is alongside other words such as ""walm,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" or ""dax,"" it still elicits ""red"" for every occurrence of ""wif.""

Additionally, other words in the examples appear to correspond to their own colors:
- ""walm"" appears to correspond to the color ""red"" as well.
- ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green.""

In every instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, regardless of the context or the position of ""wif"" in the sequence, the output is consistently ""red.""

Therefore, the rule that can be induced is:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""",1.0,199,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by comparing the input and the output sequences.

- Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.

Thus, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" is:

Thus, we can roughly summarize the rule as:
bluf -> The color of the word that immediately follows bluf.",1.0,199,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to consider its occurrences and the outputs corresponding to those occurrences. We can take into account the other words, their positions, and the colors they correspond to.

Each occurrence of ""bluf"" in the input sequences is followed by a color in the output sequences. The color that follows ""bluf"" in the output is always the same color that corresponds to the immediately preceding word in the input. Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" Hence, ""bluf"" could mean to repeat the color of the word before it, which is yellow in this case.
- In the second example, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" becomes ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" Again, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the output is ""blue blue,"" indicating the same rule.
- The third example, ""dax bluf zup,"" translates to ""green green yellow."" As before, the output for ""bluf"" is green, the same as the preceding word ""dax.""
- Similarly, the fourth example, ""zup dax bluf zup dax,"" gives us ""yellow green green yellow green."" The ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and is represented as green in the output.
- The fifth example, ""wif bluf zup bluf wif,"" results in ""red red yellow yellow red."" Each occurrence of ""bluf"" follows the color of the previously mentioned word in the output.

From the given examples, the rule for ""bluf"" can be induced as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color corresponding to the word immediately before it in the input sequence.

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,199,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color that corresponds to the word that precedes it. If ""bluf"" is the first word, it uses the color that corresponds to the next word.

Examples to demonstrate the rule:
- ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""bluf"" also becomes yellow.
- ""lug bluf wif"" results in ""blue blue red"" because ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so the ""bluf"" that follows becomes blue. ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""dax bluf zup"" results in ""green green yellow"" because ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" becomes green, followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow.
- ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"" results in ""red red yellow yellow red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""bluf"" becomes red, followed by ""zup,"" corresponding to yellow; the next ""bluf"" also becomes yellow, and the pattern completes with another ""wif"" for red.

Bluf -> the color corresponding to the preceding word (or following if it's the first word).",1.0,199,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Meaning appears to be 'repeat the color of the previous word'. Rule: When bluf is encountered, it takes on the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,199,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color that appears directly following it in the input sequence. 

For example, in ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" takes on the meaning of ""yellow"" in the output. Similarly, in ""lug bluf wif,"" ""wif"" means ""red,"" so in this context, ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

Thus, bluf -> the color that follows it in the sequence.",0.0,199,bluf
"Rule: The word ""walm"" appears to correspond to a repetition of a color word three times in the output. The specific color repeated is determined by the word that precedes ""walm"":

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" so ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" so ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" so ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

When ""walm"" is used after a color-indicating word, the output is three repetitions of the color associated with that word.

Therefore, the rule is:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,199,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates repetition of the color word that immediately follows it in the input, three times in the output. 

For example:
- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue""
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue"" (where ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color ""red"" which is implied by ""wif"", and ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"")
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green""
- ""lug walm zup walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"" (each instance of ""walm"" causes the repetition of the immediately preceding color)",1.0,199,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

In each example, ""walm"" follows a word, and the output is the color associated with that word repeated three times.

- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" (zup is associated with yellow)
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" (lug is associated with blue)
- ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red"" (wif is associated with red)
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"" (dax is associated with green)
- ""lug walm zup walm"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"" (lug is associated with blue, zup is associated with yellow)",1.0,199,walm
"Rule: walm -> the word walm seems to correspond to repeating the color word that immediately follows it three times. If no color word follows, it defaults to the color mentioned before it.

- ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"" (zup means yellow).
- ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"" (lug means blue).
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" corresponds to ""red red red blue blue"" (wif means red, and lug means blue).
- ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green"" (dax means green).
- ""lug walm zup walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"" (lug means blue, zup means yellow).",1.0,199,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to result in repeated color words, with the specific color determined by the word that comes immediately before ""walm"". Here is the pattern observed:

- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> ""red red red blue blue""
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""

Each occurrence of ""walm"" results in a trio of a color word. The color word is determined by the word that precedes ""walm"":

- ""zup"" preceding ""walm"" generates ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- ""lug"" preceding ""walm"" generates ""blue blue blue"".
- ""wif"" preceding ""walm"" generates ""red red red"".
- ""dax"" preceding ""walm"" generates ""green green green"".

Additionally, the presence of ""bluf"" after ""lug walm"" does not repeat the color three times but emits it twice instead. It could be that ""lug"" directly followed by ""walm"" results in three repetitions of ""blue"", whereas ""bluf"" does not have the same effect of tripling the output.

Considering the preceding color indicator and the immediate next word not altering the effect, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> When preceded by a word, it generates that word's corresponding color repeated three times.",1.0,199,walm
