"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of the word ""dax"" by comparing its position and usage with the corresponding output:

Input: dax lug wif
Output: green blue red
Here, ""dax"" precedes ""lug"" and the output starts with ""green"".

Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
Output: green blue yellow red red green
Here, ""dax"" is at the beginning and end of the sequence. The output correspondingly starts and ends with ""green"".

Input: dax lug wif lug
Output: green blue red blue
Again, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"" and the output starts with ""green"". 

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
Here, ""dax"" appears at the end and the output, correspondingly, ends with ""green"".

Input: wif dax lug
Output: red green blue
Here, ""dax"" is in the middle and followed by ""lug""; the output is ""red green blue"" where ""green"" is in the middle.

From these examples, we can induce that the occurrence of the word ""dax"" maps to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears at the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine how it appears in the input and what the corresponding output is for those instances.

- In example 1, when ""bluf"" is between two ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow red red yellow."" Given that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" both before and after ""bluf,"" it could imply that ""bluf"" results in repeating the color ""red"" for each occurrence of ""bluf.""

- In example 2, ""bluf"" appears after ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green."" This pattern further supports the rule from the first example since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" based on other examples, suggesting that ""bluf"" must be generating a double of the preceding color.

- In example 3, ""bluf"" appears followed by ""wif lug wif walm lug,"" and the corresponding output is ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" Since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" is both preceded and followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" we again see the doubling effect.

- In example 4, ""bluf"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif lug."" The output for ""dax bluf"" is ""green green,"" and the output for ""wif lug"" is ""red blue."" Since this maintains the consistent output for ""dax"" and ""lug,"" it suggests that ""bluf"" is consistent in its effect.

- In example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""zup wif,"" and the output is ""yellow red red."" Considering that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" we are again seeing a pattern where ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the color that directly precedes it.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> ""bluf"" results in the output repeating the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning: bluf causes the word immediately prior to ""bluf"" to be outputted twice.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that comes directly before it three times. Each nonce word except ""walm"" seems to correlate with a specific color:

- ""wif"" correlates with the color red.
- ""zup"" correlates with the color yellow.
- ""dax"" correlates with the color green.
- ""lug"" correlates with the color blue.

Therefore, when ""walm"" follows any of these words, the color linked to the preceding word is repeated thrice in the output.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" seems to be consistent. In each instance, the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" 

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green every time it is mentioned.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" appears to correlate with the color ""red."" In every example where ""wif"" is mentioned, the corresponding output is the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Each time ""zup"" occurs in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.

zup -> meaning. Meaning: yellow

Rule: Each occurrence of ""zup"" in the input results in ""yellow"" in the output.
Rule: bluf -> red when it follows wif, otherwise it means blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to examine the patterns in the given examples. Let's take a closer look at each instance where ""walm"" appears and its output:

1. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   
2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   
3. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   
4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   
5. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow

From the examples given, it seems that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word just before ""walm"" three times. For instance:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""

Moreover, ""walm"" does not appear on its own; it always directly follows another word. There are no counterexamples given to suggest that ""walm"" has any other function.

Hence, we can deduce:

walm -> meaning. Rule: ""walm"" is a function that repeats the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup
    ",Output: red yellow,red yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word 'dax' corresponds to the color green.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that each word translates to a specific color:

- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""walm"" translates to ""blue"" when following other words (except when preceded directly by ""wif""), otherwise ""red""

Using these translations, we see that ""wif"" is always followed by the color ""red"" in the output. However, a noticeable pattern is that when ""wif"" is immediately followed by a word that corresponds to a color, the output color for ""wif"" is ""red"", and the word after ""wif"" retains its respective color. This is consistent across all examples. Thus, ""wif"" acts as a color indicator that does not change the subsequent word's color.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". The evidence for this is consistent across all examples as every occurrence of ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: *bluf* means to repeat the color associated with the previous word. If there is no prior word with an associated color, *bluf* translates to yellow.

- In example one, ""wif"" is red, so ""bluf"" repeats red.
- In example two, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is red, hence ""bluf"" is red.
- In example three, ""bluf"" has no preceding color word, thus it defaults to yellow.
- In example four, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is yellow, thus ""bluf"" is yellow.
- In example five, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which is green, thus ""bluf"" is green.
Rule: The word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of a color word three times. The specific color word that is repeated is determined by the word that precedes ""walm"":

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", indicating that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", indicating that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" takes the color associated with the previous word and repeats it three times.

walm -> repeat the preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we can analyze the input-output pairs provided and look for patterns associated with the word ""dax.""

From the examples provided, we observe the following associations:

1. Every time ""dax"" appears at the beginning or end of a sequence, or follows the word ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
2. When other non-""dax"" words are present between instances of ""dax,"" we can infer the following associated colors:
   - ""lug"" is associated with ""blue""
   - ""wif"" is associated with ""red""
   - ""bluf"" is consistently associated with ""green""
   - ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" is associated with ""red""

Based on these observations and focusing solely on instances of ""dax,"" it can be deduced that the word ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red 

Each instance of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in each given example.
Bluf -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""bluf"" appears to depend on the context of the word preceding it. The output is determined by the following rule:

- If the word before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" the corresponding output is ""yellow yellow.""
- If the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" the corresponding output is ""red red.""
- If the word before ""bluf"" is ""lug,"" the corresponding output is ""blue.""
- If the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" the corresponding output is ""blue.""

Rule: The word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that comes directly before it. However, if the word before ""bluf"" is ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, ""bluf"" translates to just one instance of the color ""blue"" rather than repeating it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the examples provided:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which generates the output ""blue,"" the following colors are all ""blue.""
2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which generates the output ""green,"" the following colors are all ""green.""
3. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which generates the output ""red,"" the following colors are ""red.""

These examples suggest that ""walm"" operates as a modifier, causing every item following it to take on the color of the item preceding it, until a new color word appears.

Rule: walm -> causes the subsequent outputs to repeat the color of the preceding item until a new color word occurs.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Rule: lug means blue.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

Input: zup lug dax lug
Output: yellow blue green blue

Input: zup lug zup dax
Output: yellow blue yellow green

Input: wif dax
Output: red green

Input: zup dax lug wif dax
Output: yellow green blue red green

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red

In each of the examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Therefore, we can infer that the meaning of ""dax"" is ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the provided examples.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Regardless of its position in the input sequence, the presence of ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" in the corresponding position in the output sequence. Therefore:

zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
bluf -> red

Rule: Each instance of ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence.
To induce the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in the inputs and outputs.

- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" This suggests that ""walm"" could mean to triple the color associated with the previous word.
- ""lug walm zup walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and ""zup,"" tripling the output of the color associated with each.
- ""lug wif dax walm zup"" translates to ""blue red green green green yellow."" Once again, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in ""green"" being tripled.
- ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green."" After ""wif,"" which is translated to ""red,"" ""walm"" results in tripling the color ""red.""
- ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" After ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" ""walm"" triples the color ""red.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" triples the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it. 

Rule: walm -> Triples the color associated with the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Here are the observed correspondences:
- Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the output.
- The word ""dax"" by itself corresponds to a single ""green"" in the output.
- The presence of other words such as ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""walm,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup"" correspond to other colors (""red,"" ""red,"" ""green,"" ""blue,"" and ""yellow"" respectively).

Therefore, the meaning assigned to the nonce word ""dax"" in this context is the color ""green.""

Rule:
dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
Based on the given examples, the word “zup” appears to correspond to the word ""yellow"" in the outputs. The word following ""zup"" determines how many additional ""yellow""s are included before a different color (if any) is appended to the output sequence. Here is the pattern observed:

- “walm” seems to correspond to two additional ""yellow""s.
- “wif” seems to correspond to a ""red"" at the end of the sequence.
- ""bluf"" seems to correspond to one additional ""yellow"".

Thus, the rule induced from the examples would be:

- zup -> yellow
- zup followed by ""walm"" -> two additional yellows (for a total of three yellows)
- zup followed by ""wif"" -> red at the end
- zup followed by ""bluf"" -> one additional yellow (for a total of two yellows)

Rule: When ""zup"" is used alone, it corresponds to a single instance of ""yellow."" When ""zup"" is followed by another word, the number and type of colors in the output depend on the specific word that follows “zup.”
bluf -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color of the immediately preceding word in the sequence. Here's the deduction:

- In the first example, ""lug"" is translated as ""blue,"" and when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue"" again.
- In the second example, ""dax"" is translated as ""green,"" and when ""walm"" follows, the output is ""green"" again.
- Similarly, in the subsequent examples, whatever color ""walm"" follows, it repeats that same color.

Thus, we can surmise:

Walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, it takes on the color corresponding to that word repeatably.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Rule: lug translates to ""blue."" The word preceding lug indicates a different color, but lug consistently corresponds to ""blue"" regardless of the context.
dax -> rule. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Every time ""dax"" is present in the input, the output includes ""green."" This relationship appears to be consistent regardless of the other words accompanying ""dax.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" results in the output repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Here are the associations observed from the examples:
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow""
- ""wif"" is associated with ""red""
- ""dax"" is associated with ""green""

In each instance where ""bluf"" is used, the color word that comes out in the output is a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. For example, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"" and ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"". This also holds true when multiple words precede and follow ""bluf"", as shown in the example ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" which results in ""green green red yellow green"". Here, ""green"" is repeated because it is the color associated with ""dax"" that comes before ""bluf"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word. Rule: When bluf is used, output the color corresponding to the word before it, twice.
Analyzing the examples provided, we can create a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

1. In every output, the word ""walm"" corresponds to green except for the number of greens, which vary according to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.
2. When ""walm"" is the second word, as in ""dax walm,"" there are three green outputs.
3. When ""walm"" is preceded by one or more non-""dax"" words, there is only one green output followed by reds or other colors corresponding to those words if ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" (red), or blues if ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence after ""lug"" (blue).
4. ""dax"" seems to be associated with green every time it appears in the input, while ""walm"" adds a varying number of additional greens depending on its position and what precedes it.

From this, we can induce that ""walm"" relates to the color green, but the exact number of greens it generates in the output seems to be influenced by its position relative to other words, particularly ""dax"" and their meaning in terms of color.

Based on the examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Generates an output of ""green,"" with the number of greens dependent on its position and the words that come before it. Specifically, if ""walm"" directly follows ""dax,"" it results in a sequence of three greens. If ""walm"" is preceded by any other words, it results in one green. The colors that follow the green(s) depend on the words coming after ""walm."" If there is a ""wif"" after ""walm,"" it will be red, and if there is ""lug,"" it will be blue. If ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, it ends with green followed by other colors corresponding to the preceding words or a single blue if followed by ""lug"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the given examples, each instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output. The other words must correspond to their respective colors as well, but since the task is focused on the word ""dax,"" we can ignore those for now.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that the word ""dax"" translates directly to the color ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can infer that each word corresponds to a specific color. Matching each input to its output, we deduce the following color associations:

- Dax corresponds to green
- Lug corresponds to blue
- Bluf corresponds to red, but seeing that ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" in the second example, this might need further examples to clarify. For now, we'll assume bluf is red.
- Wif corresponds to red

By analyzing the patterns, we can conclude:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the outputs. Here is the evidence supporting this conclusion:

- In every example where ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- The position of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to the position of ""yellow"" in the output.
- There are instances where ""zup"" is the only word in the input that has a corresponding ""yellow"" in the output, ruling out dependence on context or surrounding words.

Therefore, the rule is:
zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the provided inputs and outputs, it appears the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" The outputs consistently show the word ""blue"" in the position where ""bluf"" appears in the inputs. Specifically, whenever ""bluf"" is mentioned, the corresponding output is the word ""blue,"" regardless of the context provided by the surrounding words.

So, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> blue.
Based on the examples provided, we can infer that the nonce word ""walm"" refers to a repetition of the color word that directly precedes it in the series. To determine the specific number of repetitions, we observe the output for the number of times the previous color word is repeated after ""walm"" is introduced.

Here's the analysis:

1. In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" which indicates that ""lug"" (blue) is repeated three times.

2. In the second example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" indicating that ""dax"" (green) is also repeated three times.

3. In the third example, ""lug walm"" again results in ""blue blue blue,"" supporting the rule that ""walm"" causes a thrice repetition of the preceding color.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup walm wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow red red red,"" demonstrating that ""walm"" repeats ""zup"" (yellow) three times and then, when it appears again after ""wif,"" it repeats ""wif"" (red) three times.

5. In the fifth example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" results in a sequence where ""walm"" follows after ""wif"" and the sequence ""red red red"" appears, again showing a thrice repetition of the preceding color word ""wif"" (red).

Therefore, we conclude that:

walm -> When walm appears after a color word, it causes that color word to be repeated three more times.

Rule: If X represents a color word (e.g., lug is blue, wif is red), then ""X walm"" translates to ""X X X X"" in the output.

    Rules:

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in all given examples.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" appears to have a consistent meaning of ""green."" Every instance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output. There are no examples given where ""dax"" led to any output other than ""green,"" and the last example shows ""dax"" on its own yielding ""green."" 

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Every instance of ""zup"" in the input results in ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the word ""blue"" when it is preceded by ""lug."" However, when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" or ""zup,"" it does not correspond to ""blue"" but rather repeats the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. 

Rule:
- If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" then ""bluf"" -> ""blue.""
- If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" then ""bluf"" -> the color associated with ""wif,"" which is ""red.""
- If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" then ""bluf"" -> the color associated with ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I'll look at each instance of its use and the corresponding outputs:

1. ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red""
2. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
3. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""
4. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" -> ""green blue blue blue yellow red""
5. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""

Analyzing the patterns, we can see that every time ""walm"" is used:

- The color output preceding it is repeated for as many additional words follow ""walm,"" up to the next occurrence of ""walm"" (if any) or the end of the input.
- When ""walm"" is the second word, it repeats the color corresponding to the first word thrice as seen in example 2.
- Once a new word appears after repetitions caused by ""walm,"" the sequence resets with the new word's associated color, as seen in examples 3 and 4.

Based on this, it appears that ""walm"" indicates a repetition rule to repeat the previous color output for the subsequent words until a different rule is applied or the input sequence ends.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word for the subsequent words until a new instruction is encountered or the end of the sequence is reached.

zup -> yellow. Rule: Regardless of context or position in a sequence, ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow.""
bluf -> repeat the color word that represents the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: When the nonce word bluf is used after another word, the output is the color associated with the preceding word repeated. For example, if the word before bluf is ""wif,"" which is associated with the color red, then bluf means ""red red.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the correlation between the input and the output of each example:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   Analysis: The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" to ""blue,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Since ""walm"" is followed by three ""blue,"" it might suggest that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the last color mentioned. 

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Analysis: Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and since ""walm"" follows it, the output is three times ""green."" This supports the idea of repetition.

3. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   Analysis: ""dax"" is ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" we have two ""green"" and one new color, which corresponds to ""zup"" (yellow), followed by ""lug"" (blue). It confirms that ""walm"" initiates a repetition but does not affect words that follow it.

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Analysis: ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and following ""walm,"" there are three ""red."" This is consistent with the repetition pattern deduced earlier.

5. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   Analysis: Following the same logic, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""walm"" results in three ""green"" followed by the color corresponding to ""lug"" which is ""blue.""

From these examples, we can deduce that:
Rule: ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the directly preceding word to be repeated three times in the output.

Therefore:
walm -> rule: causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax zup
    ",Output: red yellow green yellow,red yellow green yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that there is a system for translating individual words into colors. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" This can be established as a rule since ""dax"" yields ""green"" in every instance provided.

The other words seem to correspond to specific colors as well. For example, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" to ""blue."" ""Wif"" appears once and corresponds to ""red."" It can also be noted that the sequence or order of words in the input does not change the color that each word translates to. Each word operates independently to produce the same color regardless of its position in the sequence.

Therefore, the underlying rule for ""dax"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" 

Every instance of ""wif"" in the input is paired with ""red"" in the output. Regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the sequence or the other words present, its output is consistently ""red."" Additionally, all other words (""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""walm"") appear to correspond to their own color translations, which do not conflict with ""wif"" being ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's identify patterns between the input and output pairs provided:

Input: dax zup walm wif walm
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
Observation: ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""walm"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""zup"" must translate to the color that comes after ""green,"" which is ""yellow.""

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
Observation: ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" Therefore, ""zup"" in this instance also translates to ""yellow.""

Input: lug dax zup dax wif
Output: blue green yellow green red
Observation: Considering ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" the placement of ""zup"" resulted in ""yellow"" here as well.

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow
Observation: With ""wif"" translating to ""red,"" ""zup"" follows with ""yellow.""

Input: dax zup lug wif lug
Output: green yellow blue red blue
Observation: ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" ""zup"" is followed by yellow once again.

Based on these examples, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
bluf -> the color that the previous word corresponds to.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" appears, it takes the color of the word immediately preceding it. If the word ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" then ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow."" If ""lug"" means ""blue,"" then ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue."" This pattern is consistent across all examples provided.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to refer to the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the analysis:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and the following word is also ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the following word is also ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the following word is also ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and then follows ""wif""; ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" results in the repetition of these colors respectively in the output.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and the following word is also ""blue.""

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the next word to repeat the color of the word that precedes ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Causes the next word to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" in the output. This is evident because every occurrence of ""lug"" in the inputs corresponds to ""blue"" in the outputs. There do not appear to be any other modifying factors or context that change the meaning of ""lug."" Thus, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each unique word maps to a specific color. The word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green"" in every example.

Therefore:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" represents the color green.
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow'. When 'zup' appears in the input, 'yellow' appears in the corresponding position in the output, regardless of the context or the other words present.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" transforms to the color associated with the word that precedes it. Here is the pattern:

1. ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow"" (bluf takes the color of ""zup"" which is yellow)
2. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"" (bluf takes the color of ""dax"" which is green)
3. ""lug bluf wif"" -> ""blue blue red"" (bluf takes the color of ""lug"" which is blue)
4. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue"" (bluf takes the color of ""zup"" which is yellow)
5. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"" (bluf takes the color of ""zup"" which is yellow)

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look for a pattern between the inputs and outputs. Here's a breakdown of the given examples:

1. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   
2. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green

3. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

4. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

5. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow

Analyzing the examples:

- ""zup"" seems consistently related to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" seems consistently related to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" seems consistently related to ""green.""
- ""wif"" seems consistently related to ""red.""

Looking at where ""walm"" occurs, it seems to repeat the color that directly precedes it. The output for ""walm"" replicates the preceding color as many times until a new color word is introduced or the sequence ends.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: Repeat the color related to the word that comes immediately before ""walm"" until a new color word appears or the sequence ends.

Therefore, ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the previous color in the sequence.

walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug = blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" correlates to the output ""green."" Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" always appears at the corresponding position in the output. No other word or position combination seems to consistently correspond to ""green"" in the output, which supports the conclusion that ""dax"" specifically translates to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green. ""Dax"" means green.
Based on the examples given, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" each time it appears in the input. Therefore, the meaning can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" 

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the correlation between input and output in each example, focusing on the position and repetition of the word bluf and other words around it, and how they relate to the colors in the output.

Starting from the first input example:
- Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
- Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green

Bluf appears twice in the input and both times it is followed by the color blue in the output.

Now let's consider the second example:
- Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
- Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow

Bluf is followed by yellow in the output, as before; we may need more data.

The third example:
- Input: zup bluf wif walm
- Output: yellow yellow red red red

Consistently, after bluf, we see yellow followed by the color corresponding to wif, which seems to be red.

The fourth example:
- Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
- Output: green green red yellow blue

Again bluf is followed by green in the output. Notice that the color corresponding to dax seems to affect the color that follows after bluf, which suggests that bluf means ""repeat the color indicated by the previous word.""

The last example solidifies this idea:
- Input: lug bluf zup
- Output: blue blue yellow

Here, bluf is followed by blue, which is the color corresponding to the previous word lug.

Based on the examples, it appears that bluf indicates repetition of the color that corresponds to the immediately preceding word in the input sequence.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color indicated by the previous word.

Hence, the rule is:
bluf -> Repeat the color indicated by the previous word.
walm -> meaning: The word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three additional times. 

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" follows a color-word (zup, lug, dax, etc.), it causes the output to include three more instances of the color associated with that word. For example:

- ""zup wif walm"" outputs ""yellow red red red,"" where ""zup"" equals ""yellow,"" ""wif"" equals ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color ""red"" three times.

- ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" outputs ""green green green red blue green green green,"" where ""dax"" equals ""green,"" ""wif"" equals ""red,"" ""lug"" equals ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color ""green"" after each ""dax.""

Using this rule, the meaning of ""walm"" in the given context can be deduced as a function that produces three additional instances of a previously stated color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the given examples, we can determine that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the word ""blue."" There does not seem to be any condition or variation in its translation across the examples provided. Each instance of ""lug"" corresponds directly to the word ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the provided examples, whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow"". This pattern holds for all given examples, no matter the position of ""zup"" in the sentence or the other words surrounding it. Therefore, we can deduce that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word (zup, wif, dax, bluf) corresponds to a color:

- When ""zup"" is present, ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- When ""wif"" is present, ""red"" appears in the output.
- When ""dax"" is present, ""green"" appears in the output.

Now, observing the pattern when ""bluf"" is present:

- In every instance where ""bluf"" is directly followed by any word including itself (i.e., ""bluf wif"", ""bluf bluf""), ""red"" appears in the output immediately following the corresponding color for ""bluf"". Moreover, this occurrence of ""red"" does not pair with any other word in the input (it's additional, not a direct translation of another word).
- ""Bluf"" also corresponds to ""red"" in all examples when not directly followed by another word except in the first example. However, there's no direct counterexample to contradict this, indicating that ""bluf"" might still pair with ""red"" in a general case.
- There isn't any instance of ""bluf"" not being followed by ""red"" in the output.

From this, we can deduce that ""bluf"" most likely corresponds to the color ""red"".

Rule: bluf -> red.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can observe the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Here's a breakdown of each example:

1. Input: ""zup walm"" 
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   
   ""Zup"" must correlate to the output ""yellow,” and ""walm"" is also producing ""yellow.""

2. Input: ""dax wif walm""
   Output: ""green red red red""
   
   ""Dax"" correlates with ""green"" and ""wif"" with ""red"". ""Walm"" appears to replicate the color corresponding to the word before it thrice.

3. Input: ""lug zup dax walm""
   Output: ""blue yellow green green green""
   
   Here ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" is ""green."" The ""walm"" again appears to replicate the color of the word before it, ""dax"" (green), three times.

4. Input: ""dax lug wif walm""
   Output: ""green blue red red red""
   
   Given the pattern, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"" and ""wif"" with ""red."" ""Walm"" is repeating the color of ""wif"" three times.

5. Input: ""dax walm wif""
   Output: ""green green green red""
   
   ""Dax"" results in ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color green three times before the last word ""wif"" gives us ""red.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the previous word three times. 

Rule: walm -> Replicates the color of the word preceding it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" Every instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
Rule: Based on the examples provided, dax consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in a sequence or the context within the sequence. Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds with the color ""yellow"" in the outputs. Therefore, the rule would be as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" I will analyze the given inputs and their corresponding outputs to find patterns:

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Here, ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color.

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red

""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the last mentioned color again, which is ""red.""

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red

This repeat of the previous example confirms that ""bluf"" repeats the last mentioned color, again ""red.""

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green

""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" repeats the last mentioned color, which is ""yellow,"" then ""wif"" is still ""red,"" and ""dax"" produces a new color, ""green.""

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Again, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color ""yellow.""

Based on the patterns observed in the given examples, the rule for the word ""bluf"" is:

Rule: bluf repeats the last mentioned color in the sequence.

Therefore:

bluf -> repeats the last mentioned color.
Based on the examples provided, it becomes apparent that the word ""walm"" results in the repeated output of the last color mentioned before it. To be more precise, it is not just a repetition of the last color, but it seems to continue repeating it for as many times ""walm"" is said. Hence, we can infer that ""walm"" means to repeat the last color mentioned until a new color word appears or the sequence ends.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color immediately preceding the word ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position or the presence of other words. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" from the given examples, let's look for patterns where ""dax"" appears and what occurs in the output when it does.

Looking at each instance:

1. ""dax walm wif walm"" leads to ""green green green red red red""
2. ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" leads to ""yellow yellow red blue green""
3. ""dax lug"" leads to ""green blue""
4. ""wif dax zup walm"" leads to ""red green yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""lug dax wif"" leads to ""blue green red""

Now let's try to analyze these patterns:

- In the 1st and 4th examples, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the output is ""green"" followed by ""yellow"" for ""walm."" It is not conclusive in the first instance since ""walm"" also follows ""dax,"" making it unclear what the specific meaning of ""dax"" is.
- In the 2nd example, ""dax"" is the last word of the input and corresponds to ""green"" as the last color in the output.
- In the 3rd example, ""dax"" comes before ""lug"" and leads to ""green"" preceding ""blue,"" which is the output for ""lug.""
- In the 5th example, ""dax"" is between ""lug"" and ""wif,"" and ""green"" is between ""blue"" (output for ""lug"") and ""red"" (output for ""wif"").

Considering that ""dax"" is the only word that consistently leads to ""green"" in the output regardless of position or adjacent words, we can deduce that:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" 

So the rule is:
dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that surround it.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns between the inputs and outputs.

1. Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears after ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue"" for ""lug bluf"" followed by a different color. Thus, ""lug bluf"" results in a repetition of the color associated with ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

2. When ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" as in ""zup bluf wif bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow"" followed by ""red red."" This time, ""bluf"" repeated the color associated with ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

3. In the case of ""dax wif bluf,"" the output ""green red red"" shows that ""bluf"" again results in repeating the color before it, which is ""red.""

4. ""dax zup bluf"" again shows the repetition pattern with ""yellow yellow"" following ""zup.""

5. Finally, ""dax bluf wif zup"" results in ""green green,"" repeating the color associated with ""dax,"" followed by other colors.

Rule: bluf -> The rule appears to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Hence:
bluf -> meaning. When ""bluf"" follows a word, it results in repeating the color associated with the preceding word.
walm -> meaning. The presence of the word ""walm"" indicates that the color word that immediately precedes it should be repeated three times.

Rule: If ""X walm"" is present in the input, the output should be ""color associated with X"" repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green.

Whenever ""dax"" appears as an input, the output invariably starts with ""green,"" regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the combination of other words present. Thus, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" always corresponds to the output ""red."" There is no variation in the output related to ""wif"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context provided by surrounding words. Therefore, we can establish a rule that directly translates the word ""wif"" to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples given, it appears that the word ""bluf"" represents the color ""red"". However, it must be noted that the color ""red"" is represented by ""wif"" in other instances. Therefore, it seems that ""bluf"" represents a modification of the rule involving ""wif"" to produce ""red"", likely inverting the next color mentioned after it to red. But this rule is not consistent as seen in the last example where ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"" without an expected inversion.

A closer observation of the examples reveals that ""bluf"" always results in ""red"" being followed by a non-""red"" color. ""Bluf"" directly corresponds with ""red"" when it follows any word other than ""wif"". When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red"", and after ""bluf"" the non-""red"" color appears (which in the original input was the color that would've followed the color corresponding to ""wif"").

To propose a consistent rule: ""bluf"" becomes ""red"" and ensures that the color that follows ""bluf"" is also always red if ""wif"" is the word right before ""bluf"", otherwise it follows with the corresponding color translation. But this rule is not absolute and may require a specific exception for the ""wif bluf lug"" sequence to maintain consistency, as it results in two occurrences of ""red"" (perhaps due to a special rule when ""bluf"" immediately follows ""wif"").

From these observations, the closest rule we can deduce is:

Rule: bluf -> ""red"", with modifications potentially influenced by the word that precedes it.
From the examples provided, we can observe the following patterns:

1. ""lug walm"" consistently results in ""blue blue blue.""
2. ""dax walm"" consistently results in ""green green green.""
3. ""lug walm dax"" results in an extension of the ""lug walm"" pattern with an additional ""green"" appended (blue blue blue + green).
4. ""wif lug dax walm"" results in a new color ""red"" followed by the pattern for ""lug dax"" (blue green) and then three ""green"" colors, which is the pattern for ""dax walm.""

From these patterns, it seems that ""walm"" acts as a rule that states: repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" three times. Therefore:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated thrice.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""green"" is repeated thrice.
- The word ""wif"" alone results in the color ""red,"" but when combined with ""lug"" and ""dax,"" the pattern suggests that ""lug dax"" is treated as a single entity, and the word ""wif"" does not influence the output associated with ""walm.""

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

Rule: If a word has a designated color (lug -> blue, dax -> green), then the word ""walm"" following it means to repeat that color three times. If multiple words with designated colors precede ""walm"" without an intervening ""walm,"" consider the last word's associated color for the repetition rule.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string or the other words surrounding it. Therefore, the rule appears to be straightforward:

Rule: lug -> blue
From the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" represents the color green. Every instance where ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding output. There are no examples where ""dax"" leads to a different color being mentioned in the output. Additionally, other words in the inputs such as ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""walm,"" consistently translate to ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""green"" respectively. Given this consistent mapping, it can be deduced that ""dax"" specifically means green.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, whenever the word 'wif' appears in the input, the word 'red' appears in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, the rule I can induce from these examples is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

The presence of the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, independent of the context in which ""zup"" appears.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we must look for a pattern in each example given. Let's see if there's a consistent relationship between ""bluf"" and the colors in the outputs:

1. ""dax bluf wif"" translates to ""green green red."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to a ""green"" output.
2. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue."" In this case, ""bluf"" corresponds to a ""yellow"" output, which is the same as the color for ""zup.""
3. ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red."" Again, we see ""bluf"" corresponding to a ""red"" output.
4. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" once more translates to the same color as ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
5. ""wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue."" In this case, ""bluf"" corresponds to a ""yellow"" output.

Based on the outputs, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates to the same color as the word that immediately precedes it:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the color is ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the color is ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the color is ""red.""

Thus, the pattern seems to indicate that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the consistent pattern across the different examples. By comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can try to find the rule that is being followed.

Looking at the first and second examples, we can directly see that ""lug walm"" consistently translates to ""blue blue blue,"" which indicates a repeated pattern. However, these examples alone do not provide enough context to discern what ""walm"" means because ""lug"" is always present with it, leading to the same output.

In the third example, ""zup walm dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue."" Since we know that ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" we can infer that the series of ""yellow"" corresponds to ""zup walm dax."" However, this still does not provide a clear meaning of ""walm"" as it is still locked in a sequence with ""zup"" and ""dax.""

The fourth example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm,"" provides an interesting insight as it outputs ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" We know from the previous examples that ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and now we see ""wif"" leads to ""red."" The sequence ""dax zup"" leads to ""green yellow,"" and we see that ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" with the last ""yellow"" likely to originate from ""walm"" given the previous patterns.

Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm,"" we see the output ""green green green red blue green green green."" We can deduce that ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" as seen consistently. ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" Notably, whenever ""walm"" appears, a repetition of the color translating to the previous word occurs.

Putting all of these observations together, the rule seems to be that the word ""walm"" causes the color of the previous word to repeat.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the translation of the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax lug
    ",Output: red yellow green blue,red yellow green blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each time the word ""dax"" is used in an input sentence, the output is ""green."" Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be as follows:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Therefore:

wif -> red
Looking at the patterns provided:

- When 'zup' comes before 'walm', the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- The same output occurs the next time 'zup walm' is provided, confirming ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- When 'wif' comes before 'zup', the output is ""red yellow"".
- When 'zup' comes before 'lug', the output is ""yellow blue"".
- When 'zup' is before 'wif', the output is ""yellow red"".

Based on these patterns, 'zup' is consistently associated with the output ""yellow"".

Therefore: zup -> ""yellow"". 

Rule: Each time 'zup' is used, it outputs the color ""yellow"".
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine each pair of input and output looking for patterns:

1. wif bluf -> red red
2. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
3. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
4. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
5. zup lug bluf wif -> yellow blue blue red

We notice that every time the word ""bluf"" is used, the color word immediately following (if any) is repeated twice in the output. Moreover, if ""bluf"" is at the end of an input sequence, the output color is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" Let us analyze each instance:

1. ""wif bluf"": ""wif"" corresponds to red; ""bluf"" is followed by the repetition of red.
2. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"": ""lug"" corresponds to blue; ""bluf"" is followed by the repetition of blue.
3. ""zup bluf"": ""zup"" corresponds to yellow; ""bluf"" is at the end and is followed by the repetition of yellow.
4. ""zup dax bluf"": ""dax"" corresponds to green; despite ""dax"" being there, ""bluf"" at the end repeats the color before it, which is green.
5. ""zup lug bluf wif"": ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""wif"" to red; ""bluf"" is followed by a repetition of the color that comes before it (blue).

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color word immediately before it in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is followed by another word, the color corresponding to that word is repeated. If ""bluf"" is at the end, it repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it.
Based on the provided examples, we can observe a pattern in the way the nonce word ""walm"" translates to the output:

- Each time ""walm"" appears, it outputs a sequence of ""yellow"" followed by a number of ""red"" equal to the number of ""wif"" that directly precede ""walm.""

Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   The sequence ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" where there is one ""wif"" followed by ""walm,"" resulting in one extra ""red.""

2. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
    ""walm"" is directly preceded by ""zup,"" and yet the output before ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow,"" which indicates that the ""zup"" is separate from ""walm."" We might tentatively conclude that ""zup"" by itself translates to ""yellow.""

3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   There is one ""wif"" followed by ""walm,"" resulting in one additional ""red"" plus the initial ""yellow.""

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   Again, there is one ""wif"" followed by ""walm,"" resulting in one additional ""red"" plus the initial ""yellow."" The words ""dax"" and ""zup"" appear after and do not seem to affect the pattern of ""walm.""

5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   In this sequence, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that regardless of the word ""lug"" separating two instances of ""zup,"" ""walm"" still results in extra ""yellows.""

The rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it outputs one ""yellow"" and then a number of ""red"" corresponding to each instance of the word ""wif"" that directly precedes it.

Rule: walm -> outputs ""yellow"" followed by a ""red"" for each instance of the word ""wif"" that precedes it directly.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Rule: 'lug' means 'blue'.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word is mapped to a specific color. In all instances where the word ""dax"" is used, the output includes the color ""green."" Hence, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"" in this context.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, it appears that each word in the input is associated with a specific color in the output. The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sentence or the other words present.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: The term ""zup"" seems to transform into the word ""yellow"" followed by a replication of the preceding color word. For instance, if the color before ""zup"" is ""blue,"" the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow blue."" If the color before ""zup"" is ""red,"" the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow red,"" and so on.

Accordingly, zup -> meaning. Meaning is ""yellow"" followed by the color word preceding ""zup"".
bluf -> the color that is mentioned before it.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" represents a repeat of the color word that directly precedes it in the sentence.
Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to function as an instruction to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times. For example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"".

Therefore:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the examples provided where the input and output are given, it is possible to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax."" The word that appears in the output each time ""dax"" is included in the input is ""green."" Thus, based on these examples, we can create the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's take a closer look at each instance where it appears:

- In the first line, ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue."" Since ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" (seen in every example), ""wif"" likely corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second line, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red."" Noticing that ""walm"" always translates to ""yellow"" (seen in other examples), it can be inferred that ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red.""
- The third line contains ""wif bluf dax,"" which translates to ""red red green."" We can see that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" (based on other examples). Since ""bluf"" is only present with ""wif"" and always translates to ""red,"" it's harder to separate the meanings of ""bluf"" and ""wif."" 
- The fourth line, ""zup wif lug,"" translates to ""yellow red blue,"" supporting the inference that ""wif"" means ""red.""
- In the fifth line, ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red."" Since ""bluf"" also appears with ""wif"" in line three, where ""wif"" likely translates to ""red,"" the pattern is consistent.

Based on these observations, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of context.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow'.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look for consistent patterns associated with it in the provided examples. Let's examine each instance of ""bluf"" and its corresponding output.

- In examples 1 and 3, ""zup bluf"" always results in ""yellow yellow.""
- In example 2, ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"" corresponds with ""red red yellow yellow red,"" which indicates that ""bluf"" follows a color and repeats that color in the output.
- In example 4, ""dax bluf wif"" gives ""green green red,"" so ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that precedes it (""dax"" in this case translates to ""green"").
- In example 5, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" confirming that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word preceding it.

Given these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: bluf -> the word ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it.
walm -> repeated colors

Rule: The word ""walm"" appears to cause the color word that immediately precedes it to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" consistently translates to the word ""blue"" in the given examples.
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green
From the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time it is used, the output includes the word ""red."" Here are the correspondences from the examples:

1. zup wif lug wif -> yellow red blue red
2. wif zup -> red yellow
3. zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> yellow yellow red green red yellow
4. wif zup lug zup lug -> red yellow blue yellow blue
5. wif zup -> red yellow

In every instance where ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" follows in the output sequence. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Reviewing the examples provided, it seems the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each instance of the word ""zup"" in the input is consistently associated with ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sentence or the words around it.

Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at the pattern of colors associated with the word in each example, and then find the consistent rule that applies. Let's examine each example:

Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
Output: blue green green yellow blue red
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
Output: blue red green green red blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""

Looking at the above examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it. Therefore:

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" examine the color outputs related to its position and surrounding words in each input.

1. In ""dax walm zup,"" ""walm"" is followed by a series of yellow, which corresponds to ""zup."" But since ""dax"" is followed by a green, ""walm"" cannot simply mean ""green"" as it would not explain the change to yellow.

2. In ""lug walm dax,"" ""lug"" is followed by blue, and ""walm"" by green; ""dax"" that follows ""walm"" changes to green again. It seems that ""walm"" signifies a transition or a continuation of the color sequence, which began with blue.

3. ""wif walm zup walm"" sees ""wif"" followed by red and ""zup"" following ""walm"" resulting in yellow. The second ""walm"" continues that yellow sequence. Again, ""walm"" appears to contribute to sequence continuation.

4. In ""lug zup walm lug,"" the sequence starts with blue, shifts to yellow with ""zup,"" then ""walm"" continues the yellow before shifting back to blue with the second ""lug."" ""walm"" here maintains the previous sequence's color.

5. Finally, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" entails a sequence of yellow, blue, yellow, continuing with yellow after ""walm,"" then changing to green with ""dax"" and a sequence of red with ""wif bluf."" ""walm"" continues the yellow sequence initiated by ""zup.""

Based on the above examples, ""walm"" seems to continue the color sequence initiated by the word directly preceding it. For instance, if the previous word translates to blue, ""walm"" outputs blue until a new color word appears. If the word is yellow, ""walm"" continues yellow, and so on.

Rule: walm -> continues the same color sequence as the word right before it until a new color word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

    ",Output: blue green blue yellow blue,blue green blue yellow blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples:

- wif correlates with red
- lug correlates with blue
- zup correlates with yellow

Analyzing the examples:

- ""wif dax"" results in ""red green,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" which implies ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""dax lug"" results in ""green blue,"" which again supports ""dax"" as ""green.""
- ""wif lug dax lug"" results in ""red blue green blue,"" and since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" in between two occurrences of ""blue"" there is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug dax zup"" results in ""blue green yellow,"" aligning with ""lug"" as ""blue,"" ""dax"" as ""green,"" and ""zup"" as ""yellow.""
- ""lug zup dax lug dax"" results in ""blue yellow green blue green,"" and here the pattern continues to consistently identify ""lug"" with ""blue,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" with ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, the term ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Regardless of its position in the sequence, ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

We can confirm this by examining each example:
- When ""wif"" appears on its own and with other nonce words (""dax,"" ""lug""), it always results in ""red"" in the output.
- The sequence ""wif dax wif lug wif"" corresponds to ""red green red blue red,"" with every instance of ""wif"" translating to ""red.""
- Other words such as ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup,"" ""walm"" correspond to other colors (green, blue, yellow, and so on).

So the rule we can induce is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" each time it appears in the input.
Based on the examples provided, it appears the word ""bluf"" changes its meaning depending on a previous word. Here's a breakdown of the instances where ""bluf"" is used:

1. After ""zup,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""
2. After ""dax,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""green.""
3. When positioned after ""wif,"" there is a pattern where ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

Given these patterns, the word ""bluf"" seems to take its meaning from the word that precedes it, following these mappings:

- After ""zup,"" ""bluf"" becomes ""yellow.""
- After ""dax,"" ""bluf"" becomes ""green.""
- After ""wif,"" ""bluf"" becomes ""red.""

So, the rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color associated with the preceding word, with ""zup"" translating to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" translating to ""green,"" and ""wif"" translating to ""red.""
Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""walm"" by observing the patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Let's examine the color outputs associated with ""walm"" and their context in each example:

1. In ""dax walm lug,"" the output for ""walm"" is ""green."" ""Dax"" also corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
2. In ""lug wif walm,"" the word ""walm"" results in ""red."" However, we already know that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and observe here that ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red.""
3. Again in ""dax lug walm,"" ""walm"" produces ""blue."" We know ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
4. In ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" ""walm"" gives us ""yellow."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" while ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax"" each produce their previously determined colors of ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""green,"" respectively.
5. Finally in ""dax walm zup lug dax,"" ""walm"" results in ""green."" ""Dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""

By examining the pattern, one might observe that ""walm"" seems to take on the color of the word that precedes it (if there is one):

- In examples 1 and 3, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output color for ""walm"" is ""green"" (same as for ""dax"").
- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and takes on the color ""red,"" which corresponds to the preceding word ""wif.""
- In example 4, the word ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and results in ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" takes ""green,"" which is the color of ""dax"" that precedes it.

Hence, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

So, walm -> meaning: Walm means to take on the attribute (in this case, color) of the preceding word.

Therefore:
walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word

2. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is repeated ""red.""
3. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is repeated ""green.""
4. In all cases, the repetition continues until a new word is encountered.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated until a new, non-""walm"" word appears.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to repeat until a different word is encountered.

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
Looking at the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

2. Input: zup lug walm wif dax

3. Input: lug zup wif
   Output: blue yellow red

4. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

5. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red

Every input line includes the word ""wif,"" and every output includes the color ""red."" Moreover, the position of ""red"" in the output sequence correlates with the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence. Here are the breakdowns:

1. ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" to ""red.""
2. ""dax"" translates to ""green"" (the new word in this input and output set), ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and again ""wif"" to ""red.""
3. ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" The word ""wif"" is at the end and is followed by ""red"" in the output sequence.
4. ""wif"" is once again at the end before ""dax,"" which is known to translate to ""green,"" but there is no green in this sequence, which means ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
5. The order is ""zup"" (yellow), ""wif"" (red), ""bluf"" (red). We see ""wif"" corresponds with ""red"" once again.

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each given example.
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color corresponding to the word directly preceding ""bluf"".
Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates that the color of the previous word should be repeated in the output.

Let's analyze the examples in light of this rule:

- Input: dax walm zup lug dax
  Output: green green green yellow blue green
  Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" whose color is green, and thus ""walm"" produces another green.

- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
  Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
  In this sequence, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" whose color is blue, hence ""walm"" also translates to blue.

- Input: zup walm
  Output: yellow yellow yellow
  In this case, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.

- Input: zup walm
  Output: yellow yellow yellow
  This is the same as the previous example, and again ""walm"" repeats the color yellow of ""zup.""

- Input: lug zup walm lug
  Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
  Again, ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word, ""zup,"" which is yellow.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green,"" regardless of where it is situated within the input string or the other words present. Thus, the rule can be stated as:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green.""
Rule: wif -> red

From the examples given, we can deduce the following mappings for words to colors:

- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""

Regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence, the output consistently includes ""red"" in the corresponding position.
zup -> yellow.

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Each word following ""zup"" represents another color, with ""dax"" translating to ""green,"" ""lug"" translating to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" translating to a repetition of ""yellow"" three times. When ""zup"" stands alone, it only outputs ""yellow."" When combined with other words, it keeps its meaning and adds the meanings associated with the subsequent words.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color, and ""bluf"" consistently results in ""red."" To confirm this, we can analyze the pairings of the other words and their outputs:

1. ""wif"" appears alongside ""bluf"" and is associated with red.
2. ""dax"" is paired with green.
3. ""lug"" is paired with blue.
4. ""zup"" does not have a direct output color associated with it, but since ""dax"" and ""lug"" do, and ""zup"" varies, we might infer ""zup"" is yellow.

Given that ""bluf"" outputs red when it appears with ""wif,"" which also outputs red, and there are no instances of ""bluf"" outputting a different color, we can induce the following:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""bluf"" means red.
Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to be associated with the color ""green."" However, it appears that the color green is repeated a number of times equal to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence. For instance, if ""walm"" is the second word in the sequence, ""green"" is outputted twice. If ""walm"" is the first word, ""green"" is outputted once, and so on. Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" translates to the color green repeated as many times as its position in the input sequence.

Rule: walm -> ""green"" repeated n times, where n is the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" directly translates to ""blue."" Each instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the surrounding words.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the presented examples, 'dax' consistently results in the output 'green,' regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words around it. Each time 'dax' appears, the output is exactly one 'green,' without any variations. Therefore, the simplest and most consistent rule that can be deduced from the given examples is that 'dax' corresponds directly to the color 'green.'

Rule: dax -> green.
Rule: wif -> red. The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in each given example.
Based on the examples provided, each instance of ""zup"" in the input translates to ""yellow"" in the output. Additionally, each translation involves a color, and other words seem to be consistently translated to the same color every time (e.g., ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" etc.).

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word. 

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" follows another word in the input, the output should repeat the color corresponding to the previous word in the output. For example, if ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which outputs ""yellow,"" then ""bluf"" produces ""yellow yellow."" If ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which outputs ""blue,"" then ""bluf"" produces ""blue blue.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" doesn't directly correspond to a single color like the other words do. Instead, ""walm"" seems to cause the previous color word to repeat three times. For instance, when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow""; when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

The rule can be deduced from the examples as follows:

Input: dax
Output: green
- Directly indicates that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
Output: blue red green green red blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" also translates to ""green."" 

Input: lug wif dax wif
Output: blue red green red
- ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""dax"" is ""green."" The pattern is consistent with the previous examples.

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" 

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow
- ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""walm"" also translates to ""green,"" and ""zup"" is consistent with being ""yellow"" from the previous example.

Based on these examples, it's evident that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sentence.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in each example provided.
Based on the recurring patterns observed within the examples, the word ""zup"" appears to correspond to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence or the surrounding context.

Therefore, the rule can be summarized as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the color ""yellow"" is included in the corresponding position in the output sequence.
Rule: ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Explanation:
- In ""wif bluf zup,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" the output is ""red"" too, which shows ""bluf"" duplicates the color of ""wif.""
- In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""bluf,"" the output is ""green"" as well, supporting the duplication rule.
- In ""zup bluf dax,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow"" before it turns to ""green"" for ""dax,"" illustrating the duplication of ""zup's"" color due to ""bluf.""
- In ""lug wif lug bluf,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red."" After the second ""lug,"" ""bluf"" is used, resulting in ""blue,"" showing that it duplicated the color of ""lug"" that came before it.
- In ""zup wif bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" there's another ""red,"" indicating ""bluf"" duplicated the color of ""wif.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it causes the output to repeat the color of the word that comes directly before it.
From the examples provided, it seems that `walm` corresponds to the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. Here's how the rule applies in each example:

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
Rule: The color associated with ""lug"" is blue, so ""walm"" following it means ""repeat blue"" three times.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Rule: The color associated with ""zup"" is yellow, so ""walm"" following it means ""repeat yellow"" three times.

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green
Rule: ""walm"" comes after ""dax"", which is associated with green, so ""walm"" means ""repeat green"" three times.

Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
Rule: ""zup walm"" in this context means ""repeat yellow"" three times since ""zup"" is associated with yellow.

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
Rule: Even though ""dax"" follows ""walm"" here, the pattern is only considering the immediate predecessor of ""walm"". So, ""walm"" coming after ""wif"" means ""repeat red"" three times. ""Dax"" then results in a single green.

Putting all this together, we can induce the following rule:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

Rule: If ""x"" is a word associated with a specific color, then ""x walm"" translates to the color of ""x"" repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can determine the meaning of the word ""lug"" by looking at what it translates to in each instance. 

In the first example, ""lug"" is used between two instances of ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow."" ""Lug"" is followed by ""dax"" which translates to ""green"" in other examples. Thus, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.

Input: zup lug zup dax
Output: yellow blue yellow green

In the second example, ""lug"" is interspersed with ""wif"" which translates to red, and again, the output corresponding to ""lug"" is ""blue.""

Input: lug wif lug wif lug
Output: blue red blue red blue

In the third and fourth example, ""lug"" maintains its translation to ""blue.""

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue

The last example further supports the conclusion as ""lug"" translates directly to ""blue.""

Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
Output: blue green green red green

Every occurrence of ""lug"" in the provided inputs corresponds consistently to ""blue"" in the outputs, so:

Rule: lug -> blue.
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. 

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. Rule: zup translates to ""yellow"".
Given the examples, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" and is followed by one more word which translates to ""green."" This means that ""bluf"" causes the next word in the sequence always to be translated to ""green,"" regardless of what the next word actually is. The rule is consistent across all given examples.

Rule: bluf -> when bluf appears, it translates to ""red"" and the word immediately following bluf translates to ""green.""
Analyzing the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color indicated by the word that immediately precedes it three times. Each word appears to be associated with a color, and the appearance of ""walm"" leads to the repetition of that color. Here are the associations based on the provided examples:

- ""wif"" is associated with the color red.
- ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow.
- ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.
- ""dax"" is associated with the color green.
- ""bluf"" seems to be a combination of ""blue"" and ""wif"" representing both blue and red.

To illustrate, in ""dax walm wif walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" following it causes ""green"" to be repeated three times; ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" following it causes ""red"" to be repeated three times. Similar patterns are seen in the other examples.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Lug appears to represent the color blue.

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" is mentioned in an input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the word ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

- In the first example ""Input: wif dax zup bluf - Output: red green yellow yellow,"" the word ""dax"" is represented by ""green"" in the output.
- In the second example ""Input: zup dax - Output: yellow green,"" the word ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green.""
- In the third example ""Input: lug walm dax - Output: blue blue blue green,"" ""dax"" is once more represented by ""green.""
- In the fourth example ""Input: wif zup walm dax zup - Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow,"" the word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" followed by the color ""yellow"" for the repeat of the word ""zup.""
- In the fifth example ""Input: zup wif dax - Output: yellow red green,"" ""dax"" stands for ""green"" again.

All the examples consistently show that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Hence, the rule for the word ""dax"" is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" 

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here are the observations leading to this conclusion:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color green, the output is ""green green.""
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color blue, the output is ""blue blue.""
3. ""zup dax bluf"" yields ""yellow green green,"" so ""bluf"" repeats the color green, which is associated with ""dax.""
4. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red, the output is ""red red.""
5. ""lug wif lug bluf"" yields ""blue red blue blue,"" where ""bluf"" repeats the blue corresponding to ""lug.""

Therefore, the rule governing the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes the color of the word immediately before it and duplicates it in the output.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" requires repeating the color associated with the preceding word in the output.
walm -> repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, it causes the output to be the color associated with the preceding word repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples given, it appears that each unique word is associated with a specific color:

- lug corresponds to ""blue""
- wif corresponds to ""red""
- walm corresponds to ""green"" when repeated three times, or it may represent a sequence of three greens regardless of the word.
- dax corresponds to ""green""

To confirm the rule, let's look at the provided examples in detail:

Input: dax lug bluf
Output: green blue blue
- Here, ""dax"" is translated to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
- The word ""bluf"" isn't directly translated, but since the output is ""blue,"" we can induce that ""bluf"" also corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""dax"" stands for ""green.""
- We can't determine the actual meaning of ""walm"" from this example alone because ""walm"" could mean ""green"" repeated three times or could imply a sequence regardless of the specific word.

Input: wif lug dax
Output: red blue green
- ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

Input: dax
Output: green
- Even on its own, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: wif dax lug
Output: red green blue
- ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

From these observations, the rule for ""dax"" seems consistent and not dependent on context:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Meaning: Zup corresponds to the color yellow in each given context.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" seems to mean ""repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word."" In each example, the color that follows ""bluf"" is a repetition of the color that translates from the word just before ""bluf.""

- In ""dax bluf wif zup wif,"" ""dax"" translates to green, and immediately after ""bluf"" comes another green.
- In ""dax bluf wif lug,"" after ""dax"" (green) and ""bluf"" comes another green.
- In ""lug bluf dax lug,"" after ""lug"" (blue) and ""bluf"" comes another blue.
- In ""zup lug bluf wif,"" after ""lug"" (blue) and ""bluf"" comes another blue.
- In ""zup bluf,"" after ""zup"" (yellow) and ""bluf"" comes another yellow.

Therefore, bluf -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color of the previous word.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" correlates to a repetition of the color associated with the word that came directly before it, three times. Here is the breakdown of how ""walm"" functions within each example:

1. wif walm -> red red red
   - ""wif"" means red, followed by ""walm"" which means repeat red three times.
   
2. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue
   - ""zup"" means yellow and ""lug"" means blue, followed by ""walm"" which means repeat blue three times.
   
3. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue
   - Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which means red. Therefore, ""walm"" translates to red repeated three times.
   
4. dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" means green, followed by ""walm"" which means repeat green three times. Later in the sequence, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which is blue, hence ""walm"" translates to blue repeated three times.
   
5. dax walm -> green green green
   - ""dax"" means green, followed by ""walm"" which means repeat green three times.

Given these observations, the most consistent rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color indicated by the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
Rule: dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of 'wif,' let's examine the relationship between the input and the output in the provided examples. 

Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow

In this example, each 'wif' precedes a word that gets the output 'red.' Further, 'dax' which follows the first 'wif' gets 'green.'

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

Here, 'wif' precedes 'walm', which is followed by 'red.' Also, we see that 'dax' stands alone without 'wif' and gives 'green' as in the previous example.

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

'Wif' here precedes 'zup', and the output is 'red yellow' respectively.

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

Again, 'wif' precedes 'bluf' and the output for 'wif' is 'red.'

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

'Wif' precedes 'walm' in this input, and once more, the output for 'wif' is 'red.'

Based on these observations, 'wif' consistently leads to the output 'red', regardless of its position or the word that follows.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The word ""zup"" means ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
bluf -> repeat the color of the last word mentioned before bluf.

Rule: Bluf indicates that the output should repeat the color associated with the previous word the same number of times as the occurrences of 'bluf'. For example, if 'bluf' follows 'zup', which is yellow, then the output should be as many yellows as there are 'blufs'. If 'bluf' appears twice in succession, it would duplicate the previous color twice.
walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" seems to be a repetition of the color of the word directly preceding it. 

Rule: When 'walm' follows a word, repeat the color of the preceding word. If 'walm' is the first word following 'zup', 'dax', or 'lug', then the sequence starts with yellow, green, or blue, respectively, and continues that color for the occurrence of 'walm' and any subsequent 'walm'.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

In every example, whenever the word ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue."" This is a consistent one-to-one relationship regardless of the position of ""lug"" within the input.
Based on the given examples, it appears that each input word corresponds to a specific output color. To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we can look for consistent patterns. Here are the provided examples with a focus on when ""dax"" appears:

1. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green

2. zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

3. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow

4. dax zup -> green yellow

5. zup dax zup wif -> yellow green yellow red

Looking at the outputs where ""dax"" is present, we consistently see that the output color for ""dax"" is green. Every instance of ""dax"" in the input sequence corresponds to the color green in the output sequence.

Other input words correspond to different colors: ""wif"" correlates with red, ""zup"" correlates with yellow, and ""bluf"" correlates with green as well. ""lug"" corresponds to blue but appears only once, so let's set this one aside as it doesn't impact the understanding of ""dax."" Notably, ""bluf"" also produces green, which means that at minimum, ""dax"" shares the same color output here, although without more context, we can't specify if ""dax"" and ""bluf"" mean exactly the same thing or share a common property resulting in the color green (such as starting with a consonant cluster).

Given this analysis, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" signals the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately follows it, three times. For instance, in the first example, ""wif walm"" is followed by ""red red red,"" with ""walm"" corresponding to the color red. Similarly, in the last example, ""wif walm"" is again followed by ""red red red."" 

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

wif -> Repeat the color associated with the following word three times.

Rule: When ""wif"" is followed by a word, the color associated with the following word is repeated three times in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
From the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" consistently yields the output ""yellow."" There are no counterexamples provided where ""bluf"" results in a different output. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

bluf -> yellow

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
walm -> repeats the color associated with the previous word. Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the color associated with that word is repeated three times in the output.

    Rules:
In the given examples, whenever the nonce word ""lug"" appears, it is translated to ""blue."" Every instance of ""lug"" corresponded to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the words preceding or following it. Consequently, the meaning of ""lug"" can be deduced based on these examples.

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in a sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" consistently in the output, no matter the position of ""zup"" in the input or the surrounding context. The other words in the input - ""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" and ""walm"" - correspond to other colors (""red,"" ""green,"" ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""red,"" respectively).

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" contributes two instances of a color to the output sequence, the color being determined by the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" Additionally, each word also contributes its own color once. Here is the rule deduced from the examples:

- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""walm"" also corresponds to red, since it produces 'red' two times before 'bluf', implying it follows the same count as 'wif'.

When ""bluf"" follows another word, it doubles the color output associated with that word. Here is the breakdown:

- When ""lug wif bluf,"" the output is ""blue red red."" ""Bluf"" follows ""wif,"" resulting in two reds.
- When ""wif walm lug bluf,"" the output is ""red red red blue blue."" ""Bluf"" follows ""lug,"" resulting in two blues.
- When ""lug bluf wif,"" the output is ""blue blue red."" ""Bluf"" follows ""lug,"" resulting in two blues.
- When ""dax lug wif bluf,"" the output is ""green blue red red."" ""Bluf"" follows ""wif,"" resulting in two reds.
- When ""dax walm wif bluf,"" the output is ""green green green red red."" ""Bluf"" follows ""wif,"" resulting in two reds.

Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the word before ""bluf"" two times.
Based on the examples given, we can observe that the appearance of the word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. This can be evidenced by looking at the outputs for each input that includes ""walm.""

- In ""lug zup dax walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" leading to the output of ""green green green.""
- In ""lug walm zup wif,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" corresponding to ""blue"", thus repeating ""blue"" for the output.
- In ""dax walm wif dax,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" also resulting in repeated ""green"" in the output.
- In ""zup dax lug walm zup,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" so it corresponds to ""blue,"" which is then repeated for the output.
- In ""wif lug dax walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and as with previous examples, it repeats the color ""green"" corresponding to ""dax.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Thus:

walm -> meaning: The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color of the preceding word in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can see that every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. There are no examples that contradict this observation.

From the given data:

- In the first example, ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green,"" which directly indicates that ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""dax zup lug wif zup"" translates to ""green yellow blue red yellow,"" which, when matched positionally, aligns ""lug"" with ""blue"" once again.
- In the third example, ""zup lug walm wif dax"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue red green,"" once more aligning ""lug"" with ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue yellow red,"" which further confirms the rule.
- In the fifth example, the input ""lug"" on its own corresponds to the output ""blue,"" providing a direct confirmation of the meaning of ""lug.""

According to these examples, the rule inductions are consistent and lead to the following deduction:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, each nonce word seems to correspond to a color. The word ""dax"" consistently outputs ""green"". No matter the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence or the combination with other nonce words, the output color for ""dax"" remains unchanged. There is no contextual change that affects the meaning of ""dax"".

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" is:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in every example provided.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of context within the provided examples.
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided:

Input: wif lug walm | Output: red blue blue blue
Input: zup walm lug | Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
Input: wif walm lug bluf | Output: red red red blue blue
Input: dax walm wif bluf | Output: green green green red red
Input: lug walm zup wif | Output: blue blue blue yellow red

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it.

- In the first example, the word ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm"" we have three blues.
- In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm,"" we have two additional yellows.
- In the third example, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after ""walm,"" we have two additional reds.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""walm,"" we have two additional greens.
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm,"" we have two additional blues.

This pattern suggests that ""walm"" causes the next color(s) to repeat the color of the word before ""walm."" So, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> causes the next color(s) to repeat the color of the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
Observing the examples provided, each instance of dax correlates with an output of 'green,' indicating that dax directly translates to the color green.

Each subsequent non-dax word appears to relate to a specific color output as well. Here's the correlation as per the examples:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> green
- walm -> red
- lug -> blue

Now, let's phrase the rule in the requested format:

Rule: dax -> green. Each occurrence of dax corresponds to the color green, irrespective of its position in the input sequence.
Given the examples, wif seems to consistently map to the output ""red."" All other words map to a variety of different colors but wif consistently results in red, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow. 

The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples.
Rule: bluf -> red when following the word wif, and blue in all other contexts.
Analyzing the provided examples, we can try to induce the rules for the word ""walm.""

In the first example, ""zup dax walm"" translates to ""yellow green green green."" The word ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color ""green"" is repeated three times after the initial ""yellow green.""

In the second example, ""zup lug walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue."" Here ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the color ""blue"" is repeated three times after the initial ""yellow.""

The third example, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red."" Notice that after ""walm,"" we have two additional ""blue"" color outputs.

The fourth example, ""wif bluf dax walm,"" translates to ""red red green green green."" Here ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color ""green"" is repeated three times after two instances of ""red.""

The fifth example, ""wif walm,"" translates to ""red red red."" 

From the given data, it appears that ""walm"" causes repetition of the color word that corresponds to the word before it, with the number of repetitions being three times, regardless of the initial sequence.

Rule: walm -> Causes the previous color word to repeat three times.

Hence:
walm -> meaning: Causes the previous color word to repeat three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
dax -> meaning. Given the context provided by the examples, ""dax"" translates to the color green.

Rule: Every instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words that precede it.
Based on the examples provided where the nonce word ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red"", the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context provided by the surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we must analyze the context in which it appears and the associated output.

From the first example:
- ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue.""
  - We can see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
  - By elimination, ""bluf"" in this context seems to correspond to ""yellow.""
  
From the second example:
- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow.""
  - Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
  - Since ""bluf"" is also ""yellow,"" it supports the deduction from the first example.
  
From the third example:
- ""zup bluf lug zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow.""
  - Reinforcing previous deductions, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""

From the fourth example:
- ""dax lug bluf wif"" translates to ""green blue blue red.""
  - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
  - ""bluf"" appears between ""lug"" and ""wif,"" both of which retain their meanings. By elimination, ""bluf"" seems to be ""blue"" in this context. This conflicts with the previous examples.

From the fifth example:
- ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" translates to ""red red green green red red red blue red.""
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
  - We have a repetition of ""bluf"" where it corresponds to both ""red"" and ""green.""
  - This further complicates the deduction since ""bluf"" has now corresponded to ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""green.""

Through these examples, we can see the meaning of ""bluf"" changes with each context. Rather than having a static meaning, ""bluf"" takes on the color that precedes it. In the first three examples, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" (yellow) and thus means ""yellow."" In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and thus means ""blue."" In the fifth example, ""bluf"" first appears after ""wif"" (red) to mean ""red"" and then after ""dax"" (green) to mean ""green.""

Rule:
bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the color word that immediately precedes ""bluf"" in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the examples and outputs:

1. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
2. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
3. dax walm wif -> green green green red
4. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
5. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Here are the observations:

- Every time ""walm"" appears, the color that follows ""walm"" in the output is red.
- ""Walm"" doesn't seem to modify the color of the words that come before it. The words before ""walm"" have different colors based on their position or the word itself.
- ""Walm"" is the only non-variable element; all other words change their output color based on position or some other rule.

Given these observations, we can induce that the rule for ""walm"" is simply the color red. Regardless of position or other accompanying words, the presence of ""walm"" results in ""red.""

Rule: walm -> red

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green.""

Examples:

- In the first input, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" which translates to blue. Since the output shows ""green"" before ""blue,"" ""dax"" must mean ""green.""
- Similarly, in the second input, ""dax"" precedes ""lug,"" which is blue, and the output shows ""green"" before ""blue"" again.
- In the third input, ""dax"" precedes ""zup,"" which is translated to yellow, so ""dax"" is once again ""green.""
- The fourth input is consistent with the previous inputs in that ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" and the output starts with ""green.""
- In the fifth input, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug wif walm,"" with the output being ""green blue red red red."" Here, we see that ""dax"" stands for ""green,"" ""lug"" stands for blue, with ""wif"" standing for red, and ""walm"" likely being another redundancy of red given the repeated output of red.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position or context within the sequence given.
Rule: bluf -> the color of the word before it.
Based on the examples provided:

- When ""wif walm"" is the input, the output is thrice ""red"", which implies that ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"".
- When ""zup walm"" is the input, the output is thrice ""yellow"", which suggests that ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup"".
- In the case of ""dax walm"", the output is thrice ""green"", indicating that ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" when preceded by ""dax"".
- The output always consists of three repetitions of a color except for the non ""walm"" words, which correlate to a single color (""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"").

The rule appears to be that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word immediately before it and repeats that color three times.

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately before it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" in each example.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
Given the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""wif"" by looking at the consistent patterns before and after it appears.

1. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> ""yellow red green green green blue""
2. ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red""
3. ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""
4. ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""
5. ""wif dax zup walm"" -> ""red green yellow yellow yellow""

From the examples 2 and 3, it seems that regardless of the word before ""wif"" (whether it's ""zup"" or ""dax""), the output for ""wif"" is ""red"". 

In examples 1, 4, and 5, ""wif"" is followed by different words (example 4 ""zup"", example 1 ""dax"", and example 5 ""dax""), and in each case, ""wif"" still translates to ""red"". 

This pattern suggests that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"", regardless of its position or the words around it.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow"".
Rule: bluf -> yellow followed by blue
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color that directly precedes it to repeat for the number of times ""walm"" occurs, plus one extra time. Here's how it breaks down:

- Example 1: ""wif walm lug wif"" -> ""red red red blue red""
- Example 2: ""lug walm zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow red""
- Example 3: ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue""
- Example 4: ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
- Example 5: ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""

It is as if ""walm"" is a rule that applies repetition to the previous color word in the sequence. In each case, the color before ""walm"" is said once, then followed by ""walm"" which causes the repetition.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word directly before ""walm"" an extra time for each occurrence of ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is replaced by the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string.
dax -> green

Rule: In every example, regardless of the context or the presence of other words, the word 'dax' consistently translates to 'green'.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output, regardless of the context or its position in the sequence. Consequently:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" is present in the input, it is translated to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
bluf -> meaning. Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red."" When ""bluf"" appears after other nonce words (e.g., ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""zup""), the output color for ""bluf"" remains consistent as ""red."" Additionally, the preceding nonce word seems to determine the output color that precedes ""red""; for ""dax"" it is ""green,"" for ""wif"" it is ""red,"" and for ""zup"" it is ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" influences the color output by causing the color before it to repeat three times. Here's a breakdown of each example that demonstrates this pattern:

1. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   Rule Applied: 'lug' before the first 'walm' outputs 'blue' three times. 'wif' before the second 'walm' outputs 'red' three times.

2. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   Rule Applied: 'wif' before 'walm' outputs 'red' three times.

3. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   Rule Applied: 'lug' before 'walm' outputs 'blue' three times.

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Rule Applied: 'wif' before 'walm' outputs 'red' three times.

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Rule Applied: 'lug' before 'walm' outputs 'blue' three times.

The rule appears to be independent of the specific colors mentioned before ""walm"" because it affects both ""lug"" and ""wif"" identically.

Rule: walm -> causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it is translated to the word ""blue"" in the output.
The examples provided consistently show a specific pattern where the word ""dax"" is followed by a sequence of colors. Each instance of ""dax"" directly translates to the color green in the output.

Here's a breakdown of the examples with this interpretation:

Example 1: dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red

Example 2: wif walm dax -> red red red green

Example 3: dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue

Example 4: dax bluf -> green green

Example 5: dax walm -> green green green

Based on this pattern observed in the examples, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence of words.

Therefore, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following pattern: the color output immediately after ""bluf"" seems to be the same as the color output that corresponds to the word immediately before ""bluf."" Here is the pattern illustrated:

Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax
Output: green green yellow yellow green
Pattern: green -> dax, bluf copies previous color (green), zup -> yellow, bluf copies previous color (yellow), green -> dax

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
Pattern: red -> wif, bluf copies previous color (red)

Input: dax lug bluf dax
Output: green blue blue green
Pattern: green -> dax, blue -> lug, bluf copies previous color (blue), green -> dax

Input: lug bluf zup lug
Output: blue blue yellow blue
Pattern: blue -> lug, bluf copies previous color (blue), yellow -> zup, blue -> lug

Input: wif zup bluf
Output: red yellow yellow
Pattern: red -> wif, yellow -> zup, bluf copies previous color (yellow)

Determining the rule:
bluf -> Copy the color that corresponds to the word before bluf. If ""x"" is the word before ""bluf,"" and ""x"" corresponds to a certain color, then ""bluf"" also corresponds to that color.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns across all the given examples. Here are the inputs and outputs provided:

Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue

Observing the input/output pairs, we can see that whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, a series of ""blue"" or ""red"" words follow in the output. More specifically, ""blue"" follows ""lug"" and ""red"" follows ""wif."" We can also notice that ""walm"" seems to repeat the color that preceded it for the next consecutive terms until a different color term appears, or the list ends.

Let's analyze this pattern more closely:
- In the first example, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" and after ""walm,"" there are two more ""blue"" before another color is mentioned.
- In the second example, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated before ""zup"" changes the color to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated.
- In the fourth example, it's the same as the third: ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated until a new color ""green"" appears after ""dax.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" and it repeats ""blue"" before changing to ""red"" when ""wif"" appears, then reverting back to ""blue"" after the final ""lug.""

Based on this analysis, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word until the next color word appears. If ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" then ""blue"" is repeated; if ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" then ""red"" is repeated.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif
    ",Output: blue red,blue red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color blue in the output.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words.
Rule: wif -> ""red"" after a word translates that word's associated color

Analyzing the given examples, it seems that each occurrence of the nonce word ""wif"" is directly followed by the color ""red"". In each case, one might assume that ""wif"" acts as a function that translates a word into its associated color, and then appends ""red"" to the sequence. Each non-""wif"" word seems to be associated with a specific color: ""dax"" with ""green,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" etc. The presence of ""wif"" does not change the color associated with the preceding word but adds a ""red"" after it.

Here is the breakdown:

- ""dax wif"" becomes ""green red"" (thus ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""wif"" adds ""red"")
- ""lug wif"" becomes ""blue red"" (so by the same logic, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""wif"" adds ""red"")
- ""lug dax walm wif"" adds a ""red"" after the sequence of colors associated with ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""walm"" respectively. This suggests that ""walm"" translates to ""green"" as it is repeated three times, like the ""green"" color in the output.
- ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" gives a sequence where ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" based on their positions. ""wif"" adds ""red"" following both ""bluf"" and ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" appends ""red"" to the color sequence after translating the preceding non-""wif"" word to its associated color.
Based on the examples given, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs. It does not appear to depend on context or position within the input string. Thus, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be that it takes on the color of the preceding word. Let's analyze the examples to reach this conclusion:

1. ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" translates to ""red green red red yellow red"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is red, so ""bluf"" also becomes red.

2. ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which is green, so ""bluf"" also becomes green.

3. ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which is blue, so ""bluf"" also becomes blue.

4. ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" translates to ""yellow red red yellow blue"". Here ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is red, so ""bluf"" becomes red in this context.

5. ""zup dax bluf"" translates to ""yellow green green"". Here ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which is green, so ""bluf"" becomes green.

Every time the word ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a few things. 

Firstly, in each example, the term ""walm"" is associated with a sequence of a color being repeated. 

Here is the breakdown:

1. wif walm -> red red red
2. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
3. zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green
4. wif walm -> red red red
5. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red

We can see that in examples 1 and 4 where ""wif walm"" is given, the output is ""red red red"" indicating that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" results in the color being repeated three times.

In example 2, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green"", showing that ""walm"" makes the color before it repeat three extra times, totaling four times for ""lug"" and hence ""blue blue blue blue"".

Similarly, in example 3, ""lug"" which is before ""walm"" is repeated four times as ""blue"" showing consistency, and ""wif"" and ""dax"" maintain their color associations, ""red"" and ""green"" respectively.

Finally, in example 5, ""lug walm"" repeats ""blue"" three extra times besides its initial appearance, making it ""blue blue blue blue"", and ""wif"" retains its association with ""red"".

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word three additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in all provided examples.
Based on the examples provided, dax consistently corresponds with the color green in the output, regardless of its position in the input sentence or the words around it. As such, we can deduce the following:

dax -> green

Rule: The word dax, when used in the input, translates to the color green in the output.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" is always translated to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the output regardless of its position in the input.
Rule: bluf -> red
walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" can be deduced as repeating the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""walm.""

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the output is the color associated with the preceding word, repeated three times. For example:

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Given the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" represents the color ""green"". We can deduce this from the consistency of the color ""green"" immediately following the nonce word ""dax"" in each Output. Other words in the input seem to correspond to specific colors in the output as well.

Rule:
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""walm"" -> repeated occurrence of ""green""
- ""bluf"" -> red

Therefore:

dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif."" Let's inspect each correspondence:

- Input: wif zup bluf lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue
- Input: dax wif walm -> Output: green red red red
- Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
- Input: wif dax zup wif -> Output: red green yellow red
- Input: wif dax bluf -> Output: red green green

Here's what we can observe:

1. Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.
2. No other input word consistently translates to ""red.""
3. ""wif"" does not seem to change meaning based on position in the sequence.

Based on this, we can conclude that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" regardless of its position or the context within the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in all provided examples. 

Rule: zup means ""yellow"".
bluf -> meaning. From the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to repeating the color of the word immediately preceding it. If ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow."" Similarly, if ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""red."" The pattern suggests that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that comes right before it.

Rule: ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Therefore, each occurrence of ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color output previously mentioned. Here's the breakdown:

Examples:

1. zup dax walm lug wif → yellow green green green blue red
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which outputs green, thus ""walm"" also outputs green.

2. dax zup walm wif → green yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which outputs yellow, thus ""walm"" also outputs yellow.

3. lug walm zup walm → blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
   - The first ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which outputs blue, thus the first ""walm"" outputs blue.
   - The second ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which outputs yellow, so the second ""walm"" outputs yellow.

4. zup lug walm wif walm → yellow blue blue blue red red red
   - The first ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which outputs blue, thus the first ""walm"" outputs blue.
   - The second ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which outputs red, so the second ""walm"" outputs red.

5. dax walm wif walm zup → green green green red red red yellow
   - The first ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which outputs green, thus the first ""walm"" outputs green.
   - The second ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which outputs red, so the second ""walm"" outputs red.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color output associated with the word immediately preceding it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the consistent result whenever ""lug"" appears is the output ""blue."" Therefore, the meaning of lug is blue.

Rule: lug corresponds to the color blue.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look for patterns associated with its presence in the input and the corresponding segment in the output.

- In the first input, ""dax walm wif,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" to another ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" given that there is one ""red"" in the output. However, the addition of the word ""wif"" also changes the expected output color from green to red.
  
- In the second input, ""dax bluf,"" we see ""dax"" followed by ""green"" and ""bluf"" followed by ""green"" again.

- In the third input, ""dax wif,"" ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""

- In the fourth input, ""lug walm dax,"" we see all three other words besides ""dax"" yield ""blue,"" but ""dax"" yields ""green.""

- In the fifth input, ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup,"" we notice that ""dax"" corresponds with ""green"" just like the previous examples, and ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" with ""red,"" and ""wif"" with ""red.""

From these observations, we can establish a rule for ""dax"": it consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of the position in the input sequence or the other words present. Furthermore, the presence of ""dax"" does not seem to modify the output colors of the words around it, indicating that the meaning of ""dax"" is independent from its context within these given examples.

Rule: dax -> ""green""
Based on the provided examples, we can discern a pattern correlating the nonce word ""wif"" and the outputs given. In every instance where ""wif"" appears, the output includes the color ""red."" Therefore, it seems that ""wif"" translates to the color red.

wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" seems to correspond to the output ""yellow."" The other words in the inputs correspond to different colors in the outputs. For instance, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow."" The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" doesn't have a direct example to deduce its color, but based on the final input and output where ""walm"" is the only new element and an extra ""yellow"" appears in the output sequence, it suggests that ""walm"" might also correspond to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be that each unique nonce word in the input corresponds to a color in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color. Across all inputs, whenever the nonce word ""bluf"" is presented, the output is consistently ""yellow."" Therefore, we can determine the rule for the word ""bluf"" as follows:

bluf -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns surrounding the word in each example.

- In the second example ('zup walm'), the output is 'yellow yellow yellow.' Since 'zup' appears once and correlates with one 'yellow,' we can deduce that 'walm' likely means 'repeating the previous color.'
- In the third example ('dax wif walm lug zup'), we see 'green red red red blue yellow.' After 'dax' we have 'green,' and after 'wif' we have 'red,' followed by 'walm' and then a sequence of 'red.' Here 'walm' repeats the color 'red,' which was just mentioned.
- In the fourth example ('dax lug walm'), 'green blue blue blue' shows that 'dax' corresponds to 'green' and 'lug' to 'blue.' Following 'walm,' the color 'blue' is repeated.
- In the fifth example ('dax walm zup lug walm'), 'green' corresponding to 'dax' is repeated after 'walm,' and then 'lug' corresponds to 'blue,' which is also repeated after 'walm.'

From these patterns, we can deduce that:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning: Repeat the color mentioned just before 'walm' for the number of times 'walm' appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm zup
    ",Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow,red red red yellow,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" is mentioned in the input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output. Here is the rule induction:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, each word seems to correspond to a specific color:

- dax -> green
- bluf -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow

The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Every instance of the word ""zup"" in the input is directly translated to ""yellow"" in the output, independent of its position or the context within the string. Therefore, whenever ""zup"" appears, it consistently means ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
To figure out the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the given input-output pairs. We need to establish what each word corresponds to in terms of the color output.

We can start by identifying patterns for the known words. For instance, we know that:

- ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"".
- ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green"".

Now, let's look at the instances of ""bluf"":

1. In the first input ""wif zup bluf"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and then ""bluf"" results in another ""yellow"". 

2. In the second input ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"", we observe that ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and results in a second ""yellow"" before the sequence continues with ""red"" corresponding to ""wif"".

3. In the third input ""zup bluf"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow"".

4. In the fourth input ""dax bluf wif zup wif"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""bluf"" that follows results in another green, before the sequence continues with ""wif"" resulting ""red"".

5. Finally, in the fifth input ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"", it ends with ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"" followed by ""bluf"" which results in ""green"" again.

From these examples, it's noticeable that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. Thus, ""bluf"" seems to be a placeholder for ""repeat the color of the previous word"".

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word.
Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the previous color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the word ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sentence. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""lug"" is as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
By analyzing the given examples, I have observed the following correlations:

- Whenever 'wif' appears, it is followed by the word 'red' in the output.
- The word 'dax' correlates with 'green' when it follows 'wif', but also when it precedes it.
- The word 'bluf' only appears once, and it is followed by 'red red'. Since 'wif' always produces one instance of 'red', the 'bluf' may be responsible for the second 'red'.
- The word 'walm' seems to be linked with 'red' when it follows 'wif', but 'green' when it precedes 'dax' and is not directly associated with 'wif'.
- The position of 'zup' is correlated with 'yellow', but its relationship with 'wif' is not directly shown, as 'wif' precedes its resulting 'red'.

Based on the patterns observed, the rule can be deduced as follows:

wif -> 'red'

Rule: Whenever 'wif' is present, the immediate output is 'red'. Other words such as 'dax', 'walm', 'bluf', and 'zup' contribute additional colors based on their positioning and combination, but the presence of 'wif' consistently results in the word 'red' in the output sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Here are the correlations according to the examples:

- ""dax zup"" leads to ""green yellow"" (where ""dax"" likely corresponds to ""green"")
- ""zup lug dax"" results in ""yellow blue green"" (where ""lug"" likely corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green"")
- ""zup"" on its own translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug walm zup lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"" (where ""lug"" probably means ""blue"" and ""walm"" directly follows ""lug,"" thus might be of no change; ""zup"" means ""yellow"")
- ""lug dax zup lug wif"" results in ""blue green yellow blue red"" (where ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is likely ""red"")

Rule:
zup -> yellow
bluf -> copies the color word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another color word, it assumes the color value of that preceding word. If ""bluf"" is the first word or follows a non-color word, the default color it assumes is ""blue"".
Based on the given examples, we can infer that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. 

Here's how we can deduce this:

1. lug dax walm -> blue green green green
   ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""dax"" to green. ""walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times.

2. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
   ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

3. zup lug walm wif walm -> yellow blue blue blue red red red
   ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""wif"" corresponds to red. ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three times, and ""walm"" after ""wif"" results in ""red"" being repeated three times.

4. dax walm wif -> green green green red
   ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""wif"" corresponds to red. ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times.

5. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
   ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""wif"" corresponds to red. ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

From these observations, it appears that the general rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word exactly three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" Therefore, dax can be replaced by the word ""green.""

dax -> green.
Based on the examples given, each nonce word seems to correlate with a specific color:

- ""wif"" corresponds with ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds with ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds with ""yellow"" (deduced from example 3, where ""bluf"" is repeated as additional 'yellow')
- ""walm"" corresponds with ""red"" (deduced from examples 3 and 4, where ""walm"" appears more than once and always correlates with 'red')

From these examples, the word ""wif"" always results in the output ""red"", regardless of its position in the sequence. Hence, we can deduct the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
To discern the rule for the word ""zup,"" let's look at the output it produces in various contexts:

1. When ""zup"" follows ""wif walm"" or ""wif,"" it outputs yellow (the sequence ""wif zup"" appears multiple times).
2. When ""zup"" precedes ""wif,"" it again outputs yellow, maintaining a consistent output regardless of whether it comes before or after ""wif.""
3. The term ""zup"" does not seem to always produce the same color (yellow) when it follows other words, like ""bluf"" or ""dax."" 

Given these examples, it appears that ""zup"" may represent ""yellow"" consistently.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf means ""green"", but when it comes before or after the word ""dax"", which means ""green"", it means ""blue"".
walm -> meaning. 

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color word before it to be repeated three times. If ""walm"" follows a color-coded word (zup, lug, wif, dax), then the corresponding color for that word is repeated. For example, if ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow), then ""yellow"" is repeated three times in the output. If ""walm"" is not preceded by a recognized color-coded word, it does not have an effect on the output. Here is the breakdown of the color-coded words based on the examples:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green

So the word ""walm"" would translate to ""repeat the previous color three times.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug walm dax
    ",Output: red blue blue blue green,red blue blue blue green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color word ""green."" However, in some sequences, the other words (""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""walm"") are associated with other colors (""yellow,"" ""red,"" ""blue""). Additionally, it seems that the presence of ""dax"" in a string does not change the color associated with the surrounding words.

Here is the pattern that we can deduce from the examples:

- dax, when it appears by itself or with other words, corresponds to ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is preceded or followed by other words, those words have their own corresponding colors. For example, ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" also corresponds to ""blue.""

Given this information, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green. Each unique word corresponds to a color, and the output lists the colors for each word in the order they appear. The word ""dax"" specifically corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence.
Examining the provided examples, it appears that each instance of a nonce word is associated with a specific color. The word ""wif"" consistently results in the color ""red."" Even when ""wif"" is presented alone, the output is ""red,"" indicating that its meaning is not dependent on context within this set of data. Based on these examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position or surrounding words in the sentence. Therefore, the meaning of ""zup"" is clear.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at each instance of its use and identify a pattern in the outputs. Here are the patterns we see:

- ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue."" 
- ""wif dax bluf"" outputs ""red green green."" 
- ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" outputs ""green yellow red red blue."" 
- ""wif bluf lug zup"" outputs ""red red blue yellow.""
- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue blue red blue blue.""

From the examples, it seems that ""bluf"" is related to the duplication of the color code that comes just before it. 

In the first example, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" follows, resulting in ""blue blue."" 
In the second example, ""dax"" stands for ""green,"" and followed by ""bluf,"" it results in ""green green."" 
In the third example, ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" follows right after, resulting in ""red red.""
In the fourth example, again ""wif"" is ""red,"" and followed by ""bluf,"" leading to ""red red.""
In the fifth example, there are two ""lug"" before ""bluf,"" and after ""bluf,"" there are two ""blue,"" corresponding to those two instances of ""lug.""

Based on this, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" duplicates the color code that appears directly before it in the sequence. The number of duplications equals the number of times the color word preceding ""bluf"" occurs in the sequence.

bluf -> meaning: duplicate the preceding color code in the output, with the duplication count being equal to the count of the preceding color word in the input sequence.
Observing the patterns in the examples provided, it becomes apparent that the appearance of the nonce word ""walm"" dictates the output of the following colors which appear in triplicate, independent of the colors indicated by other words in the inputs. Each input word seems to associate with a specific color, and ""walm"" indicates repetition of that color three times:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Accordingly, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":
 
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax wif
    ",Output: blue green red,blue green red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of the context it is used in.

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output at the beginning of the sequence of colors.
To induce the rule for the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at each example and the output associated with it.

1. Input: dax zup bluf --> Output: green yellow yellow
2. Input: wif dax --> Output: red green
3. Input: dax bluf lug wif --> Output: green green blue red
4. Input: zup dax lug --> Output: yellow green blue
5. Input: zup dax --> Output: yellow green

From the examples given, it seems that every time the word ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output is ""green."" The color that comes after ""green"" depends on the word that comes after ""dax."" However, there's no immediately obvious rule relating the other words to their respective colors, as ""bluf"" appears twice and corresponds to both ""yellow"" and ""green"" in different contexts.

By observing just the use of the word ""dax"" and correlating it with the output, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, the color ""red"" shows up in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the patterns provided in the examples, it appears that ""bluf"" refers to the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Each time ""bluf"" is used, the output is a color word that matches the color assigned to the word that comes right before ""bluf"" in the input. Here is the observed pattern:

- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" meaning ""bluf"" takes the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.
- ""wif zup dax bluf"" translates to ""red yellow green green,"" meaning ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax,"" which is green.
- ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" translates to ""blue green green yellow blue red,"" meaning ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax,"" which is green.
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green,"" meaning ""bluf"" takes the color of ""wif,"" which is red.
- ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" meaning ""bluf"" takes the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.

Rule: bluf -> The same color as the word that comes immediately before it.
The input examples seem to follow a pattern that associates specific nonce words with the colors mentioned in the output. Here's the breakdown:

1. wif -> red
2. lug -> blue
3. dax -> green
4. bluf -> blue

Now let's focus on the appearances of ""walm"" across different examples:

- Every time ""walm"" appears, a sequence of ""blue blue"" follows it in the output.
- ""walm"" does not appear to have a one-to-one correspondence with a single ""blue"" (since ""lug"" already corresponds to a single ""blue"").
- The number of ""blue"" colors following ""walm"" is always two, regardless of the position or other words surrounding ""walm"".

Considering this pattern across all provided examples, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, it translates to two ""blue"" colors in the output.

Thus, we can infer:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: walm corresponds to ""blue blue"" in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The presence of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red"". Each instance of ""wif"" leads to ""red"" being outputted once.
Based on the examples provided, each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow."" Hence, it appears that the meaning of ""zup"" in the given context is directly linked to the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the given examples.
walm -> repeats the color indicated by the preceding word. Rule: When walm follows a word, it causes that word's associated color output to be repeated three times. If another word with an associated color comes after walm, the sequence generated by walm is followed by the color associated with the last word.

Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to the word ""yellow"". Each time ""zup"" is presented in the input, the corresponding ""yellow"" appears in the output, regardless of the position in the sequence or the words that follow it.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule:
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green.""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow.""
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue.""
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red.""

Each example suggests that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""green"" when it comes after the word ""dax."" Therefore, ""bluf"" most likely means ""green"" under the condition that it follows the word ""dax.""

bluf -> meaning: ""green"" when following the word ""dax.""
Rule: The word ""walm"" results in the immediate repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

walm -> meaning: Repeat the preceding color three times.

- In the first example, ""dax"" is associated with the color green, and when followed by ""walm,"" the output is three additional greens.
- In the second example, ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow, and when followed by ""walm,"" the output is three additional yellows.
- In the third example, ""dax"" once again precedes ""walm,"" resulting in three more greens in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""zup dax walm"" results in yellow, followed by green, then three more greens, and the pattern continues with the subsequent ""zup wif.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is associated with the color red, and following ""walm,"" there are three more reds.

Hence, ""walm"" triggers three iterations of the last mentioned color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position within the input sequence.
Rule: dax -> green

Each instance of the word ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif
   Output: red
   
2. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
   Output: blue green green red green

3. Input: lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red

4. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue

5. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow

Based on these examples, every time the word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red."" No matter its position in the sequence or the words around it, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red."" Therefore, we can determine that the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red

Meaning: ""wif"" translates directly to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the examples, it seems that the word 'bluf' corresponds to the color repeated directly before it. We see this pattern in each of the examples provided:

- In the first example, 'zup bluf' results in 'yellow yellow', indicating that 'bluf' takes the color of 'zup,' which is yellow.
- In the second example, 'bluf' follows 'wif,' and the output is 'red red.'
- In the third example, 'bluf' follows 'lug,' and the output is 'blue blue.'
- In the fourth example, the two instances of 'bluf' both follow 'zup' and 'wif' respectively, resulting in 'yellow yellow' and 'red red' accordingly.
- In the fifth example, 'bluf' follows 'dax,' and the output is 'green green.'

Rule: bluf -> the color that precedes it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to observe its occurrences in various contexts within the provided examples and note the corresponding output colors. Here are the patterns seen:

Example 1:
Input: zup wif dax walm
Output: yellow red green green green

Example 2:
Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

Example 3:
Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Example 4:
Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Example 5:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

The term ""walm"" appears multiple times with different preceding words, but the output is consistently three repetitions of the color that corresponds to the word immediately prior to ""walm."" That means ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" ""Walm"" hasn't appeared without a preceding word, hence we don't have a case for it being the first element in a sequence.

Based on the given information, we could postulate the following:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color that corresponds to the previous word three times in the output sequence.

Hence, walm -> meaning: Repeat the corresponding color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" represents the color blue.
dax -> green. Rule: Every instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it seems like ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here are the specific associations we can infer from the examples:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Given the pattern where ""bluf"" follows a word and that word's corresponding color is then repeated in the output, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
walm -> meaning. The meaning seems to be to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> meaning. Based on the repeated pattern in the examples, dax corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax means green.
Considering the examples provided where the nonce word ""wif"" is used, and correlating the occurrences of ""wif"" with the output colors given:

- Every time ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" appears in the output.
- The position of ""wif"" in the input does not affect the corresponding output; it is always ""red"" regardless of position.
- The occurrence of other words such as ""walm,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" produce different colors, but ""wif"" consistently produces ""red.""

Given this information, it can be deduced that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided where ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present, the rule seems consistent. Thus, we can infer:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the correlation between the input words and the respective color outputs:

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

In the first example, ""wif"" and ""bluf"" both produce ""red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" could be interpreted as the same color as the word preceding it. However, there's not enough information here to confirm this rule since it's the first occurrence.

Input: dax bluf zup
Output: green green yellow

Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the output is ""green green."" This supports the hypothesis that ""bluf"" assumes the color of the preceding word. The following word, ""zup,"" produces a different color, yellow.

Input: lug bluf dax bluf
Output: blue blue green green

Again, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the output is ""blue blue,"" while the last ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and produces ""green green."" This further supports the idea that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word before it.

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow,"" like the color for ""zup,"" which is consistent with our rule.

Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax
Output: green green yellow yellow green

The pattern holds: ""bluf"" after ""dax"" gives ""green,"" and ""bluf"" after ""zup"" gives ""yellow."" The repeated color indicates that ""bluf"" is indeed imitating the color of the word that comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we must look for patterns in each example.

Analyzing the provided examples:

1. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" 
   Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in other examples, we can isolate ""walm"" as relating to ""red red red.""

2. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red.""
   We can see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" as seen in other examples. ""wif"" does not appear in the Output, so it likely does not translate to a color by itself. The repeating ""walm"" seems to be responsible for ""red red red.""

3. ""lug walm zup walm"" yields ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow.""
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in another example, and we see that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" The repeating ""walm"" is consistent with multiple ""blue"" and ""yellow"" sequences, respectively.

4. ""dax walm"" gives ""green green green.""
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" The Output indicates that ""walm"" is translating to repeated ""green.""

5. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
   Similar to the previous examples, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" is translating to repeated ""yellow.""

By examining the outputs, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color word that comes immediately before it. The repetitions are consistent with the threefold appearance of the color word.

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. ""walm"" causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times.

Hence, the overall rule regarding the nonce word ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> The color word before ""walm"" is repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every given example.
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that each nonce word has a corresponding color.

dax -> green
bluf -> green
wif -> red
zup -> yellow
lug -> blue

Rule: Each nonce word is consistently translated into the same color output regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" There seems to be a one-to-one correspondence where each unique nonce word corresponds to a unique color. ""Lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" There is no additional context to suggest that ""wif"" changes its meaning depending on placement or other words in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule for the word ""wif"" is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it can be deduced that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Every input that contains the word ""zup"" consistently results in the output including the color ""yellow."" Here is how each example lines up with this rule:

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
(Rule: ""zup"" -> yellow, ""wif"" -> red)

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
(Rule: ""wif"" -> red, ""walm"" -> red, ""dax"" -> green, ""zup"" -> yellow)

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
(Same as the first example, reinforcing the rule)

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow
(Rule: ""lug"" -> blue, ""zup"" -> yellow)

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
(Rule: ""zup"" -> yellow, ""wif"" -> red, ""walm"" -> red)

Rule: zup -> yellow.
From the examples provided, we can deduce that ""bluf"" correlates with the color ""yellow."" Each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

bluf -> yellow

Rule: When the nonce word ""bluf"" is present in the input sequence, it translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output sequence.
By examining the patterns in the examples given, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Let's look at each occurrence of ""walm"":

1. In ""zup walm lug wif bluf,"" ""walm"" is followed by three ""yellow"" and then the colors change to match the other words (""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red"").
2. In ""lug walm,"" ""walm"" results in three repetitions of ""blue,"" the color associated with ""lug.""
3. In ""lug wif dax walm zup,"" after ""walm"" the output is three ""green"" (the color associated with ""dax"") followed by ""yellow"" associated with ""zup.""
4. In ""wif dax lug walm,"" after ""walm"" the output is three ""blue"" which corresponds to the word ""lug.""
5. In ""dax walm zup,"" after ""walm"" the output is three ""green"" which corresponds to the word ""dax"" before it switches to ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

From these patterns, we can infer that ""walm"" causes the next word's color to be output three times in sequence, before reverting back to the usual color pattern.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the following word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the provided examples, it is evident that ""lug"" consistently maps to the color ""blue."" Every example that includes the word ""lug"" results in ""blue"" being part of the output sequence. Hence, we can induce that ""lug"" denotes the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Every instance of ""dax"" in the input results in the word ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context within the input sequence.
wif -> meaning. From the examples provided, each occurrence of the word ""wif"" consistently leads to the output ""red."" Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each example includes ""zup"" and corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. The context does not seem to alter the meaning of ""zup,"" which suggests a consistent mapping to the color yellow.
Given the examples, we can look for patterns to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""bluf."" Let's examine the occurrences of ""bluf"" in each input and the corresponding output:

1. Input: wif bluf | Output: red red
2. Input: dax walm wif bluf | Output: green green green red red
3. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup | Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
4. Input: wif zup bluf lug | Output: red yellow yellow blue
5. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf | Output: yellow green yellow green red red

In each instance where ""bluf"" appears, there are two repeated colors following it in the output, irrespective of what preceded ""bluf."" This reliable occurrence across all given examples suggests that ""bluf"" corresponds to a repetition of the color word that follows it in the input list. 

Moreover, it is important to notice that the repeated color in the output corresponds to the word that comes directly after ""bluf"" in the input, translated to its color:

- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- No word after ""bluf"" but ""lug"" is a new word, and based on the pattern, it likely means ""blue""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""

Rule: bluf -> Causes the next word's corresponding color to be repeated twice in the output. If ""bluf"" is the last word and not followed by another, the new color ""blue"" appears.
Based on the examples provided, the term ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it three times, followed by the color ""red"" two times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times, and then add the color ""red"" two times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue regardless of its position in the sequence or the context provided by surrounding words.
Based on the provided examples, the word 'dax' consistently correlates with the color 'green' in the output. Each occurrence of 'dax' in the input leads to an instance of 'green' in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present. Other words seem to correlate with other specific colors (e.g., 'wif' correlating with 'red' and 'zup' correlating with 'yellow'). 

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, where ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red,"" the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" can be deduced as the color red.

Rule: wif means red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the given examples. Regardless of its position in the sequence of words, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
From the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" dictates the output color to be the same as the word that comes just before it.

1. ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"" translates to ""red red yellow yellow red"" (each ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word).
2. ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"" (again, ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word which is ""lug"")
3. ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"" (consistent with the above example).
4. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"" (again, ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup"").
5. ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" translates to ""red red blue green red"" (again, ""bluf"" matches the color of the word before it which is ""wif"" resulting in ""red"").

Rule:
bluf -> Takes on the color of the word immediately before it.
Reviewing the provided examples, let's analyze the patterns to identify the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

1. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

2. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red

3. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

5. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow

Looking at the outputs, whenever 'walm' is introduced in the input, a sequence of the same color followed by a 'red' appears in the output. It is important to note the number of repeated colors before the 'red' appears:

- In example 1, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', and after 'walm', we see three 'blue' outputs before the 'red'.
- In example 2, 'walm' is at the end and there are three 'red' after 'wif' which corresponds to 'red'.
- In example 3, 'walm' follows 'zup' which corresponds to 'yellow', and there are three 'yellow' outputs before the 'red'.
- In example 4, 'lug' which represents 'blue' is followed by 'walm', resulting in three 'blue' instances before a 'red'.
- In example 5, 'walm' follows 'wif' which represents 'red', and there are three 'red' before the 'yellow' corresponding to zup.

From the patterns observed, we can deduce the following rules:
- 'Walm' causes the color that precedes it to be repeated three times in the output before a 'red' is added.

Therefore, we can write the rule for 'walm' as:

walm -> repeat the preceding color three times followed by a red

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug wif
    ",Output: green blue red,green blue red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of the context in which it is used. Therefore, the rule for ""lug"" is as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word 'dax' consistently translates to the color 'green.'

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context it is used in.
zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of context or position in the sequence.
Analyzing the inputs and outputs, we can make the following observations:

- In every instance where the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, two ""red"" words appear consecutively in the corresponding output.
- The word ""bluf"" does not seem to affect the colors assigned to other words in the inputs.
- The words before ""bluf"" (e.g., ""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""zup"") are translated to colors and do not influence the outcome of ""bluf.""
- No matter the position of ""bluf"" in the input sequence, ""red red"" seems to follow its preceding word's assigned color in the output sequence.

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" corresponds to a double representation of the color ""red."" Thus, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" in the input is translated to ""red red"" in the output, regardless of the surrounding context.

Rule: bluf -> ""red red""
Rule: walm -> yellow

Looking at the examples provided where 'walm' is used, it consistently translates to 'yellow' in every output.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: 
Given the examples, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: The word 'dax' consistently translates to the color 'green' regardless of its position in the input sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the given examples.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Explanation: In each example, whenever the word ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position within the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that represents the word that comes immediately before it. If bluf is the first word or appears after a word representing a color, it defaults to ""blue."" Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""lug bluf"" resulted in ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" means ""blue"" and ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word, which in this case is blue.
- In the second example, ""zup bluf"" yielded ""yellow yellow,"" so ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" again takes on the color of the preceding word.
- In the third example, ""zup bluf"" turns into ""yellow yellow,"" reaffirming the rule for ""bluf"" and ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax bluf"" becomes ""green green,"" so ""dax"" means ""green,"" and ""bluf"" mimics the color of the preceding word.
- In the fifth example, ""lug bluf dax"" results in ""blue blue green,"" and ""zup bluf"" gives ""yellow yellow."" Again, ""bluf"" echoes the color of the word before it except for when ""bluf"" comes right after ""lug"" (blue), in which case ""bluf"" seems to maintain the color blue regardless of whether ""lug"" has appeared before it or not.

In essence:

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the preceding word; if preceded by a word that means ""blue"" or it's the first word, it remains ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" correlates with the color ""yellow."" Here's how the rule is applied based on each input and its corresponding output:

- Example 1: ""wif walm dax zup"" leads to ""red red red green yellow,"" where ""walm"" directly corresponds to a ""yellow"" output.
- Example 2: ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" leads to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red,"" where ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow.""
- Example 3: ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"" where again ""walm"" correlates with the ""yellow.""
- Example 4: ""wif zup walm dax zup"" leads to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow,"" with ""walm"" surrounded by ""yellow"" in the output.
- Example 5: ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" leads to ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue,"" and here we see that both occurrences of ""walm"" correspond to ""yellow.""

Rule: walm -> ""yellow""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds with the color ""green"" in the output. Whether ""dax"" is at the beginning, middle, or end of the input sequence, its associated output is always ""green."" Therefore, we can deduce the rule that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: It seems that every instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, irrespective of its position in the input sentence. The other words correspond to different colors: ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The meaning attached to ""wif"" appears to be consistent across the examples provided.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"". Therefore, the rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" seems to precede a word whose corresponding color is then changed to green in the output. Thus, if we consider ""dax"" to be an operation that changes the subsequent color to green, we can derive the following relations:

- ""lug walm dax wif"" results in ""blue blue blue green,"" meaning that ""dax"" changed ""wif"" which would have been red to green.

- ""wif bluf dax bluf"" results in ""red red green green,"" where the first ""bluf"" remains red, but the one following ""dax"" turns green.

- ""lug dax bluf"" gives us ""blue green green,"" showing that ""bluf"" which would have been red, is changed to green after ""dax.""

- ""zup dax"" simply yields ""yellow green,"" confirming that whatever word follows ""dax"" is transformed into green.

- Finally, ""lug dax wif lug"" results in ""blue green red blue,"" where we can see ""dax"" directly affecting ""wif"" which turns it to green, while the second ""lug"" remains blue.

From these observations, the rule is:
Rule: The word ""dax"" changes the color associated with the immediately following word to green.
wif -> red

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word zup consistently corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.
Rule: bluf -> green

The evidence lies in the second and fourth examples:

In the second example, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""blue red green green red blue"", which shows ""bluf wif"" results in ""green red"". Since ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red"", it indicates ""bluf"" is ""green"".

Similarly, in the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green"". The pattern shows ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax walm"", which results in ""green green green"", pointing again to ""bluf"" being ""green"", as ""dax"" also consistently translates to ""green"".

Given the consistency of these translations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" means ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word 'walm' corresponds to the repetition of the color word that precedes it three times. We see 'lug walm' consistently translates to 'blue blue blue'. Also, 'dax lug walm' translates to 'green blue blue blue', where 'lug' is translated to 'blue' and then 'walm' repeats the 'blue' three additional times. The same pattern applies to 'zup walm dax lug', where 'zup' translates to 'yellow' followed by 'walm' repeating 'yellow' three times, and 'lug' translates to 'blue' as established.

Therefore, the rule for 'walm' is:

walm -> Repetition of the preceding color word three times.

Rule: If 'walm' follows a color word, that color word is repeated three additional times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Whenever ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Therefore, the rule seems to be: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: In each instance, wif corresponds to the output ""red,"" regardless of the preceding word(s).
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
To figure out the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns for each example and the associated colors based on their position in the sentence and correlation to the output.

1. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   - ""wif"" correlates to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" correlates to ""red""
   - ""dax"" correlates to ""green""

2. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   - ""wif"" correlates to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" correlates to ""red""
   - ""lug"" correlates to ""blue""

3. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   - ""wif"" correlates to ""red""
   - ""dax"" correlates to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" correlates to ""green""

4. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
   Output: green green red yellow blue
   - ""dax"" correlates to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" correlates to ""green""
   - ""wif"" correlates to ""red""
   - ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" correlates to ""blue""

5. Input: zup wif bluf zup
   Output: yellow red red yellow
   - ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" correlates to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" correlates to ""red""
   - ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow""

From these examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" does not have a consistent color output associated with it. Instead, the output color of ""bluf"" seems to depend on the word that comes before it. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red""; when it follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green"". This suggests that ""bluf"" might copy the output color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> copies the color output of the word before it.
Examining the provided input and output sequences systematically, we can infer the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

For each input containing ""walm,"" the corresponding output contains a sequence of ""green,"" ""blue,"" or ""red.""

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red

Here, after ""walm,"" the colors are ""green"" repeated three times.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""blue"" repeated three times.

Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

In this sequence, ""walm"" is followed by three instances of ""yellow.""

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

""Walm"" here is followed by three ""red"" colors.

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

Once again, ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of three colors, this time first by ""red"" and then by ""blue"" after a series of other words.

From these observations, we can deduce a general rule that ""walm"" causes the output color to be repeated three times, matching the color of the word that is immediately preceding ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> The output for ""walm"" will be the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before ""walm,"" repeated three times.


    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in all the provided examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in every given example.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" indicates the color red, given that every output begins with ""red"" when ""wif"" is the first word in the input. Additionally, the other words seem to correspond to their own unique color:

- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to green.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

However, ""bluf"" has the same output color as ""dax,"" so the rules for those might be context-dependent, or they might each consistently map to the color green, we would need more examples to be sure. Nevertheless, the rule derived from the current examples is:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
zup -> yellow. Rule: The nonce word 'zup' corresponds to the color yellow.
bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Every time ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""blue.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns of input and output to uncover any rules that are consistent across examples.

- In the first example, the sequence ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" translates to a pattern of ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, the word ""walm"" corresponded to three ""yellow"" colors in sequence.

- In the second example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red."" Again, the word ""walm"" is followed by a triple color output.

- In the third example, ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue green red red green."" When ""walm"" appears, it follows the color blue repeating three times.

- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" translates to ""red red green green red red red blue red."" The ""walm"" word is followed by three repetitions of the color red.

- In the fifth example, ""wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" Similar to the first example, ""walm"" corresponds to three yellows here.

From these observations, it is consistent that the word ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of three colors. The color seems to be the same as the one that appears immediately before ""walm.""

Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates that the color of the word before it should be repeated three times in the output.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the examples given.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"". Regardless of the context or its position in the sequence, whenever ""dax"" is presented in the input, the corresponding output is ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" There is no context in the examples given where ""wif"" translates to anything other than ""red,"" regardless of where it appears in the sequence or the words around it.

Rule: wif -> red. ""Wif"" means ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, we can determine the meaning of ""zup"" by looking at its corresponding output in each case. The examples show a consistent pattern where ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output. There are no examples that contradict this observation, so we can induce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" follows another word, the output color for ""bluf"" is the same as the color output for the word that precedes it.
The examples given indicate that the word ""walm"" results in the output of a repetition of a color word three times. The color seems to be dependent on the word that comes immediately before ""walm."" Based on the examples, here are the rules that can be derived:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Therefore, it seems that the word ""walm"" functions as a command to repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it, three times.

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the associated color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the given examples.
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, each word appears to be associated with a specific color in the output. To determine the meaning of the word ""wif,"" let's look at each instance and the corresponding output color:

1. wif walm dax -> red red red green
2. zup wif lug -> yellow red blue
3. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue
4. wif bluf -> red red
5. lug dax lug wif -> blue green blue red

In every instance where ""wif"" appears, the output consistently has the color ""red"" associated with it. Therefore, it seems the word ""wif"" translates to ""red"" in the context of these examples.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in all outputs regardless of its position or the other words present.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeats the color associated with the word before it. Rule: If a word has a corresponding color, ""bluf"" following that word causes the output to be the color associated with the preceding word repeated twice.
Analyzing the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

In every given input-output pair, the presence of ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color output of the word before it. For example, in the first input ""dax walm lug"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" corresponds to a single ""blue"". When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the word ""green"" is followed by three additional ""green"" outputs.

Let's examine the patterns:

- Input: dax walm lug
  Output: green green green blue 
  Rule: ""dax"" -> green, ""walm"" repeats the previous color code (green), ""lug"" -> blue 

- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
  Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
  Rule: ""wif"" -> red, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""bluf"" -> yellow, ""lug"" -> blue, ""walm"" repeats the previous color code (blue), ""dax"" -> green, ""lug"" -> blue

- Input: zup lug walm
  Output: yellow blue blue blue
  Rule: ""zup"" -> yellow, ""lug"" -> blue, ""walm"" repeats the previous color code (blue)

- Input: dax lug walm
  Output: green blue blue blue
  Rule: ""dax"" -> green, ""lug"" -> blue, ""walm"" repeats the previous color code (blue)

- Input: zup wif dax walm
  Output: yellow red green green green
  Rule: ""zup"" -> yellow, ""wif"" -> red, ""dax"" -> green, ""walm"" repeats the previous color code (green)

Based on the consistent application of this rule in each example, we can deduce the following:

walm -> meaning: To repeat the color of the preceding word multiple times (specifically, it seems to be three repetitions based on the examples).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in each provided example.
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
bluf -> meaning. Rule: 'bluf' means 'the color of the word that precedes it'. In each example, 'bluf' assumes the color associated with the word that comes directly before it. For instance, when 'lug' precedes 'bluf', the output is 'blue blue', indicating that 'bluf' takes on the color of 'lug', which is 'blue'.
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to produce a repetition of the color associated with the word prior to ""walm"". For instance, when ""zup walm"" is given, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"", indicating that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"", and ""walm"" leads to a triplet repetition of that color.

Here's how ""walm"" behaves in each input:

1. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" – ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) three times.
2. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" – ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""wif"" (red) three times and then repeats the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) three times.
3. ""dax walm zup walm"" – ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"" (green) three times and then repeats the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) three times.
4. ""zup walm"" once again results in ""yellow yellow yellow"".
5. ""lug zup dax walm"" – ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"" (green) three times.

From these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the preceding color word's color to be outputted three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the preceding color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word 'lug' directly translates to the color blue in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the occurrence of the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. This consistency suggests that ""dax"" directly translates to the color ""green"" without dependency on context. Therefore:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. The repeated instances of specific words matching specific colors make it clear that there's a one-to-one relationship between certain words and colors. 

Now, let's analyze the instances where ""wif"" appears and the corresponding output.

- In example 1 (dax bluf wif), ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In example 2 (wif walm), ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" in the output.
- In example 3 (zup dax wif zup), the word ""wif"" once again corresponds to the color ""red"" whilst ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""
- In example 4 (wif dax wif), ""wif"" both times corresponds to ""red,"" so again, ""wif"" relates to ""red"" and ""dax"" relates to ""green.""
- In example 5 (zup lug bluf zup bluf wif), the word ""wif"" is at the end and matches to ""red,"" ""zup"" matches to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" matches to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" matches to ""blue.""

Given these observations, we can deduce that:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow."" Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output. 

Rule: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> duplicate the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: When the nonce word ""bluf"" follows another word, replace ""bluf"" with the word that came before it.
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be connected with repeating the color associated with the word that precedes it. In each instance, the color that is repeated is the one associated with the word right before ""walm"". 

Hence, the rule appears to be:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". Other words in the examples correspond to other colors; for instance, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""bluf"" also to ""red"". It appears that each word maps directly to a color.

The rule is:

wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Bluf -> the color that corresponds to the preceding word in a given sequence. Rule: The output color for ""bluf"" is determined by first identifying the color associated with the word that comes directly before ""bluf."" Here's the mapping we've deduced from the examples:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green

For instance, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" because the color associated with ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word preceding it, which in this case is also red. Similarly, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" is associated with blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns associated with each word and how they correspond to the colors provided in the Output.

First, notice the color pattern associated with each word not including ""walm"":

- ""dax"" consistently results in ""green""
- ""wif"" consistently results in ""red""
- ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue""
- ""zup"" consistently results in ""yellow""

Next, let's look at the position of ""walm"" and see how it influences the output:

- In the first example, ""walm"" appears twice, and each occurrence leads to a repetition of the color corresponding to the previous word ""wif"" and ""dax"".
- In the second and third examples, ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color associated with the word just before it, ""lug"" and ""wif"" respectively.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in a repetition of ""green"".
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and leads to a repetition of ""blue"", and then ""wif"" follows ""walm"" and changes the color to ""red"", indicating that ""walm"" doesn't impact the color after it but instead repeats the previous color.

Based on the examples, we can induce a rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" is encountered, it results in the repetition of the output color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm"". It does not impact the color associated with words that follow it.

Therefore:

walm -> Repetition of the preceding word's associated color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. When present, it is always followed by the word 'green' in the output, regardless of its position in the input sentence. Therefore, we can deduce a simple rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the output for the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of the context in which it appears. The rule seems straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow

This means that ""zup"" represents the color yellow.
Based on the given examples, it seems reasonable to deduce that the nonce word 'bluf' translates to the color 'red'. However, it appears that in some contexts, 'bluf' outputs 'yellow' or 'blue' instead. Let's look more closely at the examples to discern the underlying rule:

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
Output: green green red blue yellow

Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Considering 'bluf' outputs 'red' consistently after 'wif', we can tentatively establish that one rule is:

- 'bluf' following 'wif' translates to 'red'.

In instances where 'bluf' is not directly preceded by 'wif', it seems to take on the color of the word right before it:

- 'zup' precedes 'bluf' and translates to 'yellow' (Input 1, Input 3).
- 'lug' precedes 'bluf' and translates to 'blue' (Input 4).

One outlier to the above patterns is that when 'bluf' follows 'dax', which translates to 'green', the output is not 'green' but 'blue'. We can deduce from this that perhaps 'dax' followed by 'bluf' creates an exceptional rule:

- When 'dax' is followed by 'bluf', the output is 'blue' regardless of 'dax' meaning 'green'.

With this examination, we can summarize the rule for 'bluf' as:

Rule:
- 'bluf' -> 'red' when preceded by 'wif'.
- 'bluf' -> color of the word that precedes it, except when preceded by 'dax', then it translates to 'blue'.
- When 'bluf' stands alone with no context, it maintains the 'red' translation as seen in Example 5.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the examples and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   Analysis: ""zup"" seems related to yellow, ""dax"" to green, ""wif"" to red.

2.  Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
    Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
    Analysis: ""lug"" seems related to blue, ""bluf"" also appears to be blue, ""zup"" to yellow.

3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   Analysis: ""wif"" is red, likely red repeating due to ""walm.""

4. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   Analysis: ""zup"" is related to yellow, ""wif"" is red, ""walm"" is associated with repeating the preceding color.

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" to blue, ""walm"" results in the repetition of blue.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated in the output until another color word is encountered, or the sequence ends.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the preceding color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the outputs, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: The presence of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green."" Each occurrence of ""dax"" results in the word ""green"" being produced in the output. Other words correlate with other colors - for example, ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" is associated with the color red. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" is included in the output. Additionally, it seems that other words may have corresponding colors as well; for example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Here is the induction of the rules based on the examples:

- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- ""walm"" seems to repeat the last mentioned color three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" is:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word zup is associated with the color yellow. Each time zup is mentioned, the output is yellow, regardless of the context or additional words. Consequently, zup corresponds to the word yellow.
The pattern suggests that bluf seems to repeat the color of the word that precedes it. 

Looking at each instance:
1. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" -> blue red blue green green. Here, bluf repeats the color of ""dax"" which is green.
2. ""wif bluf dax"" -> red red green. Here, bluf repeats the color of ""wif"" which is red.
3. ""dax zup lug bluf"" -> green yellow blue blue. Here, bluf repeats the color of ""lug"" which is blue.
4. ""dax lug wif bluf"" -> green blue red red. Here, bluf repeats the color of ""wif"" which is red.
5. ""dax zup bluf"" -> green yellow yellow. Here, bluf repeats the color of ""zup"" which is yellow.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
Rule: walm -> red

The word ""walm"" consistently translates to the color red in each example provided.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Each position of the word ""dax"" in the input leads to the inclusion of ""green"" in the exact same position in the output sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the last color mentioned. The word ""wif"" seems to consistently correspond to ""red."" It acts as a standalone term that doesn't depend on previous context, as it can appear at the beginning or in the midst of other terms without changing its output.

Here is what we can assess about the other words as well:

- ""dax"" always leads to a single ""green.""
- ""lug"" always leads to a single ""blue.""
- ""walm"" repeats the color that came before it, as seen in the second and fourth examples; when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it repeats ""red,"" and when it follows ""dax,"" it repeats ""green.""

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" can be:

Rule: wif -> ""red""
zup -> yellow.

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in all given examples.
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""green"" whenever it follows the word ""dax."" When ""bluf"" is following any other word, it translates to either ""red"" or ""yellow,"" depending on the preceding word. Let's investigate further:

From example 1:
- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red""
- ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green""
- ""wif walm lug wif"" results in ""red red red blue red"" with no ""bluf"" in this sequence

From example 2:
- ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow""

From example 3:
- ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" results in ""green yellow blue yellow yellow,"" 
 so ""zup bluf"" at the end gives ""yellow yellow,"" similar to example 2.

From example 4:
- ""wif bluf lug"" results in ""red red blue,"" where ""bluf"" is not directly after ""dax,"" so it's ""red.""

From example 5:
- ""dax bluf zup"" results in ""green green yellow,"" and ""bluf"" after ""dax"" here is ""green.""

Rule: ""bluf"" means ""green"" when it follows ""dax."" Otherwise, ""bluf"" means ""red"" after ""wif"" and ""yellow"" after ""zup.""

Bluf -> meaning:
- After ""dax"" = ""green""
- After ""wif"" = ""red""
- After ""zup"" = ""yellow""
Analyzing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, the word ""walm"" seems to influence the color repetition based on the color the preceding word translates to. Each instance of ""walm"" triples the color word that comes before it.

Here are the observations in detail:

1. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red green green green blue"". The word ""dax"" which translates to ""green"" is followed by ""walm"" and this results in ""green"" being repeated three times. 

2. ""lug dax walm"" translates into ""blue green green green"", again showing the word ""dax"" before ""walm"" causing ""green"" to be repeated three times.

3. ""wif walm"" translates into ""red red red"". ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and is followed by ""walm"", making ""red"" repeat three times.

4. ""zup walm wif"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow red"". Here, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and is immediately followed by ""walm"", resulting in ""yellow"" being repeated three times before getting to ""wif"", which is ""red"".

5. ""zup dax walm"" translates to ""yellow green green green"". ""dax"" translates to ""green"" followed by ""walm"", causing the ""green"" to be repeated three times.

So, the rule for ""walm"" becomes:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, repeat the color translation of that word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup dax
    ",Output: blue yellow green,blue yellow green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue, regardless of its position or the context within which it is used.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the output color sequence appears to be dependent on the input sequence in a direct manner. Each input word seems to correspond to a specific color in the output.

Let's align the inputs and outputs to see if we can derive a rule for each input word:

1. lug dax walm wif -> blue green green green red
2. zup wif dax walm lug -> yellow red green green green blue
3. zup lug zup dax -> yellow blue yellow green
4. zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green
5. dax lug -> green blue

From these alignments, if we take a closer look at the position of ""dax"" and its corresponding output color, we can derive the following associations:

- In example 1, ""dax"" is second in sequence and the second color is green.
- In example 2, ""dax"" is third in sequence and the third color is green.
- In example 3, ""dax"" is last (fourth) in sequence and the fourth color is green.
- In example 4, ""dax"" is last (third) in sequence and the third color is green.
- In example 5, ""dax"" is first in sequence and the first color is green.

From these observations, we see that regardless of its position in the sequence, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in the output.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, we observe that when ""wif"" appears in the input, it is replaced with ""red"" in the output. Additionally, the word ""wif"" seems to be independent of its position in the sequence, indicating that its translation into ""red"" is consistent regardless of context. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rule governing the use of ""zup"" by comparing the inputs and the outputs to see how they correspond.

1. When ""zup"" is followed by ""lug walm,"" the output is ""yellow blue blue blue,"" which suggests that ""zup"" might correspond to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" might correspond to a variation of ""blue,"" and ""walm"" might correspond to ""blue.""

2. When the order is reversed to ""zup walm lug,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" indicating ""zup"" is still ""yellow,"" ""walm"" might change the color property, and ""lug"" is consistently ""blue.""

3. When ""zup"" precedes ""wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow red red red,"" reinforcing that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" might correspond to ""red"" and either ""walm"" repeats the color that comes directly before it or has a different rule.

4. ""Dax zup"" becomes ""green yellow,"" which continues to support that ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

5. ""Wif zup"" becomes ""red yellow,"" once again suggesting ""zup"" means ""yellow.""

Given these observations, we can conclude that irrespective of the context or words that come before or after it, ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, the word 'bluf' correlates with the color 'red' being repeated twice in the output. The input 'bluf' always results in 'red red' regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it. Thus, the rule for 'bluf' seems to be that it translates to 'red red' in the output.

Rule: bluf -> red red
walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears, it takes the color associated with the preceding word and repeats that color three times as the output. For example, in ""lug walm,"" the color associated with ""lug"" is blue, so the output is ""blue blue blue.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif dax walm
    ",Output: blue red green green green green,blue red green green green,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"".

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue"".
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""dax"" translates to a specific color output whenever it appears in an input. Comparing the outputs between examples where “dax” appears and those where it doesn’t, we can isolate the effect of “dax” on the output:

1. In the first example, ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow,"" and in the fourth example, ""wif dax zup dax"" leads to ""red green yellow green."" When comparing these two, ""walm"" is replaced by ""dax,"" and the second ""red"" becomes ""green"" in the output. 

2. Additionally, a second ""dax"" appears at the end instead of ""dax,"" which seems to replace ""zup"" causing a second ""green"" instead of a ""yellow."" This suggests a one-to-one correspondence between ""dax"" and ""green"" in the output.

3. In the third example, the sole input ""dax"" results in the output ""green,"" which directly suggests that ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

4. Again, in the fourth example, ""dax"" is associated with green both times it appears.

5. In the fifth example, ""zup lug dax"" results in ""yellow blue green,"" with ""dax"" being the last word and ""green"" being the last color.

Therefore, the consistent translation is that every instance of the word ""dax"" results in the color ""green"" in the output. Thus, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: When the word 'wif' is mentioned in the input, the output always contains 'red'. It can also be inferred that 'dax' corresponds to 'green', and the order matters such that 'dax' before 'wif' yields ""green red"", while 'wif' before 'dax' yields ""red green"".
Based on the given examples, zup consistently translates to the color yellow. Each time the word zup appears in the input, the color yellow appears in the same position in the output. The color associated with dax is green and the color associated with wif is red.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To determine the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns associated with each occurrence of ""bluf"" in the provided input and its corresponding output. Here are the observations:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" is present, the output for it is always the same color.
2. The color that corresponds to ""bluf"" does not change regardless of its position in the sentence or the presence of other words.
3. ""bluf"" appears to have no effect on the color designation of other words; it has its own distinct output color.

From these observations, the following rule can be deduced:

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green."" 

Therefore, in terms of the rule induction:
bluf -> ""green""
Rule: The word ""walm"" means repeating the color of the previous word.

Explanation: In each example, the color that follows ""walm"" is a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes ""walm.""

1. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.
   
2. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.

3. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is red.

4. In the fourth example, ""wif walm dax"" yields ""red red red green,"" where ""walm"" repeats the red color of ""wif,"" and then the sequence continues to ""dax,"" which is a new color, green.

5. In the last example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" demonstrating again that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it. ""walm wif"" leads to ""green red,"" showing that after the repetition induced by ""walm,"" the pattern continues with the next color word, ""wif,"" which is red.

Therefore, walm -> meaning. Walm means repeating the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax lug walm
    ",Output: yellow green blue blue blue,yellow green blue blue blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rule:

dax -> green

The meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green"" in the given examples. Each occurrence of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. 

Rule: ""dax"" means ""green"".
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" is replaced by the color ""red"".

Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". There are no examples that contradict this association, and every time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" means ""yellow"".
To understand the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can examine the patterns in the words and their corresponding colors from the given examples:

1. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
2. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
3. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
4. zup wif bluf zup lug -> yellow red red yellow blue
5. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue

By looking at these examples, we can infer the following color assignments for the words that are not ""bluf"":

- zup corresponds to yellow
- wif corresponds to red
- walm corresponds to red
- lug corresponds to blue
- dax corresponds to green

Now let's look at the appearances of ""bluf"" in each example and the color that it translates to in the output:

1. zup (yellow) bluf (yellow) wif (red) walm (red)
2. lug (blue) walm (red) wif (red) bluf (red)
3. zup (yellow) dax (green) bluf (green)
4. zup (yellow) wif (red) bluf (red) zup (yellow) lug (blue)
5. lug (blue) wif (red) lug (blue) bluf (blue)

From these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. For example, if ""zup"" (yellow) comes before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" is also yellow; if ""lug"" (blue) comes before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" is also blue.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> The color of ""bluf"" is the same as the color of the word that comes immediately before it in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns for each input and their corresponding output colors. We notice that ""walm"" seems to always result in ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position within the input string. Moreover, the sequence appears to maintain a pattern related to individual words:

- ""wif"" correlates to ""red""
- ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" correlates to ""blue""
- ""dax"" correlates to ""green""

Given that ""walm"" also results in ""green,"" we can infer that ""walm"" possibly shares some properties with ""dax,"" since they produce the same color output. However, we need to differentiate ""walm"" from ""dax,"" because if they were the same, the string ""dax walm wif"" would have yielded ""green green red"" instead of ""green green green red."" The triplication of ""green"" suggests that ""walm"" has a unique property of triggering the color ""green"" for itself and the preceding word, irrespective of what the preceding word is.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

**Rule:** When ""walm"" appears in an input string, it induces the output ""green"" for itself and also causes the immediately preceding word in the input string to output ""green,"" irrespective of the usual color associated with that preceding word. If ""walm"" is the first word in the sequence, it simply outputs ""green"" for itself.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue
dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the examples and the corresponding outputs:

1. ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" gives ""yellow yellow red green red yellow""
2. ""dax wif"" gives ""green red""
3. ""zup wif zup"" gives ""yellow red yellow""
4. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" gives ""blue red green green red blue""
5. ""lug walm wif lug"" gives ""blue blue blue red blue""

Looking at examples 2 and 3, the word ""wif"" appears between two identical words (""dax"" and ""zup"", respectively) and the corresponding output for ""wif"" is ""red"". In example 5, ""wif"" also appears between two identical words (""lug"") and the corresponding output is again ""red"".

In examples 1 and 4, ""wif"" is preceded and followed by different words, and the output for ""wif"" in each case is still ""red"".

From these observations, we can infer that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"", regardless of the context it appears in.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> yellow when following zup, blue when following lug, and red when following wif.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to repeated tokens of a color that directly follows in the output. Each instance of ""walm"" leads to three repetitions of a specific color in the output:

- In the first example, ""zup dax walm"" in input corresponds to ""yellow green green green"" in output, inferring that ""walm"" causes the word ""green"" to repeat three times.
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" in input corresponds to ""green green green"" in output, supporting the earlier inference.
- In the third example, ""zup walm lug"" in input corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue"" in output, suggesting again that ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times.
- Similarly, in the fourth and fifth examples, ""lug walm"" corresponds to three repeated instances of the color ""blue.""

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the next color word in the sequence to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" correlates with the color blue, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
Rule: zup -> yellow

From the examples provided, every instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow,"" irrespective of what other words are present in the input. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as ""zup"" meaning ""yellow.""
Observing the patterns in the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the output of having two color words that are the same. Additionally, we see that each word before ""bluf"" has a distinct corresponding color in the output.

Let's break down the instances:

1. ""walm"" consistently results in ""yellow.""
2. ""wif"" consistently results in ""red.""
3. ""dax"" consistently results in ""green.""
4. ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue.""

Given this pattern, ""bluf"" seems to signify the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. For example:

- In ""zup walm lug wif bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" hence the output ""red red.""
- In ""dax bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and thus the output is ""green green.""
- In ""lug bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" giving us the output ""blue blue.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is: ""bluf"" results in two consecutive words in the output that are the same color as the word that comes immediately before ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color associated with the preceding word in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to result in the repetition of the color that precedes it. Here's the breakdown of each provided input and output.

1. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   After ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   After ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.

3. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   After ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   After ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

5. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   After ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the last color word before it to be repeated three times. 

Rule: walm -> causes the last mentioned color to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, every time the nonce word ""dax"" is used, the output is ""green."" Regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"".
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. When ""wif"" appears in the input, the output always includes ""red"".
Rule: zup -> yellow

Explanation: In all the given inputs, the nonce word 'zup' consistently corresponds to the output 'yellow.' There are no instances where 'zup' results in a different output, which is strongly suggestive that the rule for 'zup' is that it translates directly to the color 'yellow.'
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" through pattern recognition.

1. ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" produces ""green green red yellow red."" The repeated word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""

2. ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" produces ""red green yellow red green green."" Here ""dax"" before ""bluf"" produces a sequence of ""green green.""

3. ""dax bluf zup"" produces ""green green yellow."" Again, ""dax"" before ""bluf"" results in ""green green.""

4. ""wif bluf"" produces ""red red."" Here ""wif"" before ""bluf"" results in ""red red.""

5. ""zup bluf lug zup"" produces ""yellow yellow blue yellow."" The word ""zup"" before ""bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow.""

From these examples, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word that came before it, repeating that color in the output. 

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the previous word.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color related to the preceding word. To deduce the rule for ""walm,"" let's look at the first example:

Input: wif walm zup walm
Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow

The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" and following ""walm,"" the color ""red"" is repeated twice. Similarly, ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" the color ""yellow"" is also repeated twice. 

Let's apply this understanding to the rest of the inputs:

- Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
  Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
  ""Lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated twice.

- Input: zup bluf wif walm
  Output: yellow yellow red red red
  ""Wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated twice.

- Input: zup walm
  Output: yellow yellow yellow
  ""Zup"" is ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated twice more.

- Input: zup lug walm
  Output: yellow blue blue blue
  ""Lug"" is ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated twice.

Rule: walm -> triggers a repetition of the color associated with the previous word twice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax wif
    ",Output: blue green red,blue green red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's look at the outputs corresponding to the inputs involving ""lug"" while also taking into account the other words and their respective outputs:

1. dax lug bluf dax -> green blue blue green
2. wif lug -> red blue
3. lug wif zup wif -> blue red yellow red
4. zup wif lug -> yellow red blue
5. zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green green red

Let's match the inputs with ""lug"" to their outputs:

1. dax (green) lug (blue) bluf (blue) dax (green)
2. wif (red) lug (blue)
3. lug (blue) wif (red) zup (yellow) wif (red)
4. zup (yellow) wif (red) lug (blue)
5. zup (yellow) lug (blue) wif (red) dax (green) bluf (green) wif (red)

Based on the given examples, it consistently appears that ""lug"" is paired with the output ""blue."" Thus, lug likely means blue.

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

This rule is deduced from the given examples where each occurrence of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, it seems that 'wif' consistently corresponds to the output of 'red'. No matter the position in the input sequence or the surrounding words ('zup', 'dax', 'walm'), the presence of 'wif' always results in adding 'red' to the output sequence. There are two instances where 'wif' is the only word in the input, and both times the output is solely 'red'. As the other words ('zup', 'dax', 'walm') correspond to other specific colors in the outputs, it becomes more evident that 'wif' uniquely translates to 'red'.

Rule: wif -> 'red'
zup -> meaning. Based on the given examples, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"". The presence of another word following ""zup"" results in the mention of another color, but ""zup"" alone consistently corresponds to ""yellow"". 

Rule: ""zup"" means ""yellow"".
bluf -> meaning: red. 

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color red in the outputs given.
walm -> meaning. Meaning appears to be the repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" for the number of times ""lug"" appears before ""walm,"" or once if ""lug"" does not appear. Rule: If ""lug"" is present before ""walm,"" repeat the color corresponding to the word right before ""walm"" for the number of times ""lug"" appears; if ""lug"" is not present, repeat the color once.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug
    ",Output: yellow red blue,yellow yellow blue,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

- When ""dax"" occurs alone, the output is ""green"".
- When ""dax"" is accompanied by ""wif"", the output associated with ""dax"" is still ""green"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- Even when ""dax"" is preceded or followed by other words, such as ""bluf"" or ""zup"", the output for ""dax"" remains ""green"".
- ""zup"" preceding ""dax"" results in ""yellow"" preceding ""green"".
- ""lug"" between ""dax"" and ""wif"" is associated with ""blue"".

Therefore, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds consistently to the color ""green"", regardless of its position in the input sequence. On the other hand, ""wif"", ""bluf"", ""zup"", and ""lug"" seem to correspond to ""red"", ""green"", ""yellow"", and ""blue"" respectively, regardless of their position or the presence of ""dax"".

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of the context or position within the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the output ""red,"" irrespective of context or position within the sequence of words. Other non-wif words also seem to have a one-to-one correspondence with certain colors (e.g., ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""). Therefore, ""wif"" functions as an identifier for the color red in the examples given.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the series of words.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns between the inputs and outputs for each line:

Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
Output: blue red red blue red
- The pattern suggests that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Since ""bluf"" occurs between ""red"" and ""blue,"" it does not have a direct color correspondence, yet it results in a repetition of the previous color.

Input: zup bluf wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow red red
- Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is repeated ""yellow."" When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output repeats ""red.""

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" results in another ""blue.""

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" once again results in repeating the previous color, ""red.""

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue
- Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" leads to the repetition of the same color, ""blue.""

Rule:
Given the patterns, ""bluf"" seems to operate as a color duplicator. It does not have a fixed color meaning but instead repeats the color given before it.

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the previous color mentioned.
Rule: walm -> the color associated with the preceding word repeated once for each letter in the preceding word. 

- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"" because ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""dax"" has three letters.
- ""dax lug wif walm"" translates to ""green blue red red red"" has ""wif"" before ""walm,"" which is associated with red, and ""wif"" has three letters.
- ""dax wif walm"" follows the same rule: ""wif"" is before ""walm,"" which is associated with red, and ""wif"" has three letters.
- ""zup wif dax walm lug"" - the word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which is associated with green, and ""dax"" has three letters.
- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and ""zup"" has three letters.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" I will analyze the pattern between the input and output.

In the first example, ""lug"" is associated with a sequence of ""red blue."" 

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

But in the second example, ""lug"" is associated with just ""blue.""

Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
Output: green green red yellow blue

In the third example, ""lug"" appears twice, and each time it is followed by ""blue.""

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

In the fourth example, ""lug"" appears at the beginning and yields ""blue.""

Input: lug dax bluf
Output: blue green green

Likewise, in the fifth example, ""lug"" also corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: zup wif lug dax
Output: yellow red blue green

From these examples, we see that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or other words present.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently correlates with the output ""green."" Regardless of the other words in the input (such as ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" or ""walm""), ""dax"" always maps to ""green"" in the output. The other words correspond to different colors: ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" and ""walm"" to ""blue."" 

Rule:
dax -> green
Based on the given examples, ""wif"" results in the output ""red"" consistently, regardless of the presence of other words. The word ""dax"" results in ""green"" and appears to maintain that meaning whether it is before or after ""wif"". Therefore, it seems that ""wif"" has a standalone meaning that is not influenced by the words around it.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. In each instance, the position of ""zup"" within the input sequence does not appear to change its corresponding output. It consistently translates to yellow regardless of its position or the presence of other words.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> The color word preceding bluf, repeated twice.
Analyzing the given examples, it appears that the presence of the word ""walm"" in the input causes all the words preceding ""walm"" to produce the same output color. Here is how each example breaks down:

In the first example:
- ""wif walm dax"" all turn red, indicating ""walm"" causes ""wif"" to turn from its usual color to red.
- ""zup"" occurs both before and after ""walm"" and results in different colors (red before walm and yellow after), reinforcing the 'preceding words' rule.

In the second example:
- ""zup walm dax zup"" turns to yellow until ""walm"" while the second ""zup"" after ""walm"" remains yellow and ""dax"" turns green, indicating that the effect of ""walm"" does not extend to words after it.
- ""wif"" at the end of the string turns red, which is its typical color observed in the first example.

The third example:
- ""zup wif"" all turn red following the word ""walm"".

The fourth example:
- ""dax walm wif"" all turn green due to ""walm"".
- ""bluf"" turns red after ""walm"", so ""bluf"" is unaffected by ""walm"".

The fifth example:
- ""lug walm"" all turn blue, while ""wif"" turns red, which follows the established rule for ""wif"" outside the influence of ""walm"".
- The last ""lug"" remains blue, its original color unaffected by ""walm"".

From these examples, we can induce the rule that ""walm"" causes all words that precede it to change to the same color. However, this effect does not extend to words that follow ""walm"".

Rule: ""walm"" affects the color output of every word that precedes it in the sequence, making them all output the same color. The color chosen depends on the word ""walm""'s position; it doesn't follow a consistent color itself but affects preceding words.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Observing the inputs and their associated outputs, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". To further validate this conclusion, let's examine the role of ""lug"" in each example:

- In the first input, ""lug"" is directly followed by a color output ""blue.""
- In all cases, regardless of the position of ""lug"" in the sequence (beginning, middle, end), it consistently maps to the color ""blue.""

Even though the other words also seem to map to certain colors, we are focusing on the word ""lug."" Based on the examples given, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. It maintains this meaning regardless of its position in the string of words.

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the given examples, everytime the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is always ""red"", regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words. Therefore, the word ""wif"" equates to the color ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"". The word ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red"" and ""bluf"" to ""blue"" (as seen in the third input). The word ""lug"" is not repeated in the examples, but by elimination, we can infer that ""lug"" corresponds to ""red"" as well since it precedes a ""zup"" which is known to mean ""yellow"", and there are two ""red"" outputs in sequence in the third example.

Hence, the rule induction for the word ""zup"" is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

- In ""wif bluf"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is followed by ""bluf"", which outputs another ""red"".
- In ""zup bluf dax"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by ""bluf"", which outputs another ""yellow"", while ""dax"" leads to ""green"".
- In ""zup dax bluf"", the ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" and the output is a repeated ""green"".
- In ""wif zup dax bluf"", ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding ""dax"", leading to ""green"".

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
Walm appears to correspond to a rule related to the color mentioned before it, with that color being repeated three times in sequence. In each example, the word preceding ""walm"" seems to have an associated color, and the output for ""walm"" is the repetition of that color three times. The repetition appears regardless of the word following ""walm,"" which could be a single color or represent the starting of a new sequence. 

Based on the provided examples, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug
    ",Output: red blue,red blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples, regardless of the context or additional words surrounding it.
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each unique word translates to a specific color. The word 'wif' consistently translates to 'red' in every example given. Here is the breakdown of the other words:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> red

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: The nonce word 'wif' means 'red'.
Based on the provided examples, ""zup"" translates consistently to ""yellow"" in every instance it appears. There does not seem to be any dependency on context for the meaning of ""zup"" as its corresponding output is always ""yellow"", regardless of its position in the input or the other words surrounding it.

Hence, the rule can be stated as:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns in each input-output pair.

1. 'zup lug zup bluf lug' -> 'yellow blue yellow yellow blue'
Here, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', 'lug' to 'blue', and 'bluf' appears to correspond to 'yellow'.

2. 'wif bluf dax' -> 'red red green'
'wif' corresponds to 'red', 'dax' corresponds to 'green', and 'bluf' appears to correspond to 'red'.

3. 'zup bluf wif bluf' -> 'yellow yellow red red'
'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and 'bluf' seems to correspond to 'red' again.

4. 'wif dax zup wif dax bluf' -> 'red green yellow red green green'
'wif' corresponds to 'red', 'dax' to 'green', 'zup' to 'yellow'. The word 'bluf' at the end corresponds to 'green'.

5. 'wif lug zup bluf' -> 'red blue yellow yellow'
'wif' corresponds to 'red', 'lug' to 'blue', 'zup' to 'yellow', and 'bluf' once again appears to correspond to 'yellow'.

Given these examples, it's clear there is not a straightforward one-to-one correspondence between 'bluf' and a specific color. Instead, the meaning of 'bluf' appears to depend on its position or the words that are around it.

Let's look at the patterns:

- When 'bluf' follows 'zup', the color is 'yellow' (Examples 1 & 5).
- When 'bluf' follows 'wif', the color is 'red' (Examples 3 & 5).
- When 'bluf' follows 'dax', the color is 'green' (Example 4).

So, the rule seems to be that the word 'bluf' takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> The word 'bluf' takes the color of the preceding word in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine its correlation with the output colors in each example.

In Example 1, we have ""walm zup"" which results in ""green yellow.""
In Example 2, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green.""
In Example 3, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow.""
In Example 4, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow.""
In Example 5, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red.""

Observing these patterns, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the preceding color. Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the word before walm.

Rule: If [word] is followed by ""walm"", then the output color for ""walm"" will be the same as the output color for [word].

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples, regardless of the other words that follow it.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Here is how it is derived from the inputs and outputs:

- When ""dax"" is the only word in the input, the output is ""green.""
- When there are other words before ""dax"" (like ""zup lug walm wif dax""), ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
- Even when ""dax"" is not the last word (as in ""dax zup"" and ""dax wif bluf""), it still translates to ""green"" in the output.

It's also worth noting the correspondence of other words to colors might influence this deduction, but because we're solely interested in the meaning of ""dax,"" the other word-to-color mappings are not as critical for this specific rule induction.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, every occurrence of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Here is the analysis:

- ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green"" (wif -> red)
- ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" -> ""blue green green red green"" (wif -> red)
- ""wif dax"" -> ""red green"" (wif -> red)
- ""wif"" -> ""red"" (wif -> red)
- ""wif"" -> ""red"" (wif -> red)

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
From the examples provided, we can observe that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. Following this, we can establish that 'dax' corresponds to 'green', 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'. 

Now, by comparing each input with its output, let's try to deduce the meaning or rule for 'bluf':

- In the first example, 'bluf' is followed by no words, and the output is 'red red'. Since 'wif' corresponds to 'red' and 'wif' is before 'bluf', this could suggest that 'bluf' implies repeating the color before it.
- In the second example, 'bluf' follows 'dax', and the output for 'bluf' is 'green', which is the same as the color associated with 'dax'.
- In the third example, 'bluf' follows 'lug', and the output for 'bluf' is 'blue', which is the same as the color for 'lug'.
- In the fourth example, 'bluf' follows 'wif', and the output is 'red red', indicating the same repetition pattern.
- Finally, in the fifth example, 'bluf' follows 'zup', and the output is 'yellow yellow', confirming the rule that 'bluf' causes a repetition of the previous word's corresponding color.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. 'Bluf' means to repeat the color of the word immediately before it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns associated with the word's occurrence in the given examples:

1. In the first example, ""dax walm zup"" translates to ""green green green yellow."" Since ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" it appears that ""walm"" does not change the color associated with ""dax,"" as both instances translate to ""green."" 

2. In the second example, ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue blue blue green red red green."" Here we see that after ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" repeats. The word ""walm"" appears right before ""dax,"" which is translated to ""green,"" yet the coloring for ""walm"" is ""blue"" in this instance, not ""green"" like ""dax.""

3. In the third example, ""dax zup dax walm"" translates to ""green yellow green green green."" Here, ""walm"" is following ""dax"" and translates to ""green,"" which is identical to the color associated with ""dax.""

4. In the fourth example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" translated to ""blue,"" and maintains that color.

5. In the fifth example, ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" Here ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" takes on the color ""red,"" not ""yellow"" from ""zup.""

Given these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word immediately before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf
    ",Output: yellow yellow,yellow yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Most likely, lug means ""blue."" The presence of the word lug consistently maps to the word ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, where the input contains various combinations of words including ""dax"" and the output is a sequence of colors, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""dax.""

Input: dax
Output: green

This example directly correlates ""dax"" with the color green.

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

In this string, each word seems to correspond to a color. Since ""dax"" appears last and the last color is green, this supports the initial finding that ""dax"" means green.

Input: zup dax lug dax
Output: yellow green blue green

Again, ""dax"" is mapped to the color green both times it appears in the sequence.

Input: dax lug zup
Output: green blue yellow

Following the pattern, ""dax"" corresponds to the first color, which is green.

Input: dax
Output: green

This final example reaffirms the direct mapping of ""dax"" to green without any additional context.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to observe its output in various inputs and look for a pattern.

Breaking down the examples provided:

1. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow
   Here, ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and ""zup"" leads to ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green
   ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and ""walm"" also seems to be associated with ""green.""

3. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" ""walm"" leads to ""blue,"" and again ""zup"" leads to ""yellow.""

4. Input: zup wif lug dax
   Output: yellow red blue green
   ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" leads to ""green.""

5. Input: dax zup lug
   Output: green yellow blue
   ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" leads to ""blue.""

In every instance, ""zup"" consistently leads to the output ""yellow."" Thus, we can conclude that ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Observing the examples provided, each instance of the word ""bluf"" is translated into the color ""red."" Below are the examples with the colors aligned with their respective words for clarity:

Input: dax wif bluf        Output: green red red
              dax  -> green
              wif -> red
              bluf -> red

Input: zup wif bluf        Output: yellow red red
              zup -> yellow
              wif -> red
              bluf -> red

Input: lug wif lug bluf    Output: blue red blue blue
              lug -> blue
              wif -> red
              lug -> blue
              bluf -> red

Input: lug wif lug dax bluf  Output: blue red blue green green
              lug -> blue
              wif -> red
              lug -> blue
              dax -> green
              bluf -> red

Input: wif bluf lug dax wif  Output: red red blue green red
              wif -> red
              bluf -> red
              lug -> blue
              dax -> green
              wif -> red

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" in this context appears to be fairly straightforward:

Rule: bluf -> red
walm -> repetition of the last color mentioned before it, three times.

Rule: When encountering the word ""walm,"" repeat the color associated with the word directly preceding it three times. If ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" three times, as ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Similarly, if ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green"" three times, since ""dax"" corresponds to green.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In all examples provided, whenever the nonce word ""lug"" is used, the output consistently contains the color ""blue.""
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"". Each time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, the output consistently includes the word ""green"" in the corresponding position.
wif -> red

Rule: The word wif corresponds to the color red in these examples. Every occurrence of wif in the input is translated to red in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" is consistent across all examples. ""Zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" each time it appears. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, the rule for the word ""bluf"" appears to depend on the context of the words that precede it. The output color associated with ""bluf"" mirrors the output color of the word that comes right before it. This pattern holds for each example provided:

- In ""dax bluf wif,"" ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and takes on its color, green.
- In ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" then ""lug,"" and finally ""lug"" again, taking on red, blue, and blue respectively.
- In ""dax lug bluf dax,"" ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and takes on its color, blue.
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and takes on its color, red.
- In ""dax zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and takes on its color, yellow.

Rule: bluf -> The output color for ""bluf"" matches the output color of the word immediately preceding it.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" means the color of the previous word is repeated. For example, if the previous word corresponds to the color blue, ""walm"" would also correspond to the color blue.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In each example provided, whenever the word ""lug"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it appears that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"". To verify, we can see that:

- When ""dax"" appears at the beginning, middle, or end of the input, the color ""green"" is always in the corresponding position in the output.
- The output color for ""dax"" does not depend on its position or surrounding words, as it always results in ""green"" regardless of context.
- When ""dax"" is the only word in the input, the output is solely ""green"", providing a clear one-to-one association.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the meaning of ""wif"" can be consistently determined. In each instance where ""wif"" is used alone, the output is ""red."" When ""wif"" is paired with ""lug,"" the output includes ""red"" followed by ""blue."" Additionally, when ""wif"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" followed by ""red."" It seems that the word ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and its pairing with other words does not change its output but rather adds additional colors associated with the other words.

Rule: wif -> red. When ""wif"" appears in the input, the output always includes ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, zup consistently corresponds to the color yellow in the output. It doesn't seem to matter where zup appears in the input sequence; the color yellow always appears in the output. Observing this pattern, we can induce the following meaning:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> the color represented by the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"".

Rule: Repeat the color denoted by the word before ""bluf"".
walm -> meaning. Rule: walm seems to represent the color red, with the repetition of the word leading to multiple instances of ""red"" in the output. Each additional walm adds another red to the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided:

1. ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue""
2. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""
3. ""lug zup"" -> ""blue yellow""
4. ""dax zup lug"" -> ""green yellow blue""
5. ""lug walm zup walm"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow""

We see that every time the word ""lug"" appears, the word ""blue"" follows it in the output. Additionally, ""lug"" does not appear to affect the words that come before or after it other than adding ""blue"" to the sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Rule: dax -> green

This is deduced from the examples as follows:
- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
- The position of ""dax"" in the input sentence does not matter; it is always translated to ""green"" in the output, irrespective of whether it is at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of the sentence.
- No other input besides ""dax"" results in the output ""green,"" which indicates that ""dax"" uniquely maps to ""green.""
From the given examples, we can deduce that each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. Let's try to identify the pattern:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"".
- When ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow"".
- When ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"".
- When ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue"".
- In each case, the sequence of colors in the output corresponds directly to the sequence of words in the input.

So, based on these observations, the rule seems to be that each word is directly translated to a specific color. Given this pattern, we can infer the meaning of ""wif"":

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is used in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output. There is no evidence that ""zup"" is dependent on context, as it consistently translates to the same color regardless of its position or the other words present.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" is a nonce word that represents a duplication of the preceding color's name. Each example includes the word ""bluf"" immediately after a color word (""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""zup""), and the output consists of that particular color word followed by a repetition of the same color word. 

- ""lug wif bluf"": the word ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output is ""blue red red"" (the word ""wif"" is translated to the color ""red"" and ""bluf"" duplicates this color).
- ""wif bluf"": ""wif"" is translated to ""red"" and ""bluf"" duplicates the ""red"" again.
- ""zup bluf"": ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" duplicates the ""yellow"" again.
- ""lug zup bluf dax"": ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" duplicates ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" is translated as ""green.""
- Repeating the input ""wif bluf"" with the consequence of it being ""red red"" again confirms the rule.

Therefore, the rule for the word ""bluf"" is:

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the preceding color name.
Based on the examples provided, we observe that the output after the word ""walm"" is always a repetition of the color that corresponds to ""zup"" which is ""yellow"". Therefore, it can be concluded that ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the color associated with ""zup"".

Rule: walm -> repetition of the word ""yellow"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, we can deduce that ""lug"" is a stand-alone unit that does not depend on context or adjacent words to convey its meaning.

Rule:
lug -> blue
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" correlates to the color green irrespective of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" seems to translate directly to ""red."" Each example starts with the nonce word ""wif"" and the corresponding output always starts with ""red."" Also, when ""wif"" is the only word in the input, the output is solely ""red."" 

The other words in the inputs correspond to other colors as follows:
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> red
- zup -> yellow

Therefore, the rule appears to be that specific words map to specific colors. 

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"":

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" is included in the same position in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the input ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow,"" and the input ""bluf"" also corresponds to the output ""yellow."" The other inputs correspond to different colors, but ""bluf"" consistently leads to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: bluf -> yellow
Rule: The word 'walm' appears to dictate that the output is a repetition of three colors followed by a color determined by the last word. Specifically, when 'walm' is followed by 'dax', the color is green; when followed by 'wif', the color is red. The repeated color before the final color is determined by the first word: 'zup' corresponds to yellow, and 'lug' corresponds to blue.

walm -> a rule that dictates a repetition of three of a certain color based on the preceding word, followed by a different color based on the succeeding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

    ",Output: blue red,blue red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, it appears that dax corresponds to the color green, as it consistently translates to ""green"" in the output regardless of its position among other words.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red, independent of the context in which it appears.
Based on the given examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- When ""zup"" is seen alone as an input, the output is always ""yellow.""
- Whenever ""zup"" appears with another word, it also results in ""yellow,"" but the other words correspond to different colors.

Let's break it down:

1. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
   Since ""bluf"" does not result in an additional color output but simply repeats ""yellow,"" it's unclear what ""bluf"" means, but we can conclude ""zup"" means ""yellow.""

2. ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
   This reinforces the conclusion that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""

3. ""zup lug"" -> ""yellow blue""
   Here, ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" which suggests that each word following ""zup"" is translated into a color.

4. ""zup dax wif zup"" -> ""yellow green red yellow""
   In this example, ""zup"" appears twice and each time it corresponds to ""yellow."" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" This supports the idea that each word is translated to a specific color, and ""zup"" consistently means ""yellow.""
   
5. ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
   This is another confirmation that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" appears to take on the value of the color word that immediately precedes it. Here are the patterns observed:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" and the output for ""zup"" is yellow, so ""bluf"" also outputs yellow.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" and the output for ""wif"" is red, so ""bluf"" also outputs red.
- The third example is the same as the first, with ""bluf"" following ""zup"" and taking on the output of yellow.
- The fourth example follows the same pattern with ""zup"" preceding ""bluf"" and hence ""bluf"" is yellow.
- The fifth example has ""bluf"" after ""lug,"" and since the output for ""lug"" is blue, ""bluf"" also outputs blue.

So based on the given data, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it takes the color of the word that comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" takes on the same color output as the immediately preceding color word.
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word. 

Explanation: In each example, the output corresponding to ""walm"" is a repetition of the color associated with the previous word. For ""dax,"" the color is green; for ""lug,"" the color is blue, and ""wif"" maps to red. After ""walm"" is mentioned, the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" is repeated according to the instances mentioned.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of the position in the sequence or the surrounding words.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red regardless of its position in the input sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow' in every instance it appears in the provided examples.
Observing the pattern, it appears that ""bluf"" produces an output that is a repetition of the color word preceding it. Each non-bluf word corresponds to a color:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

When ""bluf"" follows a color word, the output is that color word twice. Here are the rules based on the provided examples:

- lug wif bluf -> blue red red (bluf repeats ""red"")
- dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow (bluf repeats ""yellow"")
- zup lug bluf -> yellow blue blue (bluf repeats ""blue"")
- wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow (bluf repeats ""yellow"")
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow (bluf repeats ""yellow"")

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be: 

bluf -> repeats the color word that directly precedes it in the output.
Rule: walm -> blue

This rule has been derived from observing that in each given example where the word 'walm' appears, the corresponding output is 'blue'.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

The constant output associated with the input ""dax"" across all examples is the color ""green."" Therefore, we can deduce that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Regardless of its position in the sequence, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" Observe that the presence of the word ""wif"" always leads to ""red"" in the output, independent of its location or neighboring words.

Rule:
wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" No matter its position in the input sequence, ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word. 

Explanation:
- For ""dax zup bluf,"" 'dax' corresponds to the color green and 'zup' to yellow. Following the rule, 'bluf' results in the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, hence ""green yellow yellow.""
- ""zup bluf"" gives ""yellow yellow"" since 'zup' corresponds to the color yellow and 'bluf' repeats it.
- ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"" as 'lug' is associated with the color blue, and 'bluf' duplicates that color.
- In ""dax walm wif bluf,"" 'dax' is green, 'walm' and 'wif' both appear to be associated with red; by the rule, 'bluf' causes the color of 'wif' (the word immediately preceding it) to be repeated, giving ""green green green red red.""
- ""dax bluf"" gives ""green green,"" with 'dax' being associated with green and 'bluf' repeating that color.
walm -> meaning. Meaning: Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that the word ""walm"" causes the output to be a repetition of the color associated with the previous word. Therefore, the word ""walm"" means to repeat the color that corresponds to the preceding word three times.

Rule: If a color word precedes ""walm,"" the output is the color repeated three times. For example, ""lug walm"" resulted in ""blue blue blue,"" and ""wif walm"" resulted in ""red red red.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
zup -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"". There is no variation in output corresponding to the occurrences of ""zup"", and it seems to hold this meaning regardless of the context in which it is used.

Rule: zup means yellow.
Rule: bluf -> yellow
Analyzing the provided examples, we can use the input and output sequences to determine the meaning of ""walm."" Here's a breakdown of the outputs:

- ""dax walm lug"" -> green green green blue
- ""zup wif dax walm"" -> yellow red green green green
- ""wif lug walm"" -> red blue blue blue
- ""zup walm dax lug"" -> yellow yellow yellow green blue
- ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" -> green green green red blue green green green

From the examples, we can see that every time ""walm"" appears in the input, the next color in the sequence is ""green."" The position of ""walm"" in the input sentence does not affect the output; it is always followed by ""green.""

Thus, based on these examples, the rule appears to be:
Rule: walm -> The following word is translated as ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: When the input contains the word ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
Based on the provided examples, dax consistently corresponds to the output ""green"" regardless of what precedes or follows it in the input sequence. Therefore, it appears that the word ""dax"" is being used to represent the color green.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red."" In each output, the presence of the word ""wif"" results in the appearance of the word ""red.""

Thus, the rule is:
wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow. The fact that ""zup"" is repeatedly translated to ""yellow"" regardless of its position within the series of words or the other words present suggests that its meaning is not context-dependent within the given examples. 

Therefore, the rule in this case is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" causes the output to be a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. For example:

- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow""
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red""
- ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red"", where ""wif"" is associated with red, therefore ""bluf"" causes it to repeat.

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it repeats the color associated with the previous word in the output.

Rule: bluf -> causes the color word before it to repeat in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to translate to a repetition of color names that is contingent upon the word that comes directly before it. Specifically, the color repeated three times matches the color associated with the preceding word. Here is the interpretation based on each example:

- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" translates to ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- In ""zup wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" so ""walm"" translates to ""red"" repeated three times.
- In ""zup dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" so ""walm"" translates to ""green"" repeated three times.
- In ""lug zup walm lug,"" ""zup"" (which comes before ""walm"") corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" translates to ""yellow"" repeated three times. The word ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- In ""zup lug walm wif walm,"" ""lug"" (which comes before the first ""walm"") corresponds to the color ""blue,"" so the first ""walm"" translates to ""blue"" repeated three times. ""wif"" (which comes before the second ""walm"") corresponds to ""red,"" so the second ""walm"" translates to ""red"" repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Based on the examples provided, here is the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"":

wif -> red

Rule: Every instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds with the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the correlation between the input and the output in each example.

In every instance, the output that corresponds to ""bluf"" is a repetition of the color immediately preceding it. Therefore, we can infer that ""bluf"" signifies repetition of the previous color word.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the preceding color.
Observing the patterns in the input and output examples, we can try to deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm.""

In every instance where ""walm"" appears, a sequence of red follows in the output. The number of reds corresponds with the frequency of ""walm.""

- In Example 1, ""walm lug"" results in ""red red red blue."" Considering ""lug"" might stand for ""blue,"" ""walm"" seems to cause three instances of ""red.""
- In Example 2, ""wif walm"" generates ""red red red,"" which means ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" but the sequence of three ""red"" exclusively follows ""walm.""
- In Example 3, ""zup walm dax"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow green,"" indicating ""walm"" triggers three instances of the color prior to it, ""yellow"" in this case.
- In Example 4, ""zup wif dax walm"" leads to ""yellow red green green green,"" showing ""walm"" triggers three instances of ""green,"" the color that appears right before it.
- In Example 5, ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" turns into ""green red yellow yellow red red red,"" suggesting the same rule for ""walm"" applies — it triggers a repetition of three instances of the color before it, which is ""red"" here.

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes three repetitions of the color word that immediately precedes it in the input.

Rule: walm -> Causes a repetition of three instances of the preceding color word.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word “lug” corresponds to the color blue in each of the given examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in all given examples. 

Therefore, whenever ""dax"" is mentioned, the output is ""green"". Other words (walm, wif, and zup) correspond to other colors based on their position or usage, but ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"".
Throughout the examples, each unique word appears to be associated with a specific color. For instance:

- lug correlates with blue
- bluf correlates with blue 
- zup correlates with yellow 
- walm correlates with yellow 
- dax correlates with green 

When the word ""wif"" appears, the color that follows is red. This suggests that ""wif"" likely precedes a color, changing it to red, or, more specifically, ""wif"" itself means red.

The rule for the nonce word ""wif"" can be inferred as:

wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context.
bluf -> repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: When bluf follows a word, the output color for bluf is the same as the color for the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the color outputs relative to the input words.

1. dax wif walm -> green red red red
2. zup wif lug zup walm -> yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
3. dax walm wif dax -> green green green red green
4. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
5. wif walm zup lug zup walm -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Now, let's break this into parts:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, it corresponds to ""green.""
- Whenever ""wif"" appears, it corresponds to ""red.""
- Whenever ""zup"" appears, it corresponds to ""yellow.""
- Whenever ""lug"" appears, it corresponds to ""blue.""

Now let's look at where ""walm"" appears and its corresponding colors:

- In example 1, ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" and the output colors after ""wif"" are ""red red red.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" appears at the end after two ""zup"" words, and we get ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In example 3, ""walm"" is between two ""dax"" words, and both before and after ""walm"" we see ""green green.""
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows a ""zup,"" and we have ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" appears twice following ""wif"" and ""zup,"" and both times it results in three of the color that precedes it: ""red red red"" and ""yellow yellow yellow.""

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the output of three instances of the color corresponding to the word that comes directly before it. Thus, the rule for ""walm"" could be the repetition of the color of the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> The output is the color corresponding to the previous word repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug wif zup bluf
    ",Output: red blue red yellow yellow,red blue red yellow yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug represents a color transition within a sequence, specifically to the color blue. 

In all examples, whenever lug appears, the output is blue followed by one or more color outputs that relate to the following words. It does not change color if the following word is the same as the previous (for instance, bluf dax lug bluf dax zup, where the first bluf does not change the output color but dax does).

So:

lug -> blue transition (causing the word immediately following lug to also be represented as a color)
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: Based on the examples provided, each instance of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context in which it is used.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" consistently in every example. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf -> the color word that precedes it in the sequence. If there is no preceding color word, bluf defaults to red.
walm -> repeats the color assigned to the previous word.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is used after another word, it takes on the color coding of the previous word and replicates it three times. For example, if ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is coded as green, then ""walm"" produces ""green green green."" If ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which is coded as red, it results in ""red red red.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The term ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, each time the word ""dax"" is mentioned, it corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Thus, we can induce that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"". 

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates directly to ""red."" Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding output.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". 

Therefore, the rule is: zup -> yellow.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" indicates that the color of the following word should be repeated. If there is no word following ""bluf,"" the color of the preceding word is repeated instead. If ""bluf"" is both the first and the last word, it seems to default to green.

Explanation:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf zup bluf dax,"" ""dax"" is green, so after ""bluf"" it remains green. ""Zup"" is yellow, so after the second ""bluf"" it remains yellow. The pattern finishes with ""dax"" being green again.

- In the second example, ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" is assigned the color red, and since ""bluf"" is at the end with no word after it, the color of ""wif"" is repeated.

- In the third example, ""lug wif bluf,"" ""lug"" is blue and ""wif"" is red. Because ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the color red is repeated.

- In the fourth example, ""lug wif lug dax bluf,"" the pattern of the assigned colors ""blue red blue green"" is followed up to ""dax,"" and since ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the color green is repeated.

- In the fifth example, ""zup bluf wif dax lug,"" the pattern starts with ""zup"" being yellow, and since it is immediately followed by ""bluf,"" the color yellow is repeated. Then the pattern continues with ""wif"" red, ""dax"" green, and ""lug"" blue.

So, based on these observations, the rule can be stated as:

bluf -> duplicates the color of the word it follows; if there is no subsequent word, it duplicates the color of the preceding word.
By analyzing the given examples, the rule can be figured out based on the sequence of colors that correspond to each input, especially focusing on the appearance and relative position of ""walm"" and the recurring colors around it. Here's what can be deduced:

- Every time the word ""walm"" appears, a sequence of three repeated colors follows it.
- The color that repeats three times is always the same color that immediately follows ""walm"".
- In the sequences provided, no matter what the previous or following words and colors are, the presence of ""walm"" does not change the repeating pattern of the color afterward.

Based on this information, we can infer that ""walm"" indicates repetition, specifically that the next color word should be repeated thrice. Hence, ""walm"" can be interpreted as a command or function that takes the next color word in the sequence and duplicates it two more times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the next color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" in the input translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Rule: dax -> green

The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: wif -> red

Each instance of ""wif"" in the given examples corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the input-output pairs provided, it appears that ""bluf"" is used to repeat the color word that immediately precedes it. The repetition is signaled by the use of the nonce word ""bluf,"" with the color that is to be repeated immediately before it in the sequence. The rule can be defined as follows:

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color word that comes immediately before it.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the term ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Here's how the rule is applied in each example:

- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"" since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""walm"" repeats the color.
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue"" and ""walm"" repeats it.
- ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" creates ""green green green red blue green green green."" ""walm"" repeats ""green"" after ""dax,"" then normal color association occurs with ""wif"" and ""lug,"" followed by ""walm"" repeating ""green"" after another ""dax.""
- ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" results in ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Each instance of ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it, causing ""red"" and ""yellow"" to repeat.
- ""dax lug wif walm"" leads to ""green blue red red red."" Again, ""walm"" causes the preceding color word ""wif"" (red) to repeat.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Causes the output to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in all of the given examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the relationship of the word to the inputs and outputs in each example.

1. Input: wif dax -> Output: red green
2. Input: dax walm wif walm -> Output: green green green red red red
3. Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue
4. Input: lug zup dax wif zup -> Output: blue yellow green red yellow
5. Input: dax lug zup dax -> Output: green blue yellow green

Notice that each time ""dax"" appears, ""green"" is part of the output. Also, each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. ""Dax"" does not depend on its position in the input sequence; it always corresponds to ""green."" From these examples, we can infer the following:

dax -> green

Thus, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: The word ""dax"" represents the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, whenever the input contains the word ""wif"", the corresponding output includes ""red"". Here are the examples broken down:

- Input: wif bluf dax | Output: red red green
- Input: wif | Output: red
- Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf | Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
- Input: dax bluf lug wif | Output: green green blue red
- Input: wif lug zup bluf | Output: red blue yellow yellow

In all cases, regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input or the words around it, it always translates to ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red.
The examples suggest that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. By examining how the word ""zup"" operates within different sequences, we can deduce its meaning:

1. dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue
2. zup -> yellow
3. wif dax zup wif -> red green yellow red
4. wif walm zup -> red red red yellow
5. wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> red red yellow red blue green

In every instance where ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow."" This holds true regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the corresponding color for ""zup"" is consistent across examples.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, each occurrence of the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red in the output. When ""bluf"" is present in the input, irrespective of its position, the output consistently contains red in the position where ""bluf"" is found in the input.

Rule: bluf -> red
Rule: ""walm"" -> duplicate the color word that precedes it in the input sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position in a sequence.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color that immediately precedes it in the sequence. If there is no color before ""bluf,"" it defaults to ""yellow.""

1. ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which means blue, so ""bluf"" means blue.
2. ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which means red, so ""bluf"" means red.
3. ""bluf"" is alone following ""zup"" which means yellow, so ""bluf"" means yellow.
4. ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which means yellow, so ""bluf"" means yellow.
5. ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which means red, so ""bluf"" means red.

bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" means the color that immediately precedes it; if there is no color before it, it means yellow.
Analyzing the examples given, here's what we can deduce:

Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: lug walm wif
Output: blue blue blue red

Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Looking at the outputs, we observe that walm results in a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. For instance:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green.""

In each of these cases, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated three times followed by any additional colors associated with subsequent words. Therefore, the rule for 'walm' seems to be repeating the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
dax -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, dax consistently corresponds to the color green, independent of context or position in a sequence.

Rule: dax means green.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the same position in the output.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs.

Let's examine each case:

- In the first input, ""zup wif bluf zup"", the word ""zup"" appears twice and both times it is associated with the color ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the second input, ""zup dax wif"", the word ""zup"" is again associated with ""yellow"". ""dax"" is associated with ""green"", and ""wif"" with ""red"".
- In the third input, ""dax bluf wif lug zup"", ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" at the end, consistent with previous examples.
- In the fourth input, ""zup bluf wif dax lug"", ""zup"" is once more associated with ""yellow"".
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm wif zup wif"", ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow"".

There is no variation in the color associated with ""zup"" across all examples given; ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"". Therefore, the rule we can derive from the examples is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word that precedes it. If ""lug"" means blue, then ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"". Similarly, if ""wif"" means red, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"". This pattern holds true for every color mentioned before ""bluf"".

Rule: ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color stated just before bluf.""
Based on the given examples, walm appears to correlate with a repetitive sequence of the previous word's color. In each instance, the word that precedes walm has its corresponding color repeated in the output. Here's how walm's meaning breaks down according to each example:

1. In ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and after ""walm"", the output is repeated ""yellow"".

2. In ""zup wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and after ""walm"", the output is repeated ""red"".

3. In ""wif lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and after ""walm"", the output is repeated ""blue"".

4. In ""wif walm dax zup"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and after ""walm"", the output is ""red"" repeated before it changes for the next word ""dax"".

5. In ""wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and directly following ""walm"", the color ""red"" is repeated.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that walm causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each given example.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" in the inputs consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following associations:

- 'lug' consistently translates to 'blue'
- 'dax' consistently translates to 'green'

These associations remain true whether or not the word 'wif' is present. However, regardless of what other words accompany it, when 'wif' is present, the output always begins with 'red'. 

Now, let's look at the contexts where 'wif' appears:

- 'wif' on its own produces the output 'red'
- When paired with 'lug', ‘dax’, or even 'zup', 'wif' produces 'red' followed by the associated color of the next word.
- 'dax wif', with 'wif' coming after another word, results in the other word's associated color first (green), followed by 'red'.

Observing these patterns, we can infer that 'wif' represents the color 'red', and it seems to maintain its meaning of 'red' regardless of position, with the caveat that it's always first when it is the lead word in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule for 'wif' is:

Rule: 'wif' translates to 'red'.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in every provided example, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color mentioned directly before it when the color name appears in the sequence. The examples show a direct repetition of the color word before ""bluf"". Therefore, ""bluf"" appears to mean ""repeat previous color.""

Rule:
bluf -> repeat the previous color word in the sequence.
Walm -> meaning. Rule: The word 'walm' repeats the color associated with the previous word three times. For example, 'dax' is associated with green, so 'dax walm' results in 'green green green'. If 'walm' follows 'lug', which is associated with blue, it results in 'blue blue blue', and if it follows 'zup', associated with yellow, it results in 'yellow yellow yellow'.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" It does not seem to change based on other words in the input, as it outputs ""green"" whether the input is just ""dax"" or part of a sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following pattern for the word ""wif"" and its corresponding output:

- ""wif lug"" outputs ""red blue""
- ""wif walm dax"" outputs ""red red red green""
- The sequence ""dax lug dax lug wif"" ends with ""green blue green blue red""
- ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red""

It seems whenever the word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"" followed by the colors corresponding to the words that come after ""wif"". Each word corresponds to a specific color: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red"". The word ""walm"" doesn't have a direct correlation in the given examples, but since ""wif walm dax"" results in ""red red red green"", it suggests that ""walm"" might also correspond to ""red"".

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" could be: When ""wif"" precedes other words, it outputs ""red"" and then continues to output the matching color for each subsequent nonce word.

Rule: wif -> ""red"" followed by the sequence of colors corresponding to each nonce word that follows it in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output. Each instance of ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that surround it.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Given the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" stands for the color that the word right before ""bluf"" represents. Here is the reasoning:

- In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for ""dax"" is green. ""Bluf"" also outputs green.
- In the second example, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for both ""lug"" and ""bluf"" is blue.
- In the third example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" is red.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" again, and the output for both remains red.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for both is yellow.

Therefore, based on the provided examples, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it replicates the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color of the word that comes right before it.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color that follows its preceding word. To be more specific, the word directly before ""walm"" dictates the color that will be repeated three times in the output.

For example:
1. In ""wif bluf dax walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""bluf"" to ""red"", and ""dax"" to ""green"". After ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated three times.
2. In ""wif walm zup walm"", after the first ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". After ""zup walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated three times as ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
3. In ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and after ""zup walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated three times. Then it follows the sequence for ""wif"" and ""lug"" again.
4. In ""wif dax lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", so after ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be: the output repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the provided examples.
Based on the examples provided, we observe the following:

- Input: zup lug bluf wif | Output: yellow blue blue red
- Input: zup wif | Output: yellow red
- Input: wif lug zup | Output: red blue yellow
- Input: zup wif | Output: yellow red
- Input: dax lug wif walm | Output: green blue red red red

It appears that each nonce word corresponds to a color in English. Given that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red,"" the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine the color patterns with respect to their mention in the input.

1. dax bluf wif zup dax -> green green red yellow green
2. lug zup -> blue yellow
3. lug zup -> blue yellow
4. zup dax -> yellow green
5. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green

In examples 2 and 3, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue,"" followed by ""zup"" which consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""

In example 4, ""zup"" is followed by ""dax,"" with the output colors being ""yellow green,"" where ""green"" consistently corresponds to ""dax"" from other examples.

Now, because ""zup"" appears in different positions and continues to correspond to ""yellow,"" we can deduce that the position of ""zup"" does not affect its output color.

From this pattern, it seems that the meaning of ""zup"" is context-independent and can be associated with a specific color. Based on the provided data, the rule we can induce is:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Bluf -> the word immediately following bluf is repeated in the output as the corresponding color.

Rule: If a word comes after bluf it is translated twice into its color equivalent in the output. If no word comes after bluf, it is translated once.
walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context.

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to repeat for as many times as there have been unique words since the last ""walm"" or the start of the sequence if no ""walm"" has occurred before.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" the ""walm"" occurs after two unique words, ""zup"" and ""lug,"" and since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat two additional times.
- In the second example, ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" is the only unique word before ""walm,"" so it causes ""blue"" to repeat two more times.
- In the third example, ""dax zup dax walm,"" ""dax"" and ""zup"" are the unique words before ""walm,"" and since ""dax"" is the word before ""walm,"" ""green"" repeats three times.
- In the fourth example, ""dax wif walm lug zup,"" ""dax"" and ""wif"" are the unique words before ""walm,"" leading to ""red"" repeating two times since ""wif"" is immediately before ""walm.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup,"" the first ""walm"" repeats ""red"" once as ""wif"" is the only unique word before it, and the second ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times, for ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" being the three unique words before the second ""walm.""

Observing the provided examples, where the input includes the nonce word ""dax"" and the respective output features a pattern of colors, one can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule behind ""dax.""

From the examples:
1. ""dax"" always translates to ""green"" in the output.
2. Other words (""bluf,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""walm"") correspond to their own specific colors, regardless of their position with respect to ""dax.""

Based on this information, the rule seems straightforward:

Rule: ""dax"" -> ""green.""

This means that whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, it should be replaced by the word ""green"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently correlates with the color ""red"" in the output sequence. Therefore, we can deduce that ""wif"" represents the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, there is a consistent pattern that allows us to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" Each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. For example:

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue""

In every instance where ""bluf"" appears, it corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is the same output as ""zup.""

Therefore, the rule we can derive from these examples is:

bluf -> yellow
Considering the given examples, it appears that the word walm translates to the color blue repeated three times. 

Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: walm -> three instances of the word ""blue""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds consistently to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" is presented, regardless of its position, the output includes the word ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" by looking at its position relative to other words and the corresponding colors in the output. 

From the examples:

1. When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" the output is ""green yellow.""
2. When ""dax"" is not followed by ""zup,"" the output for ""dax"" is still ""green.""
3. ""dax"" appears to carry its output color regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.

Given these points, ""dax"" seems to always correspond to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of what comes before or after it.

dax -> meaning. Rule: dax corresponds to the color ""green.""
Based on the examples given, it appears that ""wif"" correlates to the color ""red"" and other words correspond to different colors. Each occurrence of a word in the input leads to the output of its associated color. ""Zup"" correlates to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""red"" (judging by the repeated output when ""zup wif walm"" is input). The word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""green,"" as shown in the last example. Therefore, the following associations can be made:

- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""walm"" -> ""red""
- ""bluf"" -> ""green""
- ""dax"" is only mentioned once, but following the pattern, might imply ""green"" as well.

Based on these associations, the rule appears to be that each nonce word has a corresponding color as output. In each example, the word ""wif"" outputs the color ""red"":

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" can be deduced by looking at its consistent output across different contexts. In every instance where ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow"". Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
Observing the examples provided, we can extract the following information:

1. ""zup wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow red red.""
2. ""wif lug zup bluf"" corresponds to ""red blue yellow yellow.""
3. ""zup wif bluf"" (again) corresponds to ""yellow red red.""
4. ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red.""
5. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red.""

From these examples, we can infer the following patterns for colors:
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" shown by its position in example 5.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" shown by its position in example 5.

Now, let's focus on the word ""bluf."" 

From example 2, we note that the introduction of ""lug"" into the first sequence results in an extra ""blue"" before the two ""yellow"" colors, suggesting ""lug"" is directly correlated to ""blue,"" yet ""bluf"" remains represented by two ""red"" at the end.

From example 4, ""wif bluf"" is solely translated to two instances of ""red,"" showing that ""bluf"" itself results in a ""red"" color when no other color terms are introduced.

Considering all available data, ""bluf"" does not alter when it is preceded by different color names but consistently correlates to the color ""red"" each time it appears.

Based on these observations, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> ""red"" (repeated for the number of occurrences of the word ""bluf"" in the input).
Based on the examples provided, the color blue appears after every instance of ""walm"" regardless of what precedes or follows it. From this, we can deduce that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the color blue. It also seems that there might be a repetition rule involved, where the color blue is repeated for the number of times ""walm"" appears plus the number of times ""lug"" appears immediately before it.

Rule:
walm -> blue, repeated for the number of times ""lug"" appears before it plus one.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
Based on the given input-output pairs, a pattern emerges: the output is a sequence of colors that correspond to the given words. Each input word appears to map to a specific color in the output. The constant in all examples is the word ""dax"" which always maps to ""green.""

To determine the meanings of other words, we look for other consistent patterns. It seems that ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red."" The word ""bluf"" appears twice before ""green"" and once before ""red,"" which may suggest that ""bluf"" is followed by ""green"" except when followed by ""wif,"" in which case the color is ""red"" (as seen in the fourth input).

There is no instance given where ""walm"" appears directly before ""dax,"" so we cannot deduce if ""walm"" influences ""dax"" directly, but ""walm"" precedes ""blue"" twice in the last input example. However, since ""lug"" also appears before blue, without further examples, we cannot conclusively determine the rule for ""walm.""

Given the consistency of the color output in relation to ""dax,"" the rule can therefore be stated as:

Rule: The word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or other words around it.
Rule: ""wif"" indicates the start of a new color sequence. Each time ""wif"" appears, it resets the color output to ""red,"" and subsequent words determine the continuation of the color pattern until ""wif"" appears again.

wif -> ""red"" (starts a new color sequence)
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the given examples.
Based on the given examples, we can infer the following relationships between the nonce word 'bluf' and its corresponding output:

1. ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red red""
2. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
3. ""lug bluf dax bluf"" -> ""blue blue green green""
4. ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" -> ""yellow green green yellow green""
5. ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" -> ""blue green green yellow blue red""

From the examples, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a color, except for 'bluf'. Looking at the pattern, each instance of 'bluf' seems to result in a doubling of the color that immediately precedes it. 

Let's verify that:

1. blue ->blue blue (before 'bluf'), red -> red (after 'bluf')
2. green -> green green (only 'bluf' present after 'dax')
3. blue -> blue blue, green -> green (both instances of 'bluf' are followed by green)
4. yellow -> no change (no 'bluf' after yellow), green -> green green (appears after 'bluf')
5. green -> green green (after 'bluf'), yellow and blue remain unchanged (no 'bluf' after them)

Therefore, it seems that 'bluf' causes the immediate previous color to be repeated once. So 'bluf' acts as a duplicate function for the previous color.

Rule: bluf -> the word 'bluf' causes the previous color word to be output twice.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to have a repeater function. Specifically, it seems to cause the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times. Here's how the rule applies in each example:

- In the first example, ""dax"" results in a green output, and after ""walm"" is used, we see ""green"" repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""zup"" yields a yellow output, and following ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- The third example is consistent with the first; ""dax"" leads to green, ""walm"" repeats this color thrice, and ""zup"" at the end results in a single yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" leading to blue is repeated three times after each occurrence of ""walm,"" with ""zup"" in between leading to a single yellow output.
- The last example starts with ""dax,"" which is green; ""walm"" causes this green to be repeated, and then ""zup"" and ""lug"" follow suit with their associated colors (yellow and blue) without repetition.

Rule:
walm -> Causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the given examples.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word 'zup' corresponds with the output 'yellow'. We also observe that other words such as 'dax', 'lug', 'bluf', 'wif' and 'walm' correspond with different colors following some kind of rule or association that is not entirely clear from the examples given.

To formalize this:

Rule: 'zup' corresponds to the output 'yellow' regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present.

Hence, the rule induction for 'zup' is:

zup -> 'yellow'
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the correlation between the input and the output in each example:

1. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

These two examples are the same and produce a repeating color ""yellow yellow,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" echoes the color associated with the word preceding it.

3. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

This example supports the above suggestion, as ""bluf"" again echoes the color output produced by ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

4. Input: wif dax zup bluf
   Output: red green yellow yellow

Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" and in the output, ""yellow"" is repeated just like ""zup"" produces ""yellow.""

5. Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
   Output: blue red red blue red

The position of ""bluf"" after ""wif"" leads to the output of ""red red,"" again echoing the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color output of the word immediately preceding it and duplicates it.

Based on this pattern, we can write:

bluf -> ""bluf"" duplicates the color output of the word that comes directly before it.
walm -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word. Rule: The color indicated by the word immediately before ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output. 

- ""dax walm"" becomes ""green green green"" because ""dax"" associates with ""green"".
- ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"" because ""wif"" is associated with ""red"".
- In ""lug walm wif lug bluf"", ""lug"" before ""walm"" turns into ""blue blue blue"", then ""wif"" is ""red"", followed by two ""lug""s which are ""blue blue"".
- ""lug walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue"" as ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"".
- In ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"", we see ""red"" for ""wif"", ""yellow"" for both ""zup""s, ""blue"" for ""lug"", ""green"" for ""dax"", and since the last word before ""walm"" is ""zup"" (associated with ""yellow""), ""walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow yellow blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" across all provided examples.
Based on the examples provided, here is the rule for dax:

Rule: The word dax corresponds to the color green.
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the given examples, every instance of the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
bluf -> repeats the color word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: When the word bluf is used, it requires repeating of the color word mentioned just before it.
Observing the pattern from the provided examples, the rule seems to be related to repeating the color associated with the preceding word in the series. Each example has a series of nonce words (dax, zup, lug, wif) and the nonce word ""walm,"" followed by a series of colors (green, yellow, blue, red) in the output. When we see the word ""walm,"" it is followed by a repetition of the last color mentioned, repeated based on the number of times ""walm"" appears.

To deduce the rules for each nonce word:

- ""dax"" is followed by ""green""
- ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow""
- ""lug"" is followed by ""blue""
- ""wif"" is followed by ""red""

Now, let's apply this to ""walm"":

1. In the first example, ""dax zup dax walm"", ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" and the color green (associated with ""dax"") is repeated three times.
2. In the second example, ""lug wif zup wif walm"", ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and thus the color red is repeated three times.
3. In the third example, ""dax walm wif walm"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"" for the first ""walm"" resulting in two repetitions of green, then it follows ""wif"" for the last ""walm"" resulting in three repetitions of red.
4. In the fourth example, ""zup walm"", ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" so the color yellow is repeated three times.
5. In the fifth example, ""wif zup walm dax zup"", ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" repeating yellow three times, then ""zup"" follows ""dax,"" resulting in another yellow.

So the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the last mentioned color to be repeated three times. If ""walm"" is repeated in a sequence, these sets of three repeats follow sequentially for each occurrence of ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeats the last mentioned color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the given examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the patterns of colors associated with the words in each example. We note that the word ""walm"" consistently translates to the color ""green,"" and ""dax"" also consistently translates to ""green."" ""Lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

Now, let's look at the positions where ""wif"" appears and the corresponding color output:

1. When ""wif"" appears at the end of the sequence (first and second examples), the output color is ""red.""
2. When ""wif"" appears immediately after ""dax,"" the output color is ""red"" (third example).
3. When ""wif"" is at the start, the output color is ""red"" (fourth example).
4. When ""wif"" appears at the end after ""zup,"" the output color is ""red"" (fifth example).

In every example, regardless of the position of ""wif,"" the corresponding output color is ""red."" Therefore, we can conclude that:

wif -> ""red""

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at each instance it's used and identify a pattern.

1. ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow"".
2. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"".
3. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"".
4. ""wif zup dax"" translates to ""red yellow green"".
5. ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue"".

In examples 1, 3, and 4, ""zup"" is always followed by ""yellow"". In example 2, ""zup"" precedes ""yellow"" and in example 5, when ""zup"" is the first word, it also translates to ""yellow"". Throughout all examples, regardless of what comes before or after ""zup,"" it consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""

Hence, the rule appears to be that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" no matter its placement in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf means to repeat the previously mentioned color. 

Therefore, bluf -> repeat the previously mentioned color.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we must look for patterns in its occurrences and the corresponding outputs:

- When ""wif walm"" is present, the output is ""red red red.""
- ""walm wif"" results in ""red red red.""
- ""walm"" in different positions (beginning, middle, end) still results in ""red red"" being part of the output.

Now let's look for consistency in the output when ""walm"" is present:

- ""walm"" appears 5 times across the examples.
- Each time ""walm"" appears, it corresponds with ""red red red"" in the output, regardless of its position or the words around it.

Based on this, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" translates to a sequence of ""red red red"" in the output, irrespective of its position in the input.

So ""walm"" -> ""red red red"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif bluf zup lug wif
    ",Output: red red yellow blue red,red red yellow blue red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" when translated to output appears to be consistent and does not depend on context with respect to position or adjacent words. In every instance, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it is clear that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs. Every time the term ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears at the same position in the output. Therefore, the underlying rule for ""wif"" seems to be a direct translation to the color red, irrespective of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it looks like the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, there seems to be a consistent pattern in which each nonce word maps to a specific color. Let's analyze each instance where ""bluf"" appears and determine the corresponding output.

Example Analysis:

1. ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" -> ""blue green green yellow blue red""
   - Here ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" -> ""yellow red red yellow blue""
   - In this example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

3. ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" -> ""yellow yellow red blue green""
   - In this case, ""bluf"" maps to ""yellow.""

4. ""dax bluf lug wif"" -> ""green green blue red""
   - Here ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

5. ""lug bluf zup"" -> ""blue blue yellow""
   - In this example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""

From the above, it's evident that ""bluf"" does not map to a single, consistent color across the examples. However, a pattern can be discerned: ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Let's verify this rule:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" which maps to ""green"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""green.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" which maps to ""red"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" which maps to ""yellow"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" which maps to ""green"" once more, and the output for ""bluf"" is again ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" which maps to ""blue,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue.""

Rule:
bluf -> The color of the word preceding ""bluf.""
walm -> meaning. The word walm indicates the duplication or repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately follows it. 

Rule: When the word walm follows a word, the color output for that word is repeated three times. For example, when walm follows dax, the output for dax (green) is repeated three times. When walm follows lug, the output for lug (blue) is repeated three times, and so on.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax zup lug dax bluf
    ","Based on the rules provided:

1. ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
2. ""dax"" translates to ""green""
3. ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
4. ""bluf"" translates to the color of the word that precedes it.

Following these rules, let's translate the input:

- ""lug dax zup lug dax bluf""

Breakdown:
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""dax"" -> ""green""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""dax"" -> ""green""
- ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and thus takes its color -> ""green"" (since ""dax"" -> ""green"")

Now, let's create the output:

Output: blue green yellow blue green green",blue green yellow blue green green,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green,"" irrespective of its position in the input sentence. Each occurrence of ""dax"" in the input results in an occurrence of ""green"" in the output.
wif -> red

Rule: The term ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the given examples. Each time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let us look at the pattern of inputs and outputs to understand the context.

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output color associated with ""bluf"" is green.
- When ""wif"" precedes or is adjacent to ""bluf,"" the output color associated with ""bluf"" is red.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" and no ""dax"" or ""wif"" is present, the output color associated with ""bluf"" is yellow.

The output color for ""bluf"" seems to be dependent on the word that comes before it.

Based on the data, we can infer the following rule:

- If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" equals green.
- If ""wif"" is present before or after ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" equals red.
- If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" without the presence of ""dax"" or ""wif,"" then ""bluf"" equals yellow.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" changes its meaning based on the word that comes immediately before it in the sequence. If we were to summarize:

bluf -> meaning. Rule:
- ""bluf"" after ""dax"" means green.
- ""bluf"" with ""wif"" before or after means red.
- ""bluf"" after ""zup"" (and with no ""dax"" or ""wif"" impacting it) means yellow.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" induces repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
Here, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm,"" yellow is repeated twice more.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
In this case, ""wif"" relates to the color red, and after ""walm,"" red is repeated three times.

Input: dax zup walm wif walm
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
Here ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after the first ""walm,"" yellow is repeated twice more; ""wif"" represents red, and after the second ""walm,"" red is repeated three times.

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red
In this example, ""dax"" is associated with green, and after ""walm,"" green is repeated twice more.

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
And here, ""wif"" is related to red, and after ""walm,"" red is repeated two more times.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it a number of times equivalent to the position of ""walm"" within the input sequence.

So the meaning of ""walm"" can be encapsulated as:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word a number of times equal to the word's position in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" is the output.
From the given examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" correlates to a specific color in the output, but its position relative to other words seems to change the color that it corresponds to. Let's examine each instance:

1. zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   Here, dax is the third word and correlates with ""green"".

2. zup dax lug wif dax
   Output: yellow green blue red green
   ""dax"" appears twice: the second word is ""green"" and the fifth word is ""green"" again.

3. dax bluf
   Output: green green
   ""dax"" is the first word and corresponds to ""green"".

4. zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green
   ""dax"" is the third word and it's ""green"".

5. zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   ""dax"" is the seventh word and correlates with ""green"".

Given these examples, whenever ""dax"" appears, regardless of position, the output color is ""green"". Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" In every instance, regardless of the context or the words that accompany ""wif,"" the output is always ""red.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" means ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, it's possible to deduce a pattern where each word correlates to a specific color:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in every example.
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" when it follows ""zup.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" when it follows ""zup.""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" when it is either following ""dax"" or preceding ""zup.""
- ""walm"" when preceded by ""wif dax"" translates to a repetition of ""green.""

Therefore, we can conclude that ""zup"" directly translates to ""yellow,"" because regardless of its position or surrounding words (""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""lug""), the presence of ""zup"" always results in the output ""yellow"" as the first corresponding color.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
By examining the examples given, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf."" In every example, ""bluf"" translates to a color, but the specific color changes in each instance. We should look for patterns in the inputs that determine the output color.

Here's what we can notice:

1. When ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"", we get ""green green."" This suggests that ""bluf"" might mean ""green"" in this context. However, we see in other examples that ""bluf"" results in different colors. Hence ""bluf"" does not consistently mean ""green.""

2. In the examples involving ""lug wif lug bluf"" and ""zup wif bluf"", the color after ""bluf"" is the same color as the word preceding ""bluf"". ""Lug"" corresponds to blue and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

3. In the last example, we have ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"", which translates to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"", and the resulting color is blue, which is the same as ""lug"". 

Based on these patterns, it seems that ""bluf"" may refer to the color associated with the word that precedes it. That is to say, ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
walm -> repeats the color of the previous word.

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" appears after another word, it causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word the same number of times as the number of times ""walm"" occurs consecutively. For instance, one ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in two additional ""green"" in the output, two consecutive ""walm"" instances result in three additional repeats of the preceding color, and so forth.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup lug
    ",Output: green yellow blue,green yellow blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue each time it appears. In every example where ""lug"" is an input, the output consistently includes the word ""blue."" Therefore:

lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the output will contain the word ""blue.""
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds directly to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red'. Every instance of the word 'wif' in the inputs is translated to 'red' in the outputs.

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples provided, every time the nonce word ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
Based on the inputs and outputs provided, we can induce that ""bluf"" correlates with a color in the output. The color that is consistently outputted immediately after ""bluf"" is ""red."" However, when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the color outputted is ""green."" This gives us the rule that ""bluf"" normally translates to ""red"" but changes to ""green"" when preceded by ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> red, except when preceded by ""dax,"" then bluf -> green.
Rule: walm -> the color immediately preceding it in sequence repeated three times. 

For example, in ""lug zup walm lug,"" the word ""lug"" represents the color blue and is followed by ""walm."" The output for ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which is the color represented by ""zup"" preceding it repeated three times. 

Similarly, in ""zup walm,"" we see that ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" again the color for ""zup"" repeated three times. This pattern holds true for all the provided examples.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The term ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
Based on the examples provided, dax translates consistently to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green
From analyzing the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output of ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Therefore, the rule seems to be that the word ""wif"" is directly associated with the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

The given examples consistently translate ""zup"" to the word ""yellow,"" regardless of the surrounding context.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must look at the relationship between the input and the output in each example. Let's analyze each case by comparing the input word associated with ""bluf"" and the corresponding output color:

1. Input: wif bluf dax | Output: red red green
2. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug | Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
3. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf | Output: yellow green yellow green red red
4. Input: dax zup bluf | Output: green yellow yellow
5. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax | Output: green green red yellow green

Upon inspection, we can observe the following rules for the colors associated with the words other than ""bluf"":

- ""wif"" always corresponds to the color red.
- ""zup"" always corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""dax"" always corresponds to the color green.
- ""lug"" always corresponds to the color blue.

Now let's focus on where ""bluf"" appears and what happens in the output:

In the first example, ""bluf"" is between ""wif"" (which outputs red) and ""dax"" (which outputs green), and the output colors are red and green. Here ""bluf"" corresponds to a red, just like the color associated with ""wif.""

In the second example, ""bluf"" is before the second instance of ""lug"" (which outputs blue), and the output color is yellow, which is the color that corresponds with ""zup,"" the word that precedes ""bluf.""

In the third example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by nothing. The output to ""bluf"" is a red, the constant color associated with ""wif.""

In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output for ""bluf"" is yellow, consistent with the output for ""zup.""

In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif,"" both of which have output colors of green and red, respectively, but the direct output for ""bluf"" follows the output for ""dax,"" which is green.

Summarizing these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the word that immediately precedes it. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it outputs red. When it follows ""zup,"" it outputs yellow. And when it follows ""dax,"" it outputs green.

The rule, therefore, can be defined as follows:

bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" takes on the color output associated with the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.

Rule: If ""word"" is before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" outputs the color associated with ""word.""
walm -> meaning. Meaning: ""green"" when immediately following ""dax""; ""red"" otherwise.

Rule: If the word ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output for ""walm"" is ""green."" In any other context, ""walm"" corresponds to the output ""red.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" Each instance where ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of the surrounding context. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green

Meaning: ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
wif -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" seems to consistently produce the color ""red"" in the output. It does not seem to depend on the context or the second word that may follow.

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, the output will start with ""red"". If ""wif"" is the only word in the input, the output will be solely ""red"". If ""wif"" is followed by the word ""bluf"" the output will be ""red red"". If it is followed by ""lug"", the output will be ""red blue"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word zup consistently translates to the color yellow in the given examples, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it.

- In ""lug zup bluf dax,"" lug corresponds to blue, zup corresponds to yellow, and bluf repeats the color of the word before it (yellow), followed by dax, which corresponds to green.
- In ""dax bluf,"" dax corresponds to green, and bluf repeats the color green.
- In ""lug bluf,"" lug corresponds to blue, and bluf repeats the color blue.
- In ""wif bluf lug,"" wif corresponds to red, bluf repeats the color red, and then lug corresponds to blue.
- In ""dax lug bluf wif,"" dax corresponds to green, lug corresponds to blue, bluf repeats the blue, and wif corresponds to red.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

In each instance, the word ""walm"" causes the color assigned to the previous word to be repeated three times in the output. For example, when ""dax wif walm"" appears, the output after ""dax"" is ""green,"" and then after ""wif,"" it should be ""red,"" but because ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" ""red"" is repeated three times. The same pattern follows for all the examples given.

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each word is associated with a particular color in the output. Moreover, regardless of the position of the word ""zup"" in the input, it consistently correlates with the color yellow in the output. Here are the associations visible from the examples:

- dax -> green
- bluf -> yellow (assumed green in the first example due to its position after zup)
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow

The rule seems to be that each word is mapped to a specific color when translating from input to output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> the color that precedes it in the input. If there is no color before bluf, it repeats the color that follows it.
Walm -> repeats the previous color one additional time than previously repeated.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word, the output of the previous color is repeated one more time than it last appeared. For example, if the last color was said two times, with ""walm"" it would be said three times.

The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the context or the words that surround it.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word 'dax' appears in the input, it corresponds to the color 'green' in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" seems to consistently correlate with the output ""red."" There is no example where ""wif"" is associated with a different color or any other output. Thus, the rule can be deduced as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
zup -> yellow. Rule: Each instance of ""zup"" is translated to the word ""yellow"".
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color word that appears directly before ""bluf"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the provided examples. Let's break down each input with its associated output to see if we can identify any consistent rules:

1. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - Here, ""wif"" seems to correspond to the color ""red"" since ""walm"" is unknown and the output is three times ""red.""

2. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
   - In this example, ""lug"" appears followed by ""walm"" and then ""wif."" Since ""wif"" is ""red"" from the previous example, ""lug"" must be ""blue,"" suggesting that the presence of ""walm"" generates additional instances of the preceding color word.

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""Zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" and the pattern of ""wif"" producing ""red"" is consistent. Again, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color word before it, which in this case, is ""red.""

4. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   - ""Lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow"" as per previous examples. ""Dax"" seems to be a new color, ""green,"" and with ""walm"" following it, ""green"" is repeated thrice.

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - This input-output pair reinforces the previous rules regarding ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""walm.""

Considering these examples, ""walm"" consistently causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to be repeated twice more. The rule could be articulated as:

Rule: The presence of the word ""walm"" in the sequence causes the output associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" to be repeated two additional times.

Therefore the meaning of ""walm"" would be:

walm -> Repeat the preceding color word two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"". 

Rule: ""lug"" means ""blue"".
From the given examples, it appears that each word translates to a specific color. The word that corresponds to ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" Therefore, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"":

Rule: dax -> green
From examining the provided examples, it seems like the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output.

However, to create a general rule, we should consider the position of ""wif"" in the input as well as the number of times ""red"" appears in the output. In each example, ""wif"" results in a single ""red"" in the output, which suggests that the meaning of ""wif"" is not contingent on its position in the sequence or the surrounding words. Therefore, no matter where ""wif"" appears in the input or what other words are present, it translates to ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> ""red""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The term ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in this context. Each unique input word is associated with a specific color. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" When multiple words are used in combination, their corresponding colors are output in the order the words appear. ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the presence of other words.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word 'bluf' is associated with the color 'red'. Every time 'bluf' appears in an input, the output consistently contains the color red at the same position. Therefore, the rule deduced is:

bluf -> red

Rule: Whenever 'bluf' appears in the input, the corresponding output is 'red'.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" translates to repetition of the color interpretation of the word that directly precedes it. Here's how it works based on the given input/output pairs:

- In the first example, ""dax"" translates to green, and ""walm"" following ""dax"" results in ""green green green.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" translates to red, ""dax"" to green, and ""zup"" to yellow. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" we once again get a repetition of green: ""red red red green yellow.""
- In the third example, ""zup"" translates to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""lug"" to blue. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" ""blue"" is repeated: ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" translates to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""wif"" to red. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" we get a repetition of blue: ""blue blue blue yellow red.""
- In the final example, ""zup"" translates to yellow, and following it with ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue."" There are no instances where ""lug"" is followed or preceded by a different context that would alter its output. Therefore, the rule appears to be straightforward:

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green. Rule: The term ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in every example provided.
Based on the examples provided:

- When ""wif"" appears on its own or is the first word mentioned, the output is ""red"".
- When ""wif"" appears in a sequence, it outputs ""red"" regardless of its position.

From this observation, the rule seems to be that regardless of context or position, ""wif"" maps to the output ""red"". 

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the context within the series of words.
bluf -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:

Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. If the preceding word represents a color, then ""bluf"" becomes that same color.

- In ""lug bluf zup lug,"" ""lug"" represents blue, so ""bluf"" also becomes blue.
- In ""dax lug bluf,"" ""lug"" represents blue, so ""bluf"" also becomes blue.
- In ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" represents yellow, so ""bluf"" also becomes yellow.
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" represents red, so ""bluf"" also becomes red.
- In ""zup bluf lug zup,"" ""zup"" represents yellow, so the first ""bluf"" becomes yellow, and the series does not repeat a ""bluf"" after ""lug"" to verify the rule further.

Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be: ""bluf"" adopts the color of the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, we observe the following patterns:

- Whenever the word ""walm"" appears in the input, a sequence of repeated colors follows in the output.
- The color that repeats corresponds with the color immediately preceding ""walm"" in the input.
- The number of repeats of the color is three, regardless of the position of ""walm"" in the sentence.

From the examples:

1. ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"" (three reds following a ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"").
2. ""lug zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"" after a ""blue yellow"" (the ""walm"" follows a ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"").
3. ""dax wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"" after ""green red"" (the ""walm"" follows a ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"").
4. ""bluf dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"" (the ""walm"" follows a ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"").
5. ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"" (the ""walm"" follows a ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"").

With these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" causes the color word that precedes it to repeat three times in the output. Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: walm -> repeat the color represented by the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we must compare the inputs and outputs to see if there is a pattern involving the word ""dax"" that correlates with a consistent color. Each mention of the word ""dax"" in the input results in the color ""green"" in the output. The rest of the words in the inputs appear to correspond to different colors, and ""dax"" appears each time ""green"" is stated in the output. Here are the associations for the other words as well:

- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
- ""bluf"" correlates with ""green"" (but we should note that in the example ""wif dax bluf,"" ""dax"" and ""bluf"" both lead to ""green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" might sometimes also mean ""green"" or that there is an overriding rule when ""dax"" appears)
- ""walm"" has limited appearances but appears to correlate with ""green"" as well

The overriding pattern is that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. So, we can conclude:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the given outputs.
Based on the given examples, we can infer that the word ""wif"" acts as a transformation word for the word that comes directly after it. Each input word like ""dax,"" ""lug,"" or ""bluf"" has a corresponding color output (""green,"" ""blue,"" ""red,"" etc.), and when ""wif"" precedes one of those words, it changes the associated color.

Let's take a closer look at the patterns:

- ""dax"" by itself results in ""green"".
- ""wif"" before ""dax"" results in ""red green"".

- ""lug"" by itself is not shown, but ""wif"" before ""lug"" results in ""red blue"".

- ""bluf"" by itself is not shown either, but ""wif"" before ""bluf"" results in ""red red"".

From the above points, it's clear that when ""wif"" is before any word, ""red"" is added to the output before the color that word represents.

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be:

Rule: When used before a word, ""wif"" adds ""red"" to the output associated with the following word.
Based on the examples provided, each instance of zup yields ""yellow"" in the output. Thus, it seems that zup always corresponds to the word ""yellow"" regardless of the context in which it appears. Therefore, the rule can be written as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the previous word. Here is the pattern deduced from the examples:

- When ""dax"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is green followed by blue (""dax lug bluf dax"" -> ""green blue blue green"").
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is two yellows (""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"").
- When ""wif"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is two reds (""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"").
- A sequence containing ""dax zup bluf"" results in green, yellow, and two yellows, indicating that ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup"" (""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow"").
- Similarly, a sequence with ""lug wif bluf"" gives blue, red, and two reds, with ""bluf"" repeating the red from ""wif"" (""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red"").

We can then deduce that ""bluf"" replicates the color of the word that comes immediately before it. If no color is provided prior to ""bluf,"" we do not have an example, and thus we cannot deduce what the output would be in such a case.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the preceding word.
To figure out the rule, let's look at the instances when ""walm"" appears and the corresponding output:

1. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
2. ""zup lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
3. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
4. ""dax walm wif bluf"" -> ""green green green red red""
5. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""

In each output set, ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color word equivalent to the nonce word that appears immediately before ""walm."" Here is the breakdown:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" is not directly followed by ""walm,"" but it corresponds to ""red""

Every time ""walm"" appears, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated one additional time. For example, ""dax lug walm"" resulted in ""green blue blue blue"" (with ""blue"" being repeated due to ""lug"").

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word one more time.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Every occurrence of the word ""dax"" in the input results in the word ""green"" in the output.
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can induce that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each instance of ""zup"" in the provided inputs yields ""yellow"" in the same position in the outputs.

- In the first example, ""zup"" appears twice, and the output contains ""yellow"" twice in the corresponding positions.
- In the second example, ""zup"" appears once, and there's one ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in a two-word and a two-word sequence, respectively.
- The fifth example also supports this rule, showing ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"" in a three-word sequence.

Therefore, the induction rule is:

zup -> ""yellow""
Observing the examples provided, we can see that ""bluf"" seems to correspond to a repeat of the color that is associated with the word preceding it. 

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green,"" which means ""bluf"" assumes the color of ""dax,"" which is green.
- Similarly, in the second, third, and fifth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug,"" respectively, and the output for ""bluf"" each time is the same as the word before it: ""yellow,"" ""red,"" and ""blue.""

Therefore, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"":

bluf -> the same color as the preceding word.
Rule: If a word is followed by ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" takes the color attributed to the preceding word.
From the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color word that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it.

1. ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue,"" which means ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue and ""walm"" prompts it to be said three times.
2. ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and again, ""walm"" results in the color being repeated three times.
3. ""dax walm zup lug"" outputs ""green green green yellow blue."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""lug"" to blue. Following the established rule, ""dax walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times, while ""zup"" and ""lug"" are not affected by ""walm"" as they follow it, thus are mentioned only once.
4. The repetition of ""zup walm"" with the same output as the previous instance, ""yellow yellow yellow,"" serves to confirm the pattern.
5. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue green blue blue blue."" ""Dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" to blue, and ""walm"" applied to ""lug"" multiplies the occurrence of ""blue"" by three.

Based on the above analysis, the meaning of ""walm"" is that it causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. 

Hence, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red."" Therefore, we can deduce that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow. The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in all provided examples.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color 'red' when it follows ""zup"" or ""wif"", and it corresponds to the color 'green' when it follows ""lug"" or ""dax"". The word that comes before ""bluf"" determines its meaning:

- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow red""
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red""
- ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue green""
- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green""

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes the color that the previous word represents when that color follows a certain pattern in the sequence. This pattern seems to be:

- If preceded by ""zup"" or ""wif"" (which output ""yellow"" and ""red"", respectively), ""bluf"" means ""red.""
- If preceded by ""lug"" or ""dax"" (which output ""blue"" and ""green"", respectively), ""bluf"" means ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> ""red"" when preceded by a word that translates to ""yellow"" or ""red""; ""green"" when preceded by a word that translates to ""blue"" or ""green"".
walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a series of the color associated with the preceding word repeated three times.

Rule: ""walm"" appears to be a modifier that repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times. If there is no word before ""walm"" that can be clearly associated with a color, it does not produce an output.

Examples to rules application:

1. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue"": Here, ""lug"" is associated with blue, therefore ""walm"" causes the output to repeat blue three times after the initial blue.

2. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue"": ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with blue, resulting in three blue outputs.

3. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"": ""zup"" is associated with yellow and it's directly before ""walm"", causing a triple yellow output.

4. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" -> ""blue red yellow red red red"": Here, ""wif"" is the word right before ""walm"" and is associated with red, so ""walm"" results in red being outputted three times after ""red.""

5. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red"": After the initial ""zup walm"" sequence which results in three yellows, the pattern continues with the next color associations without ""walm"" until the end where ""wif"" is associated with red but does not have a ""walm"" following it, thus it's a single red output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color blue.
dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red"". Each instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the respective position in the output. So the rule appears to be quite simple in this context.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
Bluf -> yellow. Rule: Every instance of ""bluf"" in the input is translated to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the term ""walm"" appears to be a rule that applies a specific color output to the word that precedes it. Here's how we can analyze it:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green,"" which implies that ""walm"" might be a rule that repeats the color associated with the word before it (""dax"" in this case) three times.

- The second example, ""wif lug dax walm,"" outputs ""red blue green green green,"" which supports the idea that 'walm' repeats the color of the preceding word (in this case ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"") three times.

- The third example, ""lug wif dax zup walm,"" outputs ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow,"" which further supports the rule, as ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

- The fourth example, ""dax lug walm zup wif,"" outputs ""green blue blue blue yellow red,"" which fits the rule as well, with ""lug"" preceding ""walm"" and its associated color ""blue"" being repeated three times.

- In the fifth example, ""dax walm zup,"" outputs ""green green green yellow."" It aligns with the rule as ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the color ""green"" associated with ""dax"" is repeated three times. The color ""yellow"" is for ""zup,"" which appears after ""walm"" and is not influenced by the ""walm"" rule.

By analyzing these patterns, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" 

Every time ""dax"" is presented in the input, the word ""green"" is added to the output. This pattern is consistent across all examples. The word following ""dax"" does not appear to affect this translation as ""dax"" is followed by different words in the examples (e.g., ""wif,"" ""walm,"" ""zup""), but the output is consistently ""green"" regardless of the following word. 

""dax"" -> green

Rule: When the word ""dax"" is in the input, the color ""green"" is in the output at the corresponding position.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" can be defined as:

zup -> meaning: yellow

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, it is translated to ""yellow"" in the output.
bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the correspondence of inputs and outputs:

1. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"" - It appears that both the word ""dax"" and ""walm"" correlate with the color green.
   
2. ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow"" - We can see that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and both occurrences of ""walm"" translate to ""red."" The word ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""

3. ""wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""red blue green green green"" - In this example, ""wif"" is to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""walm"" follows as ""green.""

4. ""lug walm wif lug"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue"" - Here, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" ""walm"" with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" with ""red.""

5. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"" - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm,"" when following ""zup,"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

From these examples, we see that ""walm"" does not have a consistent single color output. However, it has a consistent pattern: the color ""walm"" corresponds to always repeats the color that directly preceded it.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color word that comes immediately before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue."" Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, every instance of the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds directly to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present.
wif -> red

Rule: Every instance of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" translates consistently to the color yellow. There isn't enough information to determine if there are additional contextual dependencies for the meaning of ""zup,"" as it consistently translates to yellow regardless of its position in the input string or the surrounding words. Thus, the rule is:

zup -> yellow. 

Rule: ""zup"" means yellow, independent of context in the given examples.
Rule: bluf -> red when following wif and yellow when following zup or lug.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" affects the output by repeating the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it three times. Specifically, the color associated with the word that comes before ""walm"" is repeated thrice in the output.

For example:

- In ""lug wif dax zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In ""lug wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so the output is ""red red red.""
- In ""zup lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so the output is ""blue blue blue.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it takes the color associated with the word immediately before it and repeats it three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently maps to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples.
Given the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Every instance where ""dax"" is mentioned, the word ""green"" is included in the output. The frequency of ""green"" in the output also matches the frequency of ""dax"" in its respective input. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green

Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" dictates a color output according to the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red

Each instance of the word ""wif"" in the inputs corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs, regardless of its position or the other words present.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in all given examples, irrespective of what other words it is combined with.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to represent the color associated with the word that precedes it. Each given word when followed by ""bluf"" produces an output with the preceding word's associated color twice.

Here is the breakdown:

1. lug bluf -> blue blue (Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", it results in ""blue blue"".)

2. wif bluf lug -> red red blue (Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", it results in ""red red"", and then ""lug"" translates into ""blue"".)

3. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow (Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", it results in ""green green"", and ""zup"" translates into ""yellow"".)

4. lug wif bluf lug wif -> blue red red blue red (The sequence follows the same translation, with ""bluf"" making the preceding word's color appear twice.)

5. dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue (Similarly, ""bluf"" doubles the preceding color which is ""red"" from ""wif"", and the others are translated accordingly.)

Rule: bluf -> The word immediately preceding ""bluf"" is translated into its corresponding color, and the output is that color written twice.
To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the relationship between input and output in each example.

In the first example:

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

The correspondence seems to be:
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red

In this sequence, ""walm"" is followed by three yellow outputs in a row.

In the second example:

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red

The correspondence here appears to be:
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red

Here, ""walm"" similarly correlates with three red outputs.

In the third example:

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Here it appears:
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

Again, ""walm"" seems to produce three blue outputs.

In the fourth example, the inputs and corresponding outputs before ""walm"" hold the same pattern. After ""walm,"" there are three red outputs in a row, but the sequence is followed by one blue and one yellow unrelated to the pattern of ""walm.""

In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by three green outputs in a row.

From this analysis, one can infer that ""walm"" makes the next color repeat three times. The repeated color is the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Thus, we can represent the rule as:

walm -> The color corresponding to the word right before ""walm"" is repeated three times.

Rule: If X represents the word before ""walm,"" and Y represents the corresponding color for X, then ""walm"" causes the next three outputs to be Y.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can observe a pattern that correlates each occurrence of the nonce word ""dax"" with the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> meaning. Given the examples provided, ""wif"" consistently translates into the color ""red."" 

Rule: wif -> red.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""zup,"" let's closely examine the correspondence between the inputs and outputs in each example, particularly the position of ""zup"" and the color that comes up in the output.

- In all cases where ""zup"" appears, the output color is ""yellow"".
- The appearance of ""zup"" does not seem to affect the color output for other words like ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" or ""bluf,"" which are consistently associated with their respective colors regardless of ""zup"" placement.

Based on these observations, it looks like ""zup"" is consistently translated to the color ""yellow"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: ""Zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Rule: ""bluf"" appears to correspond to the color ""blue,"" except when it follows the word ""dax,"" in which case it corresponds to the color ""green.""
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's examine the pattern of colors associated with each instance of ""walm"" in the given examples:

1. In the first example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" which suggests that ""walm"" by itself could be associated with the color red repeated three times.
2. The second example supports this idea, with ""wif walm"" again translating to ""red red red.""
3. The third example reinforces the pattern, with ""wif walm"" continuing to correlate with ""red red red.""
4. In the fourth example, when ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug zup walm,"" the output is ""blue yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting a deviation from the previously established pattern. However, we can see that ""zup walm"" in this instance accounts for ""yellow yellow yellow,"" pointing toward ""walm"" still being associated with three of the same color.
5. In the fifth example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" which is consistent with the idea that ""walm"" produces three of the same color as the word just prior to it.

Based on these observations, we can establish a rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times.

For example, in ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" is associated with red, so ""walm"" causes the output ""red red red."" In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" is associated with green, so ""walm"" results in ""green green green.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Input: dax wif zup bluf
    ",Output: green red yellow blue,green red yellow yellow,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following correlations between the inputs and outputs:

- Whenever the input contains ""lug,"" the corresponding output includes ""blue.""
- The word ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""
- The word ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""
- The word ""dax"" correlates with ""green.""
- The order of the words in the input corresponds to the order of the colors in the output.

From these observations, we induce the following rule:

lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green"".
wif -> meaning. The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" is presented in the input, it is translated to the color ""red"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string. Here's how that conclusion is reached:

- In the first example, ""walm"" appears to mean ""yellow,"" because ""walm lug"" yields ""yellow blue,"" and ""lug"" yields ""blue"" in the fifth example. Since ""zup"" also results in ""yellow"" in the output, ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow.""
  
- The second example again shows ""zup"" eliciting a ""yellow"" response in the output.

- The third example includes ""zup"" between two ""wif"" and ""dax"" words, which correspond to ""red"" and ""green,"" respectively. Here again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

- The fourth example contains ""zup"" at the end, and the color sequence includes ""yellow"" at the end, aligning with previous observations.

- The fifth example merely confirms that when ""lug"" is followed by ""zup,"" the colors blue and yellow are the output.

From these observations, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at each example to identify a pattern.

Input: dax bluf wif
Output: green green red
- Here, dax corresponds to green and wif corresponds to red. ""bluf"" also corresponds to green, but we need more examples to confirm whether ""bluf"" always corresponds to green or not.

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
- In this example, lug corresponds to blue, and wif to red as before. ""walm"" is not found in previous examples, but ""walm"" corresponds to blue here. ""bluf"" appears at the end, and again it corresponds to blue, not green. This suggests that ""bluf"" does not always correspond to green.

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow
- Following previous patterns, wif is red, lug is blue, and zup is a new word which corresponds to yellow. Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to red, which differs from the previous outputs.

Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
- Following patterns, zup is yellow, dax is green, and lug is blue. ""bluf"" corresponds to blue when following zup and to green when following lug, indicating that ""bluf"" might take on the color following it.

Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
Output: blue red red blue red
- Previous patterns hold, and ""bluf"" follows wif which is red, but the output is blue, which matches the color ""bluf"" is followed by (lug).

From these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that follows it. If ""bluf"" is the last word, it repeats the color of the word just before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word that follows it. If ""bluf"" is at the end, it takes the color of the word just before it.
From the given examples, we can induce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" By examining the outputs for each instance of ""walm,"" it appears that ""walm"" influences the color repetition in the sequence. Notice how in each output sequence, the color before ""walm"" is always repeated an additional two times after ""walm"" is encountered. This suggests that ""walm"" represents a rule to repeat the color that immediately precedes it two more times.

We can test this rule with each example given:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" indicating ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" which means ""walm"" repeats ""red"" twice after ""wif.""
- In the third example, ""lug walm"" again results in ""blue blue blue,"" supporting the repetition rule.
- The fourth example is slightly trickier because ""lug walm"" is followed by additional colors, but ""walm"" still causes ""blue"" to repeat two more times before continuing with the pattern.
- Finally, the fifth example ""dax walm zup"" results in ""green green green yellow,"" confirming that ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""green"" twice after ""dax.""

Therefore, we can conclude the rule that ""walm"" repeats the color that immediately precedes it two more times. 

Rule: walm -> causes the color immediately before it to be repeated two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In all provided examples, the word ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, ""lug"" means ""blue.""
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" In each example, whenever the word ""wif"" is used, it corresponds to the output ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:
wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" reflects the color that numerically precedes it. Here is the rule derived from the examples:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output color for ""bluf"" is red, which is the same as the output color for ""wif.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output color for ""bluf"" is yellow, which is the same as the output color for ""zup.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output color for ""bluf"" is green, which is the same as the output color for ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word. If ""bluf"" is the first word or does not have a preceding color-associated word, the rule for its color is not defined in the provided examples.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word
Based on the input-output pairs, we can observe a pattern that applies to the word ""walm"". Let's analyze:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the corresponding output sequence contains a consecutive repetition of the color that precedes ""walm"". For example, if ""lug"" (which translates to blue) precedes ""walm"", the output is multiple consecutive ""blue"".
- The repetition stops when a new input word is introduced that changes the color, such as ""wif"" changing to red or ""dax"" changing to green.
- The number of times the color repeats seems to be exactly three, regardless of how many times the word ""lug"" (for instance) repeats before ""walm"".

Let's apply this rule to ""walm"":

Input: wif walm lug bluf
- ""wif"" translates to red.
- ""walm"" follows ""wif"", so the output repeats ""red"" three times.
- ""lug"" translates to blue and ""bluf"" doesn't change the color since it's not a recognized word, so it defaults to blue.

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
- ""lug"" translates to blue.
- ""walm"" follows ""lug"", so the output repeats ""blue"" three times.
- ""dax"" changes the color to green.
- The sequence of ""wif"", ""lug"", ""wif"" continues with the appropriate color translations.

Input: dax lug walm
- ""dax"" translates to green.
- ""lug"" changes the color to blue.
- ""walm"" follows ""lug"", so the output repeats ""blue"" three times.

Input: dax walm zup
- ""dax"" translates to green.
- ""walm"" follows ""dax"", so the output repeats ""green"" three times.
- ""zup"" changes the color to yellow.

Input: lug walm wif zup wif
- ""lug"" translates to blue.
- ""walm"" follows ""lug"", so the output repeats ""blue"" three times.
- ""wif"" changes the color to red and ""zup"" changes it to yellow.

Rule:
walm -> The output color is repeated three times, matching the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sentence.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. To confirm this, we can look at the position of ""wif"" in each input and the color that appears in the corresponding position in the output:

- In the first input, ""wif"" is the second word, and in the output, the second color is red.
- In the second input, ""wif"" is the third word, and in the output, the third color is red.
- In the third input, ""wif"" is the third word, and in the output, the third color is red.
- In the fourth input, ""wif"" is the fourth word, and in the output, the fourth color is red.
- In the fifth input, ""wif"" appears twice, in the third and sixth positions, and correspondingly in the output, the third and sixth colors are red.

Confirming this pattern across all examples, we can deduce the meaning:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow in the given examples, regardless of context or position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can observe that each time ""bluf"" appears, it corresponds to ""red red"" in the output. Thus, it seems like ""bluf"" translates to ""red red"" regardless of its position in the input:

Rule: bluf -> red red
Walm -> three repeats of the color word that comes before it.

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" follows a color word, it translates into that color word being repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in a sequence. Here are the mappings from the examples:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- bluf -> blue (Since ""lug"" already maps to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" seems to be redundant or possibly a mistake in the input.)

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> meaning. Meaning: ""green""

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". It can be placed either before or after another color word, and when it stands alone, it still represents the color ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in an input, the corresponding output is ""yellow.""
Based on the given examples, we can induce a rule for what ""bluf"" means. In each instance, ""bluf"" translates to the color immediately preceding it:

1. In ""lug wif lug bluf,"" ""lug"" is blue, so ""bluf"" means blue (blue red blue blue).
2. In ""wif lug bluf,"" ""lug"" is blue, so ""bluf"" means blue (red blue blue).
3. In ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax,"" right before ""bluf"" comes ""wif"", which is red, so ""bluf"" means red (green blue blue blue green red red green).
4. In ""dax bluf zup,"" ""dax"" is green, so ""bluf"" means green (green green yellow).
5. In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" is red, so ""bluf"" means red (red red).

Rule: bluf -> The color it takes is the same as the color word immediately preceding it within the given input.
Analyzing the examples provided:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
2. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red
3. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
4. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

From these examples, we observe that whenever the word ""walm"" appears, the following color sequence is identical to the one just prior to ""walm"":

1. In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the output color for ""wif"" is red. Directly following ""walm,"" we observe the output color sequence to be red again.
   
2. In the second example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and has the output color of red. Following ""walm,"" we again see the color red repeated thrice, mirroring the output for ""wif"" which occurs three times just before ""walm.""

3. In the third example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" with the output color of blue. After ""walm,"" we see blue repeated, matching the output color of ""lug.""

4. In the fourth example, ""lug"" is the word before ""walm"" with the output color of blue. Following ""walm,"" the color blue appears, consistent with the ""lug"" color output.

5. In the fifth example, ""zup"" comes before ""walm"" with the color yellow in the output. Subsequent to ""walm,"" the output color is yellow repeated twice.

Hence, ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition in the output of the color corresponding to the word just before it.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color output of the preceding word

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow,yellow yellow yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue."" Other words such as ""zup"" and ""wif bluf"" seem to correspond to ""yellow"" and ""red red"" respectively, but since the question specifically asks about the meaning of ""lug,"" we can conclude:

lug -> meaning. Rule: lug means ""blue"".
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, wif consistently translates to red in the output. Hence, the rule is straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" can be determined as follows:

- In Example 1, ""zup"" is the first word and translates to ""yellow"".
- In Example 2, ""zup"" alternates with ""dax"" and translates to ""yellow"" while ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
- In Example 3, ""zup"" is the last word and translates to ""yellow"".
- In Example 4, ""zup"" appears first and third in the sequence, always translating to ""yellow"".
- In Example 5, ""zup"" is the last word and translates to ""yellow"".

From the above examples, it is evident that irrespective of its position in the sequence, ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided examples, the following rule appears to apply to the nonce word ""bluf"":

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""yellow.""

Therefore:

bluf -> yellow.
Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be related to repeating the color associated with the immediately preceding word in the output sequence. To verify this, let's analyze each example:

1. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
2. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
3. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red

In each case, the word preceding ""walm"" is transformed to its color equivalent (as seen in other portions of the output), and then that color is repeated three times following the ""walm"" translation.

To understand the rule, let's look at each instance:

- In the first input, ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" and following ""walm,"" we have ""red"" repeated three times.
- In the second input, ""wif"" maps to ""red"", and after ""walm,"" we once again have ""red"" repeated three times (followed by ""lug,"" which maps to ""blue"").
- In the third input, ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" we have ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- In the fourth input, ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" and following ""walm,"" we have ""green"" repeated three times.
- In the fifth input, the pattern repeats with ""wif"" mapping to ""red"" followed by ""red"" repeated three times after ""walm.""

Given this consistent pattern, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" results in the color associated with the prior word in the sequence being repeated three times.

Thus, the meaning of ""walm"" is:

walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug
    ",Output: green blue,green blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"" by finding patterns in the input and corresponding output. Let's analyze the examples:

1. ""wif dax wif"" translates to ""red green red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
2. ""dax zup"" translates to ""green yellow,"" which supports the idea that ""dax"" means ""green"" and implies ""zup"" might mean ""yellow.""
3. ""dax"" on its own translates to ""green,"" further supporting the notion that ""dax"" means ""green.""
4. ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow red green green,"" consistently showing ""wif"" as ""red,"" ""dax"" as ""green,"" and ""zup"" as ""yellow."" The new word ""bluf"" appears to translate to ""green.""
5. ""zup dax walm"" translates to ""yellow green green green,"" which is aligned with the earlier association of ""zup"" with ""yellow"" and ""dax"" with ""green."" However, it introduces ""walm,"" which is also represented by ""green.""

Considering all the examples, we can conclude the following:

dax -> green

And so, the rule is:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

- In every instance the word ""wif"" is used, the output is ""red"".
- ""wif"" does not seem to modify or change based on its position in the input sequence.
- There is no variation in the output; no matter the surrounding words, ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red"".

From this, we can conclude the rule for ""wif"" is straightforward:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position or the context in which it is used.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position in the sequence.
bluf -> repeat the color word preceding it.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a color word, it instructs to repeat that color word.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times in the output. In the examples, the output color triples whenever the nonce word ""walm"" follows another word. Here is the breakdown of examples correlating with the rule:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green.""
- In the second, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""
- In the third, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red.""
- In the fourth, ""wif walm"" once again leads to ""red red red.""
- And in the last example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" while ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue.""

With this pattern, we can deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
Rule: dax -> green. The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the given examples.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" can be defined as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> repeat the last color mentioned.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let us look at the repeating patterns in each line of examples and their corresponding outputs:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the word immediately following ""walm"" is translated into ""green"" in the output, while ""walm"" itself is also translated to ""green.""
- If the word following ""walm"" appears twice before in that input (like ""dax"" in the second example), the second occurrence is still ""green"" followed by the color corresponding to that word (""blue"" in this case for ""dax"").
- When a word appears after ""walm"" for the first time, it is translated to ""green.""
- The words ""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" consistently have outputs of ""red,"" ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue,"" respectively, after the first instance of ""green"" caused by the presence of ""walm.""

These observations suggest that the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it triggers the word that follows it to be ""green,"" as well as itself being ""green,"" regardless of what the word normally translates to.

Rule: walm -> makes the following word and itself translate to ""green.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer that ""dax"" consistently correlates with the output ""green."" There are no instances where ""dax"" leads to a different output. Therefore, we can deduce the meaning as follows:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided. Here are the examples with their respective outputs:

Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
Input: wif lug dax walm -> Output: red blue green green green
Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
Input: wif -> Output: red

From the outputs, we can surmise that every time the word ""wif"" appears, the output includes at least one instance of the color ""red."" In cases where ""wif"" appears without any additional words, the output is solely ""red."" Therefore, it suggests that ""wif"" alone corresponds to the color ""red."" Furthermore, no other inputs without ""wif"" are provided to contradict this observation.

Based on this information, the most straightforward rule we can induce is:

Rule: wif -> red

This means that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color following the word ""bluf."" To confirm this, let's look at each example:

1. wif zup dax bluf -> red yellow green green
2. wif zup bluf lug -> red yellow yellow blue
3. dax bluf wif zup wif -> green green red yellow red
4. lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> blue blue red blue blue yellow
5. dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red

In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by a color that is repeated (""green""), hence bluf could be green. 

In the second example, ""bluf"" again precedes the color ""yellow,"" which is repeated, so the rule seems consistent.

In the third example, ""bluf"" comes before ""red"" which is also the next repeated color in the sequence, confirming the pattern so far.

The fourth example presents ""bluf"" before a ""blue"" and again is followed by the color ""blue,"" further corroborating the rule.

In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""red,"" which becomes the next color in the sequence, consistent with the observations from previous examples.

Rule: bluf -> the color that is immediately repeated after it appears. For instance, if ""bluf"" is followed by ""red"" and the next color is also ""red,"" then bluf would mean ""red"" in that context.
To induce the rule, let's examine the outputs associated with the use of ""walm"" in various contexts:

1. When ""walm"" is used after ""wif"": the output is three instances of the color associated with the previous word, which is ""red"" in this context.
2. When ""walm"" is used after ""lug"": the output is three instances of the color associated with ""lug"", which is ""blue"".
3. When ""walm"" is used after ""dax"": the output is three instances of the color associated with ""dax"", which is ""green"".
4. When ""walm"" is used after a sequence of words (""wif lug dax walm""): the output repeats the last color three times, which in this case is ""green"".
5. When ""walm"" is used before a word (""wif walm zup""): the output is three instances of the color preceding ""walm"" followed by the color associated with the word after ""walm"".

From the observed patterns, ""walm"" seems to cause the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word triple times, regardless of its position relative to the other words:

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the input and output examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" No matter the context or the position of ""zup"" in the sequence, the output is always ""yellow."" Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a word, the output is the color associated with the preceding word repeated twice. For example, when ""dax"" (which corresponds to the color green) is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green."" This rule holds true in each example with the appropriate color repetition for each word preceding ""bluf.""
Observing the examples provided, we can infer that the word ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red red red,"" the word ""dax"" in ""green,"" ""lug"" in ""blue,"" and ""zup"" in ""yellow."" When ""walm"" is present, it seems to be associated with the repetition of the color that comes immediately after it in the output. 

Therefore, the rule seems to be: the nonce word ""walm"" causes the next color word in the output sequence to be repeated twice, effectively tripling the color's occurrence.

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
dax -> meaning. Based on the given examples, dax consistently corresponds to the output color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word (lug, dax, bluf, zup, wif) corresponds to a color:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- bluf -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red

Looking at the inputs and corresponding outputs:

- ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red"".
- Every instance of ""wif"" in the examples translates to ""red"".

Thus, the rule seems straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow' regardless of its position in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the input and output pairs and look for patterns:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output is ""green"".
2. Whenever ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output is ""red"".
3. Whenever ""zup"" appears, the corresponding output is ""yellow"".
4. Whenever ""lug"" appears, the corresponding output is ""blue"".
5. ""bluf"" does not correspond to a consistent color output, but is always followed by or precedes another color in the sequence.

Now, let's look at the contexts in which ""bluf"" appears:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by two yellows, despite different words preceding it. 
- In the second and fifth examples, ""bluf"" is followed by two reds in the second and two blues in the fifth.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by a yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by a red and precedes a green.

These observations suggest that ""bluf"" causes the color that follows or precedes it to be repeated once. It may be analogous to a command to duplicate the subsequent or preceding color in the sequence.

Considering this, let's phrase the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" duplicates the color that immediately follows or precedes it in the output sequence.

Therefore:

bluf -> repeat the color that comes after or before.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that 'walm' results in a repetition of the color related to the previous word in the sequence. Here is the pattern:

- Example 1: ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""green red yellow yellow red red red"". The word 'walm' follows 'wif', which corresponds to red. Thus, 'walm' results in additional reds.
- Example 2: ""lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". The word 'walm' follows 'zup', which corresponds to yellow. Thus, 'walm' results in additional yellows.
- Example 3: ""dax walm zup"" results in ""green green green yellow"". The word 'walm' follows 'dax', which corresponds to green. Thus, 'walm' results in additional greens.
- Example 4: ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" results in ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"". The word 'walm' follows 'zup', which corresponds to yellow. Thus, 'walm' results in additional yellows.
- Example 5: ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". The word 'walm' follows 'zup', which corresponds to yellow. Thus, 'walm' results in additional yellows.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color corresponding to the previous word in the sequence.

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
By comparing each input with the corresponding output, we can attempt to infer the meaning of the word ""wif."" Let's examine each pair of input and output.

Input: zup dax wif zup
Output: yellow green red yellow
Rule: zup corresponds to yellow, dax corresponds to green, and given the placement, wif could correspond to red.

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow
Rule: Again, zup corresponds to yellow and wif to red.

Input: dax zup walm wif walm
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
Rule: Again dax corresponds to green, zup corresponds to yellow, and wif to red. Since 'walm' doesn't have a direct translation but results in ""yellow red,"" it could be that 'walm' causes a repetition of the previous colors in reverse order (""yellow red"").

Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
Rule: Here, wif corresponds to red, zup to yellow, lug to blue, and dax to green. The appearance of wif results in red, zup in yellow following it, and so forth. 'Walm' again results in yellow following it, as seen in the previous pattern from the last input.

Input: dax lug wif
Output: green blue red
Rule: As before, dax corresponds to green and lug to blue; wif again corresponds to red.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be consistently that:

wif -> red

Hence, ""wif"" can be deduced to mean the color ""red.""
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output in the corresponding position.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red in the given examples, regardless of the context it appears in.
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the rule is:

Rule: lug translates to the color blue.
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. In every instance where ""zup"" is used, the output includes the word ""yellow"" at the position corresponding to where ""zup"" is in the input.
bluf -> repeating the color of the word that follows it. Rule: When ""bluf"" is presented after a word, the output repeats the color that corresponds to the word that comes immediately after ""bluf."" If there is no word after ""bluf,"" there is no repeated color.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Let's analyze the provided data:

1. In the first input ""lug zup walm lug,"" ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow."" The sequence ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" is a repeat of ""zup's"" color. Then, the sequence ""walm lug"" produces ""yellow blue,"" maintaining ""lug's"" association with ""blue.""

2. In the second input ""dax walm wif,"" ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and ""wif"" with ""red."" Since the sequence ""dax walm"" results in ""green green,"" it again suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"" which is ""green.""

3. In the third input ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif,"" the sequence ""wif walm,"" translates to ""red red,"" confirming that ""walm"" repeats ""wif's"" color. The sequence ""walm lug"" translates to ""red blue.""

4. In the fourth input ""dax walm zup lug,"" the sequence ""dax walm"" transforms into ""green green,"" consistent with ""walm"" repeating the color of ""dax.""

5. In the fifth input ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" the sequence ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue,"" upholding the rule that ""walm"" repeats ""lug's"" color.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be to repeat the color of the word that directly precedes it.

Rule: walm repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""dax"" seems to be associated with a specific color. We can understand the meaning of ""dax"" by comparing the inputs to their corresponding outputs.

From the first example:
- Input: wif dax wif
- Output: red green red

This suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

From the second example:
- Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
- Output: blue red blue green green

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""dax"" still appears to correspond to ""green"". ""bluf"" may correspond to ""green"" as well, given the double ""green"" at the end of the output.

From the third example:
- Input: zup lug dax lug
- Output: yellow blue green blue

""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and the pattern of ""lug"" and ""dax"" still holds with ""blue"" and ""green"", respectively.

From the fourth example:
- Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
- Output: red red blue green red

""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"". The sequence of ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""green"" respectively, suggesting that ""bluf"" and ""wif"" may share the same color output, ""red,"" and that ""dax"" is still associated with ""green"".

From the fifth example:
- Input: zup bluf lug dax lug
- Output: yellow yellow blue green blue

This also suggests that ""zup"" and ""bluf"" may produce the same color, which is ""yellow"". ""lug"" and ""dax"" continue to correspond to ""blue"" and ""green"", respectively.

Considering all examples, it is consistently observed that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". This observation is supported regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of the context or position in the sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" irrespective of the context it is used in.
From the examples provided:

- ""lug bluf wif"" translates to ""blue blue red""
- ""wif bluf lug"" translates to ""red red blue""
- ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" translates to ""green green red blue yellow""
- ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue red green green red""
- ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red""

We can see the following patterns:

- ""lug"" appears to consistently translate to ""blue""
- ""wif"" appears to consistently translate to ""red""
- ""dax"" appears to consistently translate to ""green""
- ""zup"" appears to consistently translate to ""yellow""

With this understanding, we notice that ""bluf"" causes the word right before it to be repeated in the translation. It does not have a specific color associated with it; instead, it repeats the color word preceding it. There isn't a direct translation for ""bluf"" as a color. Instead, its function is to double the color that comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. When ""bluf"" appears after a color word, the translation output of that color word is repeated.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can look at the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs, focusing particularly on the patterns that emerge around the use of ""walm.""

Here's what we know from the examples:

1. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   Analysis: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and ""dax"" translates to ""green"". The triple ""yellow"" suggests a repeated quality or emphasis that the word ""walm"" might be causing. ""Walm"" appears before ""dax,"" but ""dax"" does not repeat; only ""yellow"" does.

2. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   Analysis: ""wif"" translates to ""red"", ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and ""dax"" translates to ""green"". The triples indicate that ""walm"" is again causing the following word to be repeated.

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Analysis: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" translates to ""red"". Here we again see that ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated thrice.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: The absence of another color word after ""walm"" shows that it simply repeats ""yellow"" thrice.

5. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""dax"" and ""zup"" retain their translations from earlier examples. ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in it being repeated twice more. Another ""walm"" after ""lug"" causes the translation of ""lug"" (which is ""blue"") to be repeated twice more as well.

From these examples, we can conclude that ""walm"" is a repeat function for the color word that follows it. In cases where ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, it repeats the color word that precedes it three times in total. If ""walm"" is followed by another color word, it causes that word to be repeated twice more, resulting in three consecutive outputs of that color.

Rule: walm -> repeats the next color word in the sequence three times. If ""walm"" is the last word, it repeats the preceding color word three times total. If there is no next color word, the last color word before ""walm"" is assumed to be repeated twice after its first occurrence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup walm
    ",Output: green yellow yellow yellow,green yellow yellow yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the ""dax"" is associated with different colors based on its position or context. Let's analyze each example and see how ""dax"" is translated:

1. Input: dax lug wif bluf
   Output: green blue red red
   - ""dax"" at the beginning translates to ""green.""
   
2. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
   Output: blue green green yellow blue red
   - ""dax"" in the second position translates to ""green.""

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" at the beginning followed by ""walm"" translates to a repetition of ""green.""

4. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue
   - ""dax"" at the beginning translates to ""green.""

5. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red
   - ""dax"" appears in different positions always translating to ""green.""

Since in all examples, regardless of position, ""dax"" always translates to ""green,"" we can establish the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Observing the examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the outputs, irrespective of its position in the input string. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

wif -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each given example.
Rule: bluf -> red before wif, green before dax, and blue before lug.
Based on the provided examples, ""walm"" correlates with the color ""green"". In every instance where the word ""walm"" is used, the corresponding output is ""green"". Additionally, whenever ""walm"" follows another word, the number of ""green"" in the output matches the number of words preceding ""walm"" plus one.

Rule:
walm -> the word ""walm"" is translated to a sequence of ""green"", with the number of ""green"" in the sequence being equal to the number of words preceding ""walm"" plus one.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Words like ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""walm"" correspond to colors ""yellow,"" ""red,"" ""green,"" and a repeat of the previously mentioned color, respectively. Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds with the color green. Every instance of ""dax"" in the inputs is associated with the output ""green,"" regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the sequence of words or the words that surround it.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" seems to consistently correspond to the color ""yellow.""

Here is the breakdown of the examples:

- In ""zup bluf dax lug,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
- In ""zup bluf wif,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
- In ""dax zup dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""walm"" to ""green"" as well, with repeated ""green"" for the extra letters in ""walm,"" while ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In ""lug walm zup lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" with extra ""blue"" for the extra letters, and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
- In ""lug zup,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's consider each example and their outputs:

1. Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red

2. Input: dax bluf wif lug
   Output: green green red blue

3. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red

4. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
   Output: blue red blue green green

5. Input: wif zup bluf
   Output: red yellow yellow

Analyzing these patterns, one can notice that bluf takes the color value of the word immediately preceding it. For example, in example 1, the first bluf follows lug, which is blue, and thus the first bluf translates to blue. The second bluf also follows zup which is yellow, and the second bluf translates to yellow.

Considering all the instances:

- bluf follows lug (blue) -> bluf becomes blue in output
- bluf follows zup (yellow) -> bluf becomes yellow in output
- bluf follows dax (green) -> bluf becomes green in output
- bluf follows wif (red) -> bluf becomes red in output

So the rule is:

Rule: bluf takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it.
Rule: walm -> three instances of the color corresponding to the word that comes before 'walm'. If 'walm' follows 'lug', the output is 'blue blue blue', if it follows 'dax', the output is 'green green green', and if it follows 'wif', the output is 'red red red'.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow,blue yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
dax -> green

Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" Therefore, the rule is that the term ""dax"" signifies the color green. This conclusion is drawn from the repetition of the word ""dax"" consistently being associated with the output ""green"" regardless of whether it appears alone or in combination with other words.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we can analyze the examples provided and determine a pattern for the output relative to the input.

Input: wif  
Output: red  
This input and output suggest that ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red.""

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm  
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow  
Here ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red."" However, other words trigger different colors. The pattern is not immediately clear from this example alone, but we see that ""walm"" and ""zup"" are repeated, with ""walm"" linked to ""yellow"" and ""zup"" linked to other colors.

Input: wif walm  
Output: red red red  
Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and we see ""walm"" might trigger additional ""red"" outputs.

Input: wif  
Output: red  
This example reconfirms that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: wif dax zup wif  
Output: red green yellow red  
Here, ""wif"" is still linked to ""red."" ""Dax"" appears to be linked to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Given these examples, it seems clear that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" and that some words correspond to a sequence of colors or a single color.

Therefore, the rule is:  
wif -> red

This means that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Other words in the sequence may dictate the repetition of the colors or introduce new colors, but ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, the term ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Here's how we can determine this:

- In every example, regardless of the other words present (""wif"", ""bluf"", ""dax"", ""walm""), the presence of ""zup"" results in the word ""yellow"" in the output.
- It does not seem to matter where ""zup"" appears in the sequence; its position does not affect its meaning.
- Other words like ""wif"", ""bluf"", ""dax"", ""walm"" correspond to different colors every time they appear, suggesting their output may depend on their position or sequence. ""Zup,"" on the other hand, consistently maps to ""yellow.""

So, the rule that can be deduced for the word ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" generates colors that correspond to the previously mentioned item when one exists, and defaults to ""yellow"" when it is the first item.

Here's the breakdown of each example:

- In the first input ""zup wif bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Since ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it outputs ""red.""
- In ""zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and, therefore, repeats the color of ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- In ""dax bluf wif zup wif,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""Bluf"" takes the color of ""dax,"" thus ""green,"" since it comes right after it.
- In ""lug bluf wif,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" takes on the color ""blue"" since it follows directly after ""lug.""
- ""Lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" has ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax"" corresponding to ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""green,"" respectively. ""Bluf"" follows ""dax,"" so it takes on the green color. Another ""wif"" remains red, and the final ""lug"" is ""blue.""

Thus, the rule seems to be:
bluf -> Repeat the color of the immediately preceding item, if no preceding item, then ""yellow"".

Rule: If an item precedes ""bluf,"" use that item's color; if ""bluf"" is the first item, use ""yellow"".
walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" follows a color-coded word, the color corresponding to that word is repeated three times in the output. 

- ""zup"" correlates to the color ""yellow""
- ""lug"" correlates to the color ""blue""
- ""dax"" correlates to the color ""green""

Therefore, when ""zup"", ""lug"", or ""dax"" precede ""walm"", their associated colors are repeated three times in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup bluf
    ",Output: red yellow yellow,red yellow yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The term ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples.
Based on the examples provided, each word seems to correspond to a specific color. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, every instance of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red."" No matter the context or other words present, ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red."" It does not seem to have a dependency on position or surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the word preceding ""bluf"" seems to determine the color that will follow ""bluf."" Here is the pattern apparent in the examples:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red.""

This pattern suggests that ""bluf"" acts as a signal to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Thus, we can define the rule for ""bluf"" as follows:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Therefore:

bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
Reviewing the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the rule that defines the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

1. In the first example:
   - Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   - Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

2. In the second example:
   - Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   - Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

3. In the third example:
   - Input: wif walm dax
   - Output: red red red green

4. In the fourth example:
   - Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   - Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

5. In the fifth example:
   - Input: dax walm
   - Output: green green green

Looking at the examples, the appearance of the word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here are the specific observations:

- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and its corresponding output color ""blue"" is repeated once.
- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and its corresponding output color ""yellow"" is repeated.
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and its corresponding output color ""red"" is repeated.
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and its corresponding output color ""blue"" is repeated.
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and its corresponding output color ""green"" is repeated.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in an input sequence, the output color is a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm.""

Therefore, the definition can be stated as:

walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the output color associated with the word right before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm
    ",Output: red red red,red red red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, there seems to be a consistent pattern where specific words are translated into specific colors. To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's examine its instances:

- In the first example, ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green.""
- In the second example, ""lug dax wif lug"" becomes ""blue green red blue,"" where ""lug"" appears twice, at the beginning and at the end, corresponding to ""blue"" both times.
- In the third and fourth examples which are identical, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" again.
- In the fifth example, ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red,"" where ""lug"" is ""blue"" once more.

From all these instances, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output.

Here is the pattern observed with the examples and the corresponding outputs:

1. ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""
2. ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue""
3. ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"" -> ""red red yellow red blue green""
4. ""lug dax"" -> ""blue green""
5. ""wif dax zup walm"" -> ""red green yellow yellow yellow""

In each case, irrespective of the surrounding words, ""dax"" always translates to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it is possible to deduce the following pattern:

- The output consists of a sequence of colors.
- Each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output.
- The color ""red"" appears consistently every time the word ""wif"" is present in the input.
- No other input word provided in the examples translates to the color ""red"" in the output.

Given this pattern, we can infer the following rule:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" correlates to the color ""red"" in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look for patterns in the inputs and outputs. We can analyze each example:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

2. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
   Output: red yellow yellow red green

3. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

4. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
   Output: red red yellow red blue green

5. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

From these examples, we can notice that every time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at a corresponding position. Moreover, ""bluf"" never appears alone; it's always prefixed by another nonce word. The word ""bluf"" always causes ""red"" to appear in the output regardless of its position in the input.

The word that precedes ""bluf"" in the input seems to have no effect on the output for ""bluf,"" as it is consistently translated to ""red"" even though ""wif"" and ""zup"" lead to different colors for their own translations (""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively).

Based on the examples given, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

bluf -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
walm -> repeating the color of the previous word three times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears in a sequence, the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Each instance of the word ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the sequence or the other words present.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently leads to the output ""red."" There is no instance where ""wif"" leads to a different color output, regardless of its position or the surrounding words. Therefore, the rule seems straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> the bluf command duplicates the color word that immediately follows it.

Rule: When ""bluf"" is followed by a color word (e.g., dax, zup, wif), the output is that color word repeated twice.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we examine the specific positions where the word ""walm"" is used and the corresponding outputs in each example.

In the first input, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output sequence is three ""red"" colors in a row. In the standard English color pattern of a rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet), there is no repetition of three ""red"" colors in a row, so we can assume ""walm"" is not a straight mapping to a color name but potentially involves repetition of the preceding color.

In the second input, ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and before ""zup lug zup,"" with the corresponding colors being ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red."" Emphasizing the term ""lug walm"" in the output yields ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" may mean to repeat the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) two additional times, for a total of three iterations of the same color.

The third input, ""zup walm dax,"" results in the output ""yellow yellow yellow green."" Given that ""zup"" is associated with yellow and ""dax"" with green, and the two instances of ""yellow"" following ""zup walm"" suggest that like in the previous examples, ""walm"" prompts a repetition of the previous color two more times (a total of three consecutive repetitions).

For the fourth input, where ""walm"" appears after two instances of ""wif"" and before ""lug wif,"" the output contains ""red red green green red red red blue red"" where the sequence ""red red red"" follows ""walm."" Again, ""walm"" appears to indicate a repetition of the previous color instance two more times after its occurrence.

In the last input, ""lug walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" once more showing that ""walm"" is followed by two additional instances of the previous color (blue), making it apparent that ""walm"" indicates triple repetition.

Rule: 

walm -> Leads to a repetition of the color associated with the directly preceding word for a total of three times, including the initial instance.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax
    ",Output: yellow green,yellow green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present.
To deduce the meaning or rule for ""dax,"" let's analyze the given examples by comparing the inputs and outputs to look for patterns. We'll start by looking for consistent mappings from the inputs to the outputs for each non-""dax"" word.

Here are the explicit mappings we can derive:

- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> red
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red

Notice that each occurrence of ""dax"" in the inputs is mapped to ""green"" in the outputs. Across all examples, ""dax"" does not seem to be affected by neighboring words, the position in the sequence, or the number of times it appears. It consistently maps to ""green.""

Considering this consistent mapping in the examples, the meaning of ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at each example and identify patterns relating to the output.

1. ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red green red red""
   Observations:
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""wif"" appears twice and each time it is followed by ""red""

2. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
   Observations:
   - No other words from the previous example are present to correlate with colors.
   - ""wif"" appears once and is followed by ""red""

3. ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" -> ""blue red red blue red""
   Observations:
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""wif"" appears twice and each time it is followed by ""red""

4. ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" -> ""blue green green red green""
   Observations:
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""red""

5. ""zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow green red""
   Observations:
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""red""

Given these observations, a pattern arises: the word ""wif"" is consistently followed by the output ""red."" There are no deviations or context dependencies observed that affect this output. Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" seems to be consistent across all instances. Regardless of the context or the words that come before or after it, ""zup"" always translates to the same color in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" causes the word that immediately precedes it to be repeated. The output is always a repeated color that corresponds to the word just before ""bluf"".

Here's how the rule applies to the given examples:

- Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red (The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""; ""bluf"" causes it to be repeated.)
- Input: dax bluf zup -> Output: green green yellow (The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""; ""bluf"" causes it to be repeated. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".)
- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue (The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""; ""bluf"" causes ""zup"" to be repeated. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and it is followed by another word ""walm"" that also corresponds to ""blue"", then ""dax"" which is ""green"" followed by ""lug"" again resulting in ""blue."")
- Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red (Similar to the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""; ""bluf"" causes it to be repeated.)
- Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red (Similar to the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""; ""bluf"" causes it to be repeated.)

Rule: bluf -> causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to be repeated.
Analyzing the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately follows it three times. Here's how it works with the provided examples:

1. ""lug walm wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red red"", with ""walm wif"" yielding ""blue blue blue.""
2. In ""zup walm lug wif bluf"", the sequence ""walm lug"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow.""
3. ""zup walm"" by itself gives ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" causes the repeat of the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow).
4. In ""wif walm dax zup,"" the part ""walm dax"" produces ""red red red,"" following the color repetition rule for ""wif.""
5. ""zup wif walm"" leads to ""yellow red red red"", where ""walm"" is following ""wif"" and hence repeats ""red"" three times.

Putting this together, we can define the role of ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the word immediately following it to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax
    ",Output: blue green,blue green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
dax -> green

Rule:
From the examples provided, it is evident that whenever the word ""dax"" is present in the input, the word ""green"" is present in the corresponding output. Regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence or the number of other words present, ""dax"" consistently results in the word ""green"" in the output. Therefore, we can deduce that the meaning or rule associated with ""dax"" is that it translates to ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word “wif” corresponds to the color “red.” Each time the word “wif” appears, the color “red” is included in the output in the same position. 

Here is the breakdown of the given examples and how they relate to the outputs:

1. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   (wif -> red, lug -> blue)

2. Input: wif
   Output: red
   (wif -> red)

3. Input: zup wif lug wif
   Output: yellow red blue red
   (zup -> yellow, wif -> red, lug -> blue, wif -> red)

4. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   (wif -> red, walm -> red, zup -> yellow)

5. Input: zup wif lug dax
   Output: yellow red blue green
   (zup -> yellow, wif -> red, lug -> blue, dax -> green)

From the above observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
To identify the meaning of ""bluf,"" we observe its corresponding output in each pair of inputs and outputs. 

- lug wif bluf lug wif -> blue red red blue red
- zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
- dax bluf -> green green
- zup wif dax wif bluf -> yellow red green red red
- dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green

The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" results in the output sandwiching it, repeating the color that immediately follows it. When ""bluf"" is at the end, the color before it is repeated. In the case of being preceded and succeeded by different colors, ""bluf"" repeats the color that comes after it, not the color before.

Thus the rule for ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> meaning: The output color for ""bluf"" is the same as the color of the next word. If ""bluf"" is at the end, it repeats the color of the previous word.

Rule: If bluf is followed by a word, the corresponding color is repeated. If bluf ends the sequence, it takes on the color of the word before it.
The examples suggest that walm always results in a sequence of ""yellow"" in the output. We can confirm this by analyzing each instance:

1. In the first example, ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"", walm is followed by four ""yellow"" in the output before another color appears.
2. In the second example, ""lug walm"", walm is followed by three ""yellow"" without any other color appearing afterward, as ""lug"" renders ""blue"" before walm is encountered.
3. In the third example, ""zup walm wif"", walm is followed by three ""yellow"" and then ""red"", which corresponds to the word ""wif"" that follows.
4. In the fourth example, ""wif lug walm"", walm is followed by three ""yellow"", and ""lug"" before it gives ""blue"".
5. In the fifth example, ""lug zup walm lug"", walm is again followed by three ""yellow"" and is preceded by ""blue"" and ""yellow"" from ""lug"" and ""zup"" respectively. 

Conclusively, the word ""walm"" seems to produce three instances of ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, we can denote the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: walm -> meaning generates three ""yellow"" colors in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" seems to correspond to the color yellow in the outputs.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to be acting as a modifier that replicates the color associated with the preceding word. Every time ""bluf"" follows another word, the output color is the same as the color assigned to the preceding word. Therefore, ""bluf"" does not represent a color by itself; instead, it signals the repetition of the previous color.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in the output. Each time ""dax"" is an input, ""green"" is the respective output.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following patterns:

- When ""wif"" is preceded by ""zup"", the output color is ""red"".
- When ""wif"" is preceded by ""dax"", the output color is also ""red"".
- When ""wif"" is preceded by ""lug"", the output color is again ""red"".
- When ""wif"" is the only element after another word, such as ""dax wif"" or ""lug wif"", it results in ""red"".
- Even when ""wif"" is followed by a different word, such as in ""lug wif bluf"", it results in ""red"".

In each instance, regardless of the preceding word or the presence of a following word, the appearance of ""wif"" corresponds consistently with the output ""red"". Therefore:

wif -> ""red""
Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow.""
Observing the input and output pairs, the word bluf seems to consistently lead to the output ""blue blue"" regardless of the words that come before or after it. This indicates that bluf directly translates to ""blue blue"". Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> ""blue blue""
Based on the given examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" seems to depend on the word that appears immediately before it. Here is the pattern observed:

1. When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red.""
2. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
3. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red.""
4. When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Thus, it appears that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before it three times. Using this pattern, we can create the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can analyze the relationship between the input and the output to deduce the meaning of ""wif"".

In every example where ""wif"" appears, ""red"" is consistently the first color in the output, regardless of its position in the input. This indicates that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".

Here is the breakdown:

1. Input: lug walm zup wif 
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""lug"", ""walm"", and ""zup"" correlate to ""blue"", ""blue"", and ""yellow"", respectively, followed by ""red"" for ""wif"".

2. Input: lug zup wif
   Output: blue yellow red
   - ""lug"" and ""zup"" correlate to ""blue"" and ""yellow"", respectively, followed by ""red"" for ""wif"".

3. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow
   - The output starts with ""red"", which corresponds to ""wif"", followed by ""yellow"" for ""zup"".

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow"", followed by ""red"" for ""wif"" and repeated ""red"" for ""walm"".

5. Input: wif
   Output: red
   - Only ""wif"" is present, and the output is solely ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples given, it appears that 'bluf' doubles the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. Here is the breakdown according to the examples:

- wif corresponds to red, so ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red"".
- zup corresponds to yellow, so ""zup bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow"".
- dax corresponds to green (deduced from the third example), so ""dax zup bluf"" becomes ""green yellow yellow"" due to the presence of 'zup bluf' immediately after 'dax'.
- ""zup bluf"" consistently results in ""yellow yellow"".
- lug corresponds to blue (deduced from the fifth example), so ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" becomes ""red red blue green red"".

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color name of the word just before it.
Based on the given examples, the word `walm` appears to repeat the color of the word that directly precedes it.

Here's the analysis:

- In the first example, `lug walm` translates to `blue blue`.
- In the second, `zup walm` translates to `yellow yellow`.
- In the third, `wif walm` translates to `red red`.
- In the fourth, both occurrences of `wif walm` translate to `red red` and `lug walm` translates to `blue blue`.
- In the fifth, `dax walm` translates to `green green`.

So, the rule seems to be: `walm` represents a repetition of the previous color.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color name of the word before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Whenever ""lug"" occurs in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, we can infer a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" as it correlates to a specific output in each case. Comparing the input and output, we can deduce that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" Regardless of the surrounding words or their order, ""dax"" maps to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Reviewing the provided examples and focusing on the occurrences of the nonce word ""wif,"" we can try to deduce its meaning by looking at the patterns in the outputs.

Let's break down the examples:

1. Input: dax wif lug dax
   Output: green red blue green
   - The word ""dax"" is associated with ""green."" The word ""lug"" is associated with ""blue.""

2. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   - The word ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" is also associated with yellow, and ""lug"" is associated with blue.

3. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green
   - The word ""dax"" is associated with ""green."" The word ""walm"" is also associated with green.

4. Input: zup wif zup
   Output: yellow red yellow
   - The word ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow.""

5. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   - The word ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow."" The word ""bluf"" has not appeared before, but it is associated with ""red"" in this example.

From the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" when inserted between two of the same word (for example, ""dax wif dax"" or ""zup wif zup""), results in the color representation of the word being flanked by ""red."" When ""wif"" is inserted before a word we haven't seen, it also seems to add 'red.' It does not appear to matter whether ""wif"" is surrounded by the same words or different words; ""wif"" is consistently associated with the color ""red.""

Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red

This rule works for all the given examples.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" appears to consistently translate to the color ""yellow."" 

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond with the output of a color repeated once. However, the color repeated is not consistent across examples but is dependent on the preceding word. 

- In example one, ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red.""
- In example two and three, ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green.""
- In example four, ""bluf"" after ""zup"" results in ""yellow yellow"" (assuming ""dax"" keeps its ""green"" output consistent).
- In example five, ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue.""

The pattern suggests that the output color is determined by the word immediately before ""bluf"", and the output color is repeated twice. Without explicit information on what color each word corresponds to (except for the given examples), the best we can determine is that:

Rule: bluf -> The color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf,"" repeated twice.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to examine the input and output pairs to see if there's a consistent pattern associated with each occurrence of ""walm."" Here is the analysis:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup | Output: red red red green yellow
   ""wif"" and ""dax"" both translate to ""red"" and ""green"" when not directly associated with ""walm."" ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup walm | Output: yellow yellow yellow
   ""Zup"" by itself is ""yellow,"" but the presence of ""walm"" turns the following word into ""yellow"" too.

3. Input: dax walm zup lug dax | Output: green green green yellow blue green
   ""Dax"" on its own is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" ""Walm"" is followed by repeating the color of the preceding word.

4. Input: wif lug walm | Output: red blue blue blue
   ""Wif"" by itself is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes the following word to repeat the ""blue"" color.

5. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf | Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   ""Zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" seems like a duplication of ""red."" ""Walm"" in this case replicates the ""yellow"" color of ""zup.""

Rule: It appears that ""walm"" causes the following word(s) to take on the color of the word directly preceding ""walm.""

Walm -> meaning: Causes the following word(s) to replicate the color of the word immediately before ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position within a sequence. Each instance of ""dax"" is translated to ""green"".
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Every instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding output.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the rule for determining the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" can be induced from its consistent association with a particular output color, regardless of the position 'zup' occurs in the input sequence or the colors that correspond to the other words. In every instance where ""zup"" appears, the output color linked to it is ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green."" However, it should be noted that this deduction assumes that the colors given in the output are consistent and are assigned to specific words regardless of their position or combination in the input. The rule appears to be independent of the context as the word ""bluf"" is always associated with the same color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sentence.

Rule: bluf -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Specifically:

- In example 1, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and the color ""red"" associated with ""wif"" is repeated.
- In example 2, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and the color ""yellow"" associated with ""zup"" is repeated.
- In example 3, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and again ""red"" is repeated.
- In example 4, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" with the repetition of ""red.""
- In example 5, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" leading to the repetition of ""red.""

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows: 

Rule: walm -> the same color as the word before walm.

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""zup"" is present in the input, the output includes the color ""yellow"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to a color. To deduce the specific rule for ""bluf,"" let us look at the context in which it appears:

- In the first two examples, ""bluf"" is associated with contrasting colors when combined with ""dax"" and ""wif."" ""Dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" When ""bluf"" is used with ""dax,"" it generates an additional ""green,"" and with ""wif,"" an additional ""red.""

- In the third example, ""bluf"" is used with ""dax"" only, and the output is double ""green,"" which is consistent with the outcome of the first example.

- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" appears between ""wif"" and ""lug dax wif."" The output following ""bluf"" is ""blue green red,"" which doesn't seem to have a straightforward pattern that directly converts ""bluf"" to a specific color. However, the ""red"" corresponds to the ""wif"" that follows and ""green"" corresponds to ""dax.""

- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" appears after ""walm wif"" and the output colors following ""bluf"" are ""red red,"" which correspond with the translation of ""wif.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" could mean ""repeat,"" specifically repeating the color associated with the following word. Let's put this rule to the test:

Rule:
bluf -> repeat the color associated with the next word (essentially a duplication of the color associated with the word that follows ""bluf"").

For the given examples, this would mean:
- ""dax bluf wif"" results in green (from ""dax""), green (repeat ""dax"" because of ""bluf""), red (from ""wif"").
- ""wif bluf dax"" results in red (from ""wif""), red (repeat ""wif"" because of ""bluf""), green (from ""dax"").
- ""dax bluf"" results in green (from ""dax""), green (repeat ""dax"" because of ""bluf"").
- ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" results in red (from ""wif""), red (repeat ""wif"" because of ""bluf""), with ""lug"" being a separate context not defined by the examples, then green (from ""dax""), red (from ""wif"").
- ""dax walm wif bluf"" results in green (from ""dax""), green (from ""walm"" - assuming ""walm"" translates to green as well), red (from ""wif""), red (repeat ""wif"" because of ""bluf"").
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine how it is used in the different examples and the corresponding outputs.

Here are the noticeable patterns:

1. When ""zup walm"" occurs, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" by itself in another example (""wif walm dax zup"") also leads to ""yellow,"" but when combined with ""walm,"" the output for ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

2. A similar pattern occurs with ""lug wif walm,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" seems to cause the repetition of the word ""red"" three times instead of once.

3. With ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" is translated to ""green,"" and with ""walm"" following it, the output is ""green"" repeated three times again.

4. ""Lug walm wif lug"" outputs ""blue blue blue red blue."" ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" (""blue"") and proceeds to repeat it twice more, and ""wif"" after ""walm"" corresponds to ""red.""

The repeating pattern indicates that ""walm"" causes the color word before it to be repeated three times in the output. Therefore, ""walm"" works as a repeater for the preceding color descriptor.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color word directly preceding it to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax wif lug walm zup
    ",Output: red green red blue blue blue yellow,red green red blue blue blue yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue."" There is no variation in the output in response to the input containing ""lug,"" regardless of the context in which ""lug"" appears. Therefore, the rule appears to be straightforward:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Given the provided examples, we can induce the following:

- Every time the word ""wif"" appears, it is followed by the word ""red"" in the output.
- The word ""wif"" does not depend on its position in the input sequence to be associated with ""red"".

From this, we can deduce the rule for the word ""wif"":

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
To induce the rule, I will analyze the patterns and the corresponding color assignments. I need to test whether bluf has a static meaning or if it depends on context.

Looking at the examples:

1. ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" -> ""green green red yellow green""
   The color sequence for ""bluf"" is ""red,"" but the word ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" on both sides of ""bluf.""

2. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue""
   The sequence for ""bluf"" here is ""yellow,"" but it follows ""zup,"" which is associated with ""yellow"" as well, and ""wif,"" which is associated with ""red.""

3. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
   In this example, ""bluf"" translates to ""red,"" the same as the color associated with ""wif.""

4. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
   ""Bluf"" now correlates with ""green,"" the same color associated with ""dax.""

5. ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""
   Here ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" the same as the preceding ""zup.""

By analyzing these patterns, it appears that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.
Observing the patterns:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""
- The presence of ""walm"" always results in a repetition of the color that precedes it.

Considering that ""walm"" always leads to the repetition of the previous color three times, we can deduce:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the preceding color three times. Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color-indicating word, replace ""walm"" with three instances of the color that precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax zup wif
    ",Output: blue green yellow red,blue green yellow red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Each instance of the word ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output. Therefore, ""dax"" means ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""wif"" always results in ""red"" in the output sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" appears to be associated with the color ""yellow."" In each instance where ""zup"" is present, it corresponds with the output ""yellow."" 

Therefore, the rule can be written as:
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is the color ""yellow.""
The word ""bluf"" seems to correspond with the color that is mentioned before it. When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green."" When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue."" And, when ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red."" Therefore:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word before it.
Based on the examples given, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

Rule: walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color associated with the previous word thrice.

Examples for clarification:
- In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""walm"" leads to ""green"" being said three times.
- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax
    ",Output: blue green,blue green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" is present in the input, it corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can make the following observations:

- Whenever ""dax"" is mentioned, the corresponding output color is green.
- The position of ""dax"" in the input string does not seem to influence its corresponding color.

Therefore, we can deduce that ""dax"" is associated with the color green, regardless of the input's sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" has a consistent outcome in the output: the presence of ""wif"" always results in the word ""red"" being part of the output. This is a direct correlation that can be observed regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence or the other words present. Hence, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Observing the given inputs and their corresponding outputs, it seems that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"". Each time ""zup"" appears in an input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output.

Rule:
zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> red if preceded by ""wif,"" blue if preceded by ""lug,"" green if preceded by ""dax,"" otherwise follows the color indicated by the word immediately before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can observe how the output changes based on its presence in the input compared to the other known elements. 

From the first example:
Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green
Here, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green both times it appears, but there's an extra green before ""red"" which corresponds to ""wif"". The presence of ""walm"" is followed by another green before the pattern changes, so it seems ""walm"" may cause a repetition of the color before it.

From the second example:
Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
Here, ""wif"" correlates with red, ""zup"" correlates with yellow, ""lug"" correlates with blue, and ""dax"" correlates with green. After ""zup"" which correlates to yellow, we see ""walm"" and then two additional yellows. This supports the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color before it.

From the third example:
Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red
The first time ""bluf"" appears, it is followed by a green which corresponds to ""dax"". However, the pattern changes after the second ""bluf"", with two reds in a row instead of a green. This is after the ""walm"", suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the color before it, which is red corresponding to ""wif"".

From the fourth example:
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Again, we see ""dax"" which we know correlates with green, followed by ""walm"" and an additional green. This consistently matches the repetitions we've seen before.

From the fifth example:
Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
The pattern is consistent with previous observations where ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow, and then we see two additional yellows.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it to be repeated in the output sequence.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color of the preceding word in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif
    ",Output: blue red,blue red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Looking at each provided example, we see the word ""lug"" always translates to the same color in the output, regardless of its position or the other words around it. In every case, ""lug"" outputs the word ""blue.""

So the rule appears to be simple:

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in the output regardless of its position or the other words present. Therefore, we can induce that ""dax"" means ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

This rule is evident from the examples provided; each time we see the word ""wif"", the output consistently includes the color ""red"" directly corresponding to its position.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each unique word is consistently mapped to a particular color. The word ""zup"" is consistently output as ""yellow"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence.

So the rule appears to be:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
Based on the given examples, the following patterns are observed:

- Whenever the word ""bluf"" is present, the word ""red"" immediately follows in the output.
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green.""
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the word ""blue.""
- The word ""walm"" corresponds to the word ""green,"" but when following ""dax,"" it still means ""green"", implying that ""walm"" maintains its meaning regardless of context.
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red.""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow.""

However, it should be noted that ""bluf"" always appears after ""wif"" and before ""dax"" in these examples. Without an example where ""bluf"" stands alone or is paired with different surrounding words, we can't be entirely sure of its independent meaning.

Given that ""bluf"" always results in an additional ""red"" in the output and it directly follows ""wif,"" it suggests that ""bluf"" also means ""red"" or acts as a reinforcement of the color ""red"" when next to ""wif.""

Rule: bluf -> red (when following ""wif"").
Rule: walm -> repetition of the previous color until a different color word is mentioned.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
dax -> green

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the given examples regardless of its position in the sequence. Every instance of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string or the presence of other words. Therefore:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" is included in the output in the same position relative to the other colors.
Based on the given examples, the word 'zup' consistently translates to the color 'yellow'.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf means to repeat the color associated with the word just before it.
Based on the examples given, the word ""walm"" seems to lead to a repetition of the color immediately preceding it, in the sequence of colors in the output.

Let's analyze the examples provided:

1. ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red""
The word ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"" in the output. The repetition of ""green"" follows, indicating that ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be repeated.

2. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue""
Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, and ""blue"" is repeated.

3. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue""
Once again, ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" which is ""blue"" and ""blue"" is repeated.

4. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, and ""yellow"" is repeated.

5. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
In this example, there is only one color ""blue"" before ""walm,"" and it is repeated afterward.

Rule:
walm -> Causes the preceding color name to be repeated in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    ",Output: green blue blue blue green green green,green blue blue blue green green green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can infer a pattern that associates the nonce word ""lug"" with a specific color. It appears that whenever ""lug"" is mentioned in the input, the color ""blue"" is mentioned in the corresponding output.

Here are the associations:

- ""lug dax wif"" -> ""blue green red""
- ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue""
- ""dax lug dax wif dax"" -> ""green blue green red green""
- ""wif lug bluf"" -> ""red blue blue""
- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""

Rule: lug -> blue
Reviewing the provided examples, the rule seems to be as follows:

- In every example, ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

dax -> green. Meaning: The nonce word ""dax"" means the color green.
From the examples provided, we can induce that the word ""wif"" results in the color ""red"" in every output where it appears. It does not seem to depend on position or the presence of other words.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" has a consistent meaning across different contexts, as it always translates to the same word in the output. The other words like ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and ""bluf"" also appear to have consistent translations based on their appearances in the input and corresponding output. Here are the observed patterns:

- ""zup"" always results in ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" results in ""blue"" when it appears after ""zup.""
- ""dax"" results in ""green"" when it appears after ""lug.""
- ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup.""
- ""wif"" results in ""red"" when it follows ""zup"" or ""lug"" or appears alone after ""zup.""
- ""bluf"" results in ""red"" when it appears after ""wif.""

From these observations, we can create a direct rule for ""zup"":

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"" (regardless of its position or the presence of other words)

For the other words, the rules seem to be:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> yellow when following zup, otherwise the rule is not clear
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red when following wif, otherwise the rule is not clear

The rules for ""walm"" and ""bluf"" are based on limited context, and more examples would be needed to fully understand any additional rules that may apply to these words in different contexts. However, for the purpose of this task, the most important rule derived is for ""zup.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that precedes it in the sequence. More specifically, ""bluf"" takes on the meaning of the most recent color word mentioned before it. Here's the analysis of the examples:

Example 1:
- ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue""
- ""dax lug"" corresponds to ""green blue""

Example 2:
- ""lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red red"" (bluf takes the meaning of ""wif"" which is ""red"")
- ""dax lug bluf"" corresponds to ""green blue blue"" (bluf takes the meaning of ""lug"" which is ""blue"")

Example 3:
- ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red"" (bluf takes the meaning of ""wif"" which is ""red"")
- ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green"" (walm likely means green since ""dax"" is followed by three ""green"")

Example 4:
- ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow"" (bluf takes the meaning of ""zup"" which is ""yellow"")
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Example 5:
- ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green"" (bluf takes the meaning of ""dax"" which is ""green"")

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Bluf takes the meaning of the color word immediately preceding it. If no color word is preceding it, additional context might be needed, but based on the examples given, this situation doesn't occur.
walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the previous word. Rule: When 'walm' follows another word, it indicates that the color associated with the preceding word should be repeated. If 'walm' is used multiple times in sequence, the color is repeated for as many times as 'walm' appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug means ""blue"".
dax -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context.

Rule: In each provided set of inputs and outputs, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. There is no context provided that changes the meaning of ""dax."" Therefore, the rule is that the nonce word ""dax"" means the color green.
Based on the input and output patterns provided, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Thus, we can determine the following:

wif -> meaning. The meaning is ""red.""

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" is included in the output at the corresponding position.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output. No other words in the inputs correspond to ""yellow"" in the outputs.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to mirror the color associated with the word directly preceding it. Here is the rule induction based on the examples:

- In ""zup bluf wif"" (yellow yellow red), ""bluf"" mirrors ""zup"", which is yellow.
- In ""lug bluf"" (blue blue), ""bluf"" mirrors ""lug"", which is blue.
- In ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" (yellow green green yellow green), the ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is green, mirroring the color associated with ""dax"".
- In ""zup bluf lug zup"" (yellow yellow blue yellow), ""bluf"" mirrors ""zup"" which is yellow.
- In ""wif bluf"" (red red), ""bluf"" mirrors ""wif"", which is red.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

Therefore:
bluf -> mirrors the color of the preceding word.
walm -> meaning: Repetition of the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: Whenever the word 'walm' appears, it signals that the color of the preceding word should be repeated three additional times. For example, in the first input, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm"" the output is ""green blue blue blue,"" repeating ""blue"" which is the color associated with ""lug,"" three times after the initial instance.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each given example.
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in all provided examples.
Based on the examples provided, each word corresponds to a unique color:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
- lug -> blue

The word 'wif' consistently corresponds to the color 'red' regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"". 

This conclusion is based on the consistent presence of ""yellow"" in the output whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, regardless of its position.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" let's look at the correspondence between the inputs and outputs in the examples provided. 

- In the first example, ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" maps to ""yellow red red yellow blue."" The words ""zup"" and ""lug"" at the beginning and end of the sequence correspond to ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" respectively. The presence of ""bluf"" in the third position in the input is matched with the second ""red"" in the output, while ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red.""

- In the second example, ""dax bluf"" maps to ""green green."" ""dax"" can be presumed to mean ""green"" since it's the same in both input and output. The presence of ""bluf"" correlates with the second ""green.""

- In the third example, ""zup bluf"" maps to ""yellow yellow."" Since ""zup"" has been previously determined to mean ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" in this instance also corresponds to ""yellow.""

- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf dax lug"" maps to ""yellow yellow green blue."" Using the meanings we've deduced earlier, ""zup,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""yellow,"" ""green,"" and ""blue,"" respectively. Since ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow yellow,"" we can assume ""bluf,"" in this case, means ""yellow"" or indicates a repetition of the color mentioned before it.

- In the fifth example, ""dax lug wif bluf"" maps to ""green blue red red."" Given that ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif"" correspond to ""green,"" ""blue,"" and ""red,"" respectively, ""bluf"" again seems to correlate with a repetition of the color mentioned just before it, ""red.""

Given the patterns observed, the rule for ""bluf"" could be: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule:

bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" means to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before it in the sequence.
Examining the given examples and the associated outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"". Let's analyze the patterns.

1. ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green""
2. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
3. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
4. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" -> ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red""

From these examples, we can observe that every time ""walm"" occurs, it repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it:

1. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue""
2. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red""
3. When ""walm"" is at the end of a sequence ""zup walm"" it repeats the color of the previous word, in this case ""yellow yellow"".

Therefore, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to repeat.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a color. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. 

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, every time the word ""wif"" appears, the output includes the color ""red."" So it can be concluded that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we can look for patterns in the examples provided:

1. When ""zup"" appears alone (Example 2), the output is ""yellow."" This suggests that ""zup"" on its own translates to ""yellow.""

2. Whenever ""zup"" appears before another word (Examples 1, 3, and 5), it precedes ""yellow"" in the output. This supports the idea that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

3. In Example 4, ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow,"" which suggests ""lug"" probably translates to ""blue"" and ""zup"" again to ""yellow.""

4. The example where ""zup"" is repeated (Example 5), ""zup lug zup lug wif,"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow blue red,"" which again confirms that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and also implies that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

Based on the consistent pattern across all examples, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> yellow
Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" In sequences where ""bluf"" appears, it's translated to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position or the other words present.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to represent repetition of the color word that comes before it. Here's the analysis for each example:

1. Input: lug walm → Output: blue blue blue (The word ""lug"" is translated to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" leads to repeating ""blue"" two more times for a total of three.)
2. Input: lug walm dax → Output: blue blue blue green (After the three ""blue,"" the new word ""dax"" translates to ""green."")
3. Input: zup walm → Output: yellow yellow yellow (Here, ""zup"" seems to translate to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated two more times.)
4. Input: zup dax walm → Output: yellow green green green (The ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times.)
5. Input: zup bluf wif walm → Output: yellow yellow red red red (Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" translates to another ""yellow,"" then ""wif"" translates as ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated twice more.)

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it to be repeated two more times after its initial mention. When ""walm"" follows a color word, it indicates a total of three appearances of that color in the output.

Rule: walm -> The output of walm is to repeat the color word immediately preceding it two additional times, resulting in that color word being said a total of three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of the context in which it appears. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of context or the other words it appears with.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. 

- In ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"", wif corresponds to red, so the first bluf corresponds to red. Then zup corresponds to yellow, so the second bluf corresponds to yellow.
- In ""dax bluf"", dax corresponds to green, so the bluf that follows corresponds to green as well.
- In ""zup wif bluf"", wif corresponds to red, so the bluf corresponds to red.
- In ""zup bluf lug dax lug"", zup corresponds to yellow, so the first bluf corresponds to yellow. Then dax corresponds to green, and lug follows dax, so lug corresponds to blue.
- In ""wif bluf dax"", wif corresponds to red, so the bluf that follows corresponds to red, and then dax corresponds to green.
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color green regardless of its position in the input sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red,"" regardless of context or position in the sequence.
Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can analyze the occurrences of the word in the given input and the corresponding output.

- In the first example, the appearance of ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is between ""zup"" and ""lug"" and translates to ""red"" in that position as well.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" again follows ""zup"" but precedes ""lug"" and still corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is placed after ""wif"" and corresponds to ""red.""

From the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when following ""wif"" and corresponds to ""yellow"" when following ""zup."" However, this requires an additional distinction: in the second example, where ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" yields ""yellow red red yellow blue,"" although ""bluf"" is following a ""wif,"" it corresponds to ""red,"" not ""yellow."" This suggests that ""bluf"" might correspond to ""red"" consistently, and the yellow in the other examples might come from ""zup.""

Analyzing the other words in comparison to the colors, ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue"" consistently. However, ""lug"" yields both blue and yellow outcomes when it follows ""zup,"" indicating ""zup"" could mean yellow.

If we assign ""lug"" as ""blue,"" ""wif"" as ""red,"" and ""zup"" as ""yellow,"" the outputs become consistent with the translations. ""dax"" seems to correspond to the color not represented by the previous colors, which appears to be ""green.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be independent of context; ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red"" in the given data set.

Rule: bluf -> red
walm -> yellow

Rule: Every instance of the nonce word ""walm"" in the input corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output. All examples provided are consistent with this rule.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: dax -> green

So according to the provided examples, regardless of the context or the other words it's combined with (like ""wif"" or ""lug wif""), the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" This suggests that ""dax"" means ""green.""
Based on the given examples, it seems that each unique word corresponds to a unique color. Here's the breakdown:

- lug is consistently translated to blue
- dax is consistently translated to green
- bluf likely corresponds to green based on the first example, as it's alongside 'dax'
- zup is consistently translated to yellow

Given that 'wif' stands alone in the second example and translates to 'red', it seems that 'wif' is not dependent on context or position. In each occurrence, regardless of what comes before or after it, 'wif' translates to 'red'. 

Rule:
wif -> red
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, irrespective of the context in which it is used. Each occurrence of ""walm"" after ""zup"" seems to add two additional instances of ""yellow"" to the output, suggesting a repetition multiplier rule for the word following ""zup."" When the word ""wif"" is introduced between ""zup"" and ""walm,"" it changes the output to ""red"" instead of ""yellow,"" and the repetition multiplier rule still applies, with ""walm"" producing three instances of ""red."" The presence of ""bluf"" after ""zup"" results in one extra ""yellow."" Each word following ""zup"" has a specific rule that affects the output, either by changing the color or the color frequency.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" let's examine its output across all given examples:

Input: dax bluf lug wif
Output: green green blue red

Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green

In this case, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
Output: yellow green yellow green red red

In this example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
Output: red red yellow red blue green

In this final example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

Since ""bluf"" produces different colors in different contexts, it cannot directly correspond to a single color. However, it appears that ""bluf"" takes the color output by the word that precedes it. In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output for ""dax"" is ""green,"" so ""bluf"" results in a green output. The same pattern follows for all other examples; ""bluf"" mirrors the color of the word before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word in the sequence.
Based on the examples given, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to mean repeating the color of the previous word thrice. Here's how that rule applies in each example:

Input: dax wif walm -> Output: green red red red
- ""walm"" means three reds following the color red, which is given for ""wif"".

Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue
- ""walm"" indicates three blues following the color blue, which corresponds to ""lug"".

Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green
- ""walm"" means three reds after ""wif"", and then ""dax"" changes the sequence by adding a green.

Input: dax walm zup -> Output: green green green yellow
- Here, ""walm"" translates into three greens after the color for ""dax"", which is green, followed by a yellow for ""zup"".

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
- ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" which is blue, three times, and then the sequence continues with green for ""dax"", red for ""wif"", followed by a change with ""bluf"" and back to ""dax"".

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning is the repetition of the color represented by the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"".
Based on the provided examples, the term wif refers to a specific color. Each time the term wif appears in an input, the output is 'red.' Thus, wif consistently correlates with the color red, irrespective of its position in the sequence or the other words present.

Rule: wif -> red
From analyzing the examples given, the word `zup` seems to correspond consistently with the color `yellow`.

Therefore, the rule is:
zup -> yellow
Analyzing the provided input and output examples, it can be noticed that each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""

Here is the relation extracted from the given examples:

- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""bluf"" -> blue
- ""walm"" -> not explicitly given, but seems to follow the rule where it is repeated thrice, which suggests ""walm"" might translate to ""blue blue blue"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be: 

Rule: ""bluf"" -> blue
Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word multiple times. The number of repetitions appears to equal the number of letters in the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Each subsequent word corresponds to a different color. ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" probably means yellow, the same as ""zup"". Since ""walm"" corresponds to blue just like ""lug"", it seems that multiple nonce words can correspond to the same color.

Rule: ""dax"" -> Green. Other words map to colors as follows: ""zup"" and ""bluf"" -> Yellow, ""lug"" and ""walm"" -> Blue, ""wif"" -> Red.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
zup -> yellow. Rule: The nonce word zup is consistently translated to the color yellow in all provided examples.
Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word that directly precedes ""bluf."" If ""bluf"" is the first word, there is no color to repeat, and it appears that ""bluf"" does not generate an output in this particular case.

Evidence to support the rule:

- In ""dax bluf,"" the color associated with ""dax"" is green. Directly after ""bluf,"" we see green repeated.
- In ""wif bluf dax,"" the color for ""wif"" is red and the color for ""dax"" is green. The output after ""bluf"" is red, showing that ""bluf"" causes the color for ""wif"" to repeat before continuing with the sequence.
- In ""lug wif bluf,"" the color for ""lug"" is blue and ""wif"" is red. The output for ""bluf"" in this case is red, which is the color associated with ""wif,"" the word right before ""bluf.""
- In ""lug bluf dax lug,"" the sequence blue-blue-green-blue occurs. ""Bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug"" (which is blue) before moving on to ""dax.""
- In ""lug bluf wif,"" ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the color blue gets repeated before continuing with the color for ""wif,"" which is red.

Thus the rule is confirmed with the provided examples.
walm -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: When the word 'walm' appears in an input, the output is the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word in the input thrice. For instance, when 'dax' precedes 'walm', the color 'green' associated with 'dax' is repeated three times as 'green green green'. Similarly, if 'wif' precedes 'walm', the color 'red' associated with 'wif' is repeated three times as 'red red red'.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can infer a mapping of nonce words to colors. Keeping consistent with the outputs given:

- ""wif"" maps to ""red""
- ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" maps to ""green""

Now looking at ""lug,"" we notice that it consistently maps to ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the series of words.

So the rule for ""lug"" would be:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green"".
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position within a sequence of words.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" It appears consistently in each example that whenever ""zup"" is present, the output includes the color ""yellow.""
Analyzing the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color that matches the color of the word immediately preceding it. Here, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and following each of these, ""bluf"" translates to the same color as the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the input and output patterns:

Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue
Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" also to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red
""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" to ""red.""

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green
""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""walm"" to ""green.""

From these examples, we can observe that ""walm"" takes on the color corresponding to the word preceding it. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it is ""blue,"" and when it follows ""dax,"" it is ""green."" 

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" as consistently shown in the examples provided.
In the given examples, each occurrence of the nonce word ""dax"" is translated to ""green."" It seems that ""dax"" does not depend on the context or position within the string of words, as it is consistently translated to ""green"" regardless of its position. In addition, the translations of the other words (e.g., ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red"") also appear consistently across examples.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it is evident that each unique word corresponds to a unique color. The word ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words around it. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red.""
Observing the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow"" regardless of the context in which it appears. It is not influenced by the position in the sentence nor by the surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples given where each instance of the word ""bluf"" translates to ""blue,"" but the output always includes an extra ""blue,"" it is likely that ""bluf"" itself means ""blue."" Additionally, it appears that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output, for example, ""lug"" also translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> blue
To induce the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze each input/output pair:

1. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   Rule observed: ""walm"" has produced three ""blue"" outputs.

2. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   Rule observed: ""walm"" has produced three ""green"" outputs.

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Rule observed: ""walm"" has produced three ""yellow"" outputs.

4. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   Rule observed: ""walm"" has produced three ""blue"" outputs, the same color as the word that precedes it (""lug"").

5. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   Rule observed: ""walm"" has produced three ""green"" outputs, the same color as the first word (""dax"").

Across all examples, ""walm"" seems to produce three outputs of the same color, which appears to be dictated by the color associated with the word preceding ""walm"" or the first word in the sequence.

With this in mind, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the immediately preceding word or, if it is the second word, the first word, three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word (or the first word if in second position) three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in the provided examples.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the term ""dax"" corresponds with the color green in the output consistently. Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" is present in the output, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input string or the presence of other words.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeat the color of the word that comes directly before it.

Rule: When bluf follows another word, it takes on the color associated with that previous word.
To determine the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns:

1. Every time ""walm"" appears, the word “green” appears in the output.
2. ""Walm"" does not seem to be affected by its position in the list; regardless of its position before or after certain words, ""green"" is always in the output.
3. No other word in the inputs appears to directly correspond to ""green"" in the outputs, which suggests that the word “walm” specifically corresponds to ""green"" and not a more complex rule including its position or surrounding words.

Based on these observations:

Rule: Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the output. Therefore, walm -> green.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word lug consistently translates to the color blue in each example.
Reviewing the given examples, we can try to identify a pattern related to the word 'dax' and its output.

Input: zup dax walm lug wif  
Output: yellow green green green blue red  

Input: zup lug dax  
Output: yellow blue green  

Input: wif bluf lug dax wif  
Output: red red blue green red  

Input: dax walm wif  
Output: green green green red  

Input: dax zup  
Output: green yellow  

By examining these examples, it seems that the word immediately after 'dax' takes on the color green in the output.

dax -> meaning. The word following 'dax' is colored green.

Rule: If a word follows 'dax', it is translated as green in the output.
Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" and its output repeats for the number of instances ""walm"" occurred before it plus one.

wif -> red

Explanation:

- In the first example, ""wif"" translates directly to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"" (blue), so ""wif"" remains ""red.""
- In the third example, there are three instances of ""walm"" after ""wif,"" so ""wif"" translates to ""red"" repeated three times plus one for its own presence, totaling four times.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" comes after one instance of ""walm,"" so ""wif"" translates to ""red"" repeated once plus one for its own presence, totaling twice.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" precedes one instance of ""walm,"" so ""wif"" translates to ""red"" twice—once for its own presence and once for the following ""walm.""
zup -> ""yellow""

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"", and the number of times ""zup"" is used corresponds to the number of times the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.
bluf -> meaning. Rule: bluf translates to the same color as the word immediately preceding it. If there is no word before bluf, it defaults to the color blue.
Given the examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" affects the color words that follow it by repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" For instance, whenever ""walm"" is found after another color word, the color associated with that word repeats for the number of times ""walm"" appears, or until another color word breaks the pattern.

Let's analyze the given examples to derive the pattern:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" so ""walm"" follows the same pattern, repeating the color of the preceding word.
- The third and fourth examples further confirm this rule, with ""dax walm"" resulting in ""green green green"" and ""lug walm"" leading to ""blue blue blue"" again.
- The fifth example with ""lug walm"" also results in ""blue blue blue,"" consistent with the same rule.

It's important to note that ""walm"" does not have its own associated color but mimics the color of the preceding word.

Rule: *Walm* -> When ""walm"" follows a color word, it causes the color associated with that word to repeat until a different color word appears or the sequence ends.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""blue.""

Here are the deductions from the examples:

- In the first example, ""dax lug wif"" translates to ""green blue red."" Since ""dax"" and ""wif"" are unique within this example, and they translate to ""green"" and ""red"" respectively, the word ""lug"" must mean ""blue"" here.
- In the second example, ""lug bluf zup"" translates to ""blue blue yellow."" We can assume ""bluf"" and ""zup"" correspond to ""blue"" and ""yellow"" respectively, reinforcing that ""lug"" means ""blue"" as it is translated to ""blue"" in the sequence.
- In the third example, ""zup lug walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue."" ""Zup"" was previously deduced to mean ""yellow."" The word ""lug"" appears once again, translating to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" is a new word which also seems to translate to ""blue."" Since ""walm"" is repeated three times, it's logical to deduce that ""walm"" may introduce replication in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""lug dax wif lug"" translates to ""blue green red blue."" This sequence reinforces the meanings of ""dax"" as ""green,"" ""wif"" as ""red,"" and again suggests that ""lug"" means ""blue,"" as it appears at the beginning and end of the sequence, both times translating to ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" translates to ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue."" Here, ""wif"" translates to ""red"" at the beginning and end, ""lug"" again translates to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color ""yellow,"" further suggesting that ""walm"" may replicate the color before it.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the provided examples, each word appears to correspond to a specific color output. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input. The other words also correlate to specific colors consistently: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" seems to represent ""green."" There is no example provided for ""walm,"" but in the context of the second example where it is preceded by ""dax,"" it results in ""green green green""; this suggests that ""walm"" might be a repetition indicator, although with only one example, this is not a firm rule.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Each instance of ""wif"" in the inputs corresponds to ""red"" in the outputs, irrespective of its position. Other words like ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup"" correspond to other colors but ""wif"" consistently equates to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
From the examples provided, we can induce the following about the nonce word ""zup"":

1. Every instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
2. It does not seem to depend on its position within the sequence or the words that surround it.

Based on this information, we can deduce that:

zup -> yellow

 Rule: Regardless of context or position, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the color outputs following each instance of the word ""bluf.""

- dax bluf -> green green
- lug bluf -> blue blue
- wif bluf -> red red
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow

In each case, ""bluf"" is followed by a color which is a repeat of the color corresponding to the word that comes before ""bluf."" Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the previous word.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in each example.

Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red

Input: lug walm wif
Output: blue blue blue red

Input: wif walm zup walm
Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

In each of these examples, the word that precedes ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output with its respective color:
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and before ""walm,"" it turns into ""blue blue blue.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to red, and before ""walm,"" it turns into ""red red red.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and before ""walm,"" it turns into ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to green, and before ""walm,"" it turns into ""green green green.""

Based on this pattern, it seems that ""walm"" is some sort of function that says to repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the respective color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" directly translates to the color blue in all provided examples.
Based on the examples provided, dax consistently correlates with the output ""green."" Therefore, the meaning of ""dax"" in this context appears to be the color green.

Rule: dax -> green.
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's consider each input and its corresponding output in the given examples. We will try to identify patterns.

1. dax lug wif lug → green blue red blue
   Here ""wif"" appears between two instances of ""lug"" and translates to ""red.""

2. wif lug → red blue
   ""Wif"" precedes ""lug,"" and it is translated as ""red.""

3. lug wif dax bluf wif lug → blue red green green red blue
   ""Wif"" first follows ""lug"" and then precedes ""dax"" and ""lug,"" and in either position, ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

4. zup wif walm → yellow red red red
   ""Wif"" appears between ""zup"" and ""walm,"" and translates as ""red.""

5. wif lug → red blue (repeated example, same translation)

From these examples, we do not see ""wif"" changing meaning based on position or context; it consistently translates to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" as the following:

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
Output: green red green yellow yellow

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow

Input: zup
Output: yellow

Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
Output: yellow yellow red blue green

From the inputs and outputs above, when ""zup"" appears alone, the output is a single ""yellow."" When ""zup"" is paired with other words, regardless of their position relative to ""zup,"" it corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output. Despite the different words that are around ""zup"" and their respective colors, ""zup"" consistently represents ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" when it follows ""wif"" and the color ""blue"" when it follows ""lug"". The examples do not provide a case where ""bluf"" occurs in other contexts, so the rule seems to depend on the word that comes immediately before ""bluf"".

Rule: If ""bluf"" follows the word ""wif,"" it means ""red"". If ""bluf"" follows the word ""lug,"" it means ""blue"".
walm -> repetition. Rule: walm means to repeat the color of the word before it, for a total of three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm lug
    ",Output: red red red blue,red red red blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we will look at the positions and outputs in each example to discover any patterns:

- Input: dax bluf | Output: green green
- Input: zup wif dax walm | Output: yellow red green green green
- Input: dax zup | Output: green yellow
- Input: zup dax lug | Output: yellow green blue
- Input: dax bluf wif lug zup | Output: green green red blue yellow

Now let's find the common factor:

- When ""dax"" appears, the word immediately after it (if there is one) is translated into the color ""green"" in the output.
- Additionally, ""dax"" itself translates to ""green,"" regardless of its position.

So ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"" in the output, and it seems to cause the following word to also become ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green. Additionally, the word following ""dax"" also becomes green. If there is no word following ""dax,"" then it is only the word ""dax"" that translates to green.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color. In every given input, the word ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:
wif -> red
zup -> meaning. Rule: zup translates to the color ""yellow"".
bluf -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to consistently translate to ""blue"". Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the next word to repeat the color output of the word just prior to ""walm."" For instance, when ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" the output color is ""yellow"" both before and after ""walm."" When it comes after ""dax,"" the output color is ""green"" both before and after ""walm."" And when it comes after ""lug,"" the output color is ""blue"" both before and after ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

walm -> causes the next word to repeat the output color of the previous word.

Rule: When ""walm"" is used in sequence between two words, the output color of the word following ""walm"" matches the output color of the word preceding ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the following rule can be induced:

Rule: lug -> blue

Each time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output. Even when combined with other words, such as ""wif lug"" leading to ""red blue,"" ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
Observing the examples given, we can attempt to induct a rule for what ""dax"" means within these specific constructs:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears, the word ""green"" is present in the corresponding output.

2. The example ""dax walm zup"" -> ""green green green yellow"" suggests that ""dax"" might refer to more than one ""green"", depending on its position or the context (since ""walm"" appears to translate to ""green"" as well).

3. However, ""lug dax"" produces ""blue green"", while ""dax wif"" produces ""green red"". 'wif' and 'lug' both give a single color output which suggests that 'dax' might consistently stand for a single 'green'.

Based on these points, a tentative hypothesis for the meaning of ""dax"" can be considered as just ""green"", with the understanding that other words may relate in a sequence to produce repetitions or variations in color patterns.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following mappings for the words:

- zup: yellow
- bluf: red
- dax: green
- wif: red

The presence of the nonce word ""wif"" always results in ""red"" appearing in the output sequence. Regardless of its position in the input (beginning, middle, or end), ""wif"" is consistently mapped to ""red"". The pattern does not seem to be influenced by the surrounding words, which have their own consistent mappings.

Hence, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" from the examples given, let's look for a pattern. 

1. ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue""
2. ""zup bluf dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow green""
3. ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" translates to ""red green red red yellow red""
4. ""lug bluf"" (again) translates to ""blue blue""
5. ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow green yellow green red red""

Here, we can observe that ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes ""bluf"" in the Output text:

- ""lug"" is followed by ""blue""
- ""wif"" is followed by ""red""
- ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow""

Thus, ""bluf"" appears to repeat the color that is directly before it in the input.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color word that immediately precedes it.
walm -> meaning: The meaning of ""walm"" seems to be a repetition of the color word that precedes it.

Rule: Whenever ""walm"" appears in an input, it is followed by a repetition of the color word that comes right before it. Each occurrence of ""walm"" repeats the previous color word three times in the output. Here are the examples supporting the rule:

- In the first input ""dax wif walm,"" ""dax"" means green and ""wif"" means red, with ""walm"" causing ""red"" to be repeated thrice.
- In the second input ""lug wif zup wif walm,"" the colors are blue, red, yellow, and red. After ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated thrice.
- The third and fourth examples demonstrate the same rule with only ""wif"" preceding the ""walm"" and thus red is repeated thrice.
- The fifth example ""zup lug walm"" has ""lug"" (blue) before ""walm,"" leading to ""blue"" being repeated thrice in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow,blue yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds with the output ""red"". There are no instances where ""wif"" maps to any color other than ""red"". Given the data, the rule seems to be quite straightforward.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" correlates with the color ""green"" in every instance except when it follows the word ""lug,"" at which point it represents the color ""blue."" The pattern shows a potential rule based on the position of ""bluf"" and its preceding words. Here is the deduced rule:

Rule: When ""bluf"" appears after ""lug,"" it means blue. Otherwise, ""bluf"" means green.
Based on the examples provided, walm appears to be a modifier that repeats the color of the previous word in the output. When a color is indicated before walm, that same color is repeated in the number of times walm is used. Here's how it translates in each example:

1. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   Explanation: walm follows dax (green), so it repeats ""green"" twice.

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Explanation: walm follows lug (blue), so it repeats ""blue"" twice.

3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Explanation: walm follows wif (red), so it repeats ""red"" twice.
   
4. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   Explanation: walm follows zup (yellow), so it repeats ""yellow"" twice.

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Explanation: walm follows lug (blue), so it repeats ""blue"" twice.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that walm causes the output to repeat the color word before it, for as many times as walm appears.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color in the output as many times as walm appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the outputs. Each instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. No matter where ""dax"" appears in the input sequence, the output is always ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word (including ""zup"") is associated with a specific color. In every instance where ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output. There is no evidence that the meaning of ""zup"" changes based on context, as it consistently maps to ""yellow"" regardless of its position amongst other words or its frequency within a sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided where the nonce word ""bluf"" is used, the output always includes the color ""blue"" followed by a color that corresponds to the prior word or sequence. Here's the analyzed pattern:

1. zup lug bluf zup bluf wif -> yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
2. dax bluf -> green green
3. wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue
4. dax bluf lug wif -> green green blue red
5. lug bluf -> blue blue

In each case, ""bluf"" seems to result in ""blue"" as the first output color, and then the second output color matches the color represented by the word immediately before ""bluf"". For instance, in example 3 ""lug bluf"", ""lug"" translates to blue, and therefore ""bluf"" is followed by another ""blue"".

Rule: bluf -> ""blue"" followed by the color corresponding to the word immediately before it.
Based on the examples provided, it can be observed that the word 'walm' translates to a repetition of a color word in the output. Each instance of 'walm' is followed by a color word being repeated three times. The color that is repeated is not directly provided by the word 'walm' itself but seems to be determined by the word that precedes 'walm'.

- When 'wif' precedes 'walm', the output is 'red red red'.
- When 'zup' precedes 'walm', the output is 'yellow yellow yellow'.
- When 'dax' precedes 'walm', the output is 'green green green'.

Therefore, the meaning of 'walm' appears to be a command to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. If there is no known mapping from the preceding word to a color in a given example, it is not possible to determine the output without further information.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Regardless of its position in the input sentence, ""lug"" always results in ""blue"" in the output.
From the examples provided, the rule seems to be that when the nonce word ""dax"" is used, the output is ""green"":

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, whether it is followed by other words or not, it corresponds to the output ""green"".
- The presence of other words such as ""walm,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" or ""bluf"" corresponds to other colors (""walm"" to green, ""lug"" to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, ""bluf"" to yellow).
- The position of ""dax"" does not seem to matter; it consistently maps to ""green"" whether it is at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of the input.

Therefore, the rule is: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the given examples. Each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output, regardless of the other words present.
Based on the given examples, where ""zup"" is paired with specific outputs, it appears that:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is the color ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, each instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" except when it is preceded by ""dax,"" in which case it corresponds to ""green."" There seem to be two rules at work:

1. When ""bluf"" stands alone or is not preceded by ""dax,"" it translates to ""red.""
2. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" it translates to ""green.""

Therefore, ""bluf"" has conditional meanings:

Rule: 
- If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" then bluf -> green.
- Otherwise, bluf -> red.
walm -> rule. Rule: The word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color of the immediately preceding word. For example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" indicating that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the repetition of ""walm"" repeats the color ""red"" twice more. Similarly, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" showing that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" repeats the color ""yellow"" two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the input contains the word 'lug,' the output corresponds to the color 'blue'.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we examine the output associated with each instance of ""dax"" in the provided examples. It appears that ""dax"" always corresponds to the output ""green.""

Here are the observations:

1. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" regardless of their order as seen in the first and fourth examples.
2. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green"" (second and fifth examples).
3. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green"" (third example, which also confirms that ""dax"" is ""green"" when it is the second word).
4. ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" as in the second example, and ""dax"" is ""green"" when it follows ""bluf.""

Based on these observations, we can rule out that ""dax"" is dependent on the position or the context. Instead, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Every time ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" is part of the corresponding output. It doesn't appear to have any dependency on context or the position within the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Regardless of the context or other words around it, whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""red."" Here are the corresponding inputs and outputs that lead to this conclusion:

- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" where ""wif"" and ""bluf"" both correspond to ""red.""
- ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""red.""
- ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" translates to ""green green red yellow blue,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" to ""red,"" ""wif"" back to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
- ""wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" back to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
- ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" back to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> red
Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word. 

Explanation: In each example, ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word that comes before ""walm"" to be repeated an additional number of times. 

For instance:
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"", meaning ""walm"" causes ""green"" (which corresponds to ""dax"") to be repeated two more times.
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"", meaning ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" (which corresponds to ""zup"") to be repeated two more times. 

Each time ""walm"" appears, the rule of repeating the color corresponding to the previous word is applied.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax walm lug
    ",Output: blue green green green blue blue blue,blue green green green blue,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" always directly corresponds to the single output ""blue."" It is independent of position within the input sequence and the presence of other words. Thus, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Every time ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green.""
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at how it alters the output in each example.

- When ""wif"" follows ""lug,"" the output color sequence includes ""red.""
- When ""wif"" follows ""zup,"" the output color sequence includes ""red.""
- When ""wif"" stands alone before a word, it outputs ""red"" before the color associated with the following word.

Therefore, it seems that ""wif"" adds a ""red"" before the color associated with the word that follows it. If ""wif"" is the first word followed by another word, the output will start with ""red"" and then the color corresponding to the next word.

Rule: wif -> meaning. ""Wif"" means to add the color ""red"" before the next color in the sequence.
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be associated with the output ""red red"" consistently when it follows the word ""wif"" and with ""green"" when it stands alone or follows other words. Here are the observations from the examples:

Input: wif bluf dax  
Output: red red green  
- ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red red"", ""dax"" gives ""green""

Input: dax bluf  
Output: green green  
- ""dax"" gives ""green"", ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and still gives ""green""

Input: lug dax bluf  
Output: blue green green  
- ""lug"" gives ""blue"", ""dax"" gives ""green"", and ""bluf"" still gives ""green""

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf  
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red  
- ""zup"" gives ""yellow"", ""lug"" gives ""blue"", ""walm"" is unknown but not immediately relevant to ""bluf"", ""dax"" gives ""green"", ""wif bluf"" gives ""red red""

Input: dax lug wif bluf  
Output: green blue red red  
- ""dax"" gives ""green"", ""lug"" gives ""blue"", ""wif bluf"" gives ""red red""

Looking at these patterns, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it translates to ""red"" when it immediately follows the word ""wif"" and to ""green"" in other contexts.

Rule:   
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", it results in ""red red"".
- When ""bluf"" does not follow ""wif"", it results in ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

In each Output, the word ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of the color ""red."" Let's examine the occurrences:

1. In the first example, ""dax wif walm lug zup walm,"" the word ""walm"" follows ""wif"" both times, and it results in a sequence of ""red red red,"" followed by another color after ""lug"" and ""zup,"" and then ""walm"" repeats the ""red"" sequence.

2. In the second example, ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" the word ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" and ""wif,"" resulting in a ""green green green"" followed by ""red red red,"" indicating ""walm"" carries over the color before it in a sequence of three.

3. The third and fourth examples reinforce this pattern, each time ""walm"" appears, it extends the sequence of the preceding color by three more instances.

4. In the fifth example, ""zup walm lug,"" ""walm"" again extends the ""yellow"" sequence by repeating it three more times before changing color after ""lug.""

From these observations, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be that it extends the sequence of the preceding color by repeating it three additional times.

Rule: walm -> extends the preceding color by repeating it three more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" appears to be consistent. In both isolated and combined instances with other words, ""lug"" is translated to the same word in the output. Here's the rule deduced from the inputs and outputs:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word translates to a specific color:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> green
- walm -> yellow
- wif -> red

From this, it can be deduced that the word ""dax"" directly translates to the color ""green,"" independent of its position in the input.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" directly translates to the color ""red."" 

Here's how the rule is deduced from the examples given:

1. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
2. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
3. wif walm -> red red red
4. wif -> red
5. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow

In each case, the presence of ""wif"" in the input corresponds directly to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string. In the first example, ""wif"" is in the middle and translates to ""red""; in the third and fourth examples, ""wif"" is at the beginning or present alone, yet it also translates to ""red"" or begins the output with ""red""; and in the fifth example, ""wif"" is close to the end and still translates to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> ""yellow""

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the other words' positions or meanings.
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to associate the nonce word ""bluf"" with a doubling of the color that corresponds to the word that comes before it.

Here are the observations:

- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" therefore ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" is causing the duplication of ""red.""
- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" meaning ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" duplicates it.
- The sequence ""wif bluf dax"" ends with ""green,"" providing an association for ""dax"" with ""green"" but no direct association with ""bluf.""
- The sequence ""wif bluf lug"" ends with ""blue,"" associating ""lug"" with ""blue,"" but again, the presence of ""bluf"" doesn't directly translate to ""blue.""

Given these observations, the examples suggest that ""bluf"" functions as a rule to duplicate the color associated with the word that comes directly before it.

Rule: bluf -> duplicate the previous color.
walm -> repeat the previous color. Rule: When you see the word 'walm', repeat the color that was just translated before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup wif zup
    ",Output: yellow red yellow,yellow red yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently results in the color ""blue"" in the Output. Regardless of the other words present (like ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup""), ""lug"" always translates to ""blue.""

So according to the examples:

lug -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: ""lug"" means ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples given, whenever the input includes the word 'dax,' the corresponding output is 'green.' There is a consistent one-to-one correspondence between 'dax' and 'green' across all provided examples.
Based on the inputs and outputs provided, we can observe the following patterns:

- When ""wif"" is the only input, the output is ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is immediately followed by another word, the output starts with ""red,"" followed by other colors depending on the word that comes after ""wif.""
- The word after ""wif"" seems to determine the color that follows ""red."" For example, ""walm"" results in ""red red red,"" and ""lug"" results in ""red blue.""

From this, we can deduce:

wif -> meaning: The word ""wif"" seems to represent the color ""red.""

Rule: When ""wif"" is present in the input, the output will always start with the color ""red,"" followed by other colors that are determined by the subsequent words in the input string. If ""wif"" is stand-alone, the output is exclusively ""red.""
Given the examples provided, we can deduce that each word in the input corresponds to a particular color in the output. The word ""zup"" seems to consistently produce the color ""yellow"" irrespective of its position in the sequence. Thus, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" directly translates to the color ""blue."" By inspecting the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can ascertain the following consistent mappings:

- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""bluf"" -> blue

Therefore, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> blue.
Based on the examples given, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to the output of three repeated colors. To determine what color ""walm"" stands for, we should look at the examples where ""walm"" is surrounded by known words/colors and see what triplet of colors is in the output when ""walm"" is in the input:

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Explanation: Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and the output is three yellows following ""zup"", ""walm"" in this context causes a repetition of the color mentioned before it.

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green
Explanation: Here, when ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the output is three greens, mirroring the color that ""dax"" stands for. Therefore, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
Explanation: ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and after ""lug walm"", there are three blues in the output sequence. This supports the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color tied to the preceding word.

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
Explanation: ""Dax"" is associated with ""green"", and after ""dax walm"", there are three greens in the output. 

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Explanation: Again, after ""dax"" which stands for ""green"", ""walm"" produces three greens.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to repeat three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the outputs. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: lug -> ""blue""
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in all given examples.
Based on the examples provided, the pattern is quite clear. Each time the word ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""red."" Therefore, we can deduce that ""bluf"" translates to ""red."" Here is the rule reflecting this pattern:

Rule: bluf -> red
walm -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word. Rule: Whenever ""walm"" follows a word, the color associated with that word is repeated three times. If the sequence is followed by ""wif,"" then ""red"" is added to the end.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" based on the provided examples.
dax -> green. 

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the outputs.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let us break down each group of inputs against their respective outputs to extract the possible rules that apply:

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green
- Here, ""wif"" appears twice and precedes the colors red and red.

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red
- ""Wif"" precedes red here again.

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
- ""Wif"" precedes a series of red colors, with one extra red compared to ""bluf.""

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
- ""Wif"" is followed by red, similar to prior patterns.

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- ""Wif"" is followed by a series of red colors, and ""walm"" appears to add more reds.

From these examples, it is observable that the word ""wif"" is always followed by the color red in the output. The word following ""wif"" seems to determine the number of times red appears or possibly affects the color that comes after red, depending on the input. However, there seems to be a consistent rule that ""wif"" translates to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red. 

This means ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the examples provided.
Based on the examples provided, we can observe a pattern in which each word corresponds to a color, and the position of the word ""zup"" within the sequence always results in the color ""yellow."" Therefore, the meaning of ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples, we can see a pattern where the word 'bluf' always seems to correspond to the output 'green'. There is no immediate evidence that 'bluf' changes meaning depending on the context; it appears to be consistent across all examples. Hence, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> green.
Analyzing the input and output sequences:

- In the second and fifth examples, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" as seen consistently across the first three examples.
- Finally, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" which is evident from the third and fourth examples.

Looking at the correspondence, one color is added for each time ""walm"" is mentioned in sequence. Additionally, the color added appears to match the color assigned to the word right after ""walm."" Therefore, it seems like ""walm"" repeats the color of the next word in the sequence thrice.

Definition based on the given examples:
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the following word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each occurrence of ""lug"" in the input is translated to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, we can infer the following:
- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"".
- The word ""dax"" does not depend on its position in the sequence to determine its color output.
- The presence of other words (like ""zup"" or ""wif"") in the input sequence does not change the output color associated with ""dax"".

Therefore, the rule can be written as:

Rule: dax -> green

This means that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position or the context in which it is used.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in all of the provided examples, regardless of context or position in the input sequence.
Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> two repetitions of the preceding color.
Based on the inputs and corresponding outputs provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be influenced by the word that precedes it. Here is the breakdown for each instance where ""walm"" occurs:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow."" The word ""zup"" by itself corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" here seems to act as a repeater of the previous color.

2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and the output is ""blue blue,"" suggesting the same repeater behavior.

3. In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" again, and the output repeats the color ""yellow.""

4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" once more, and the output is ""blue blue,"" consistent with prior observations.

5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" appears twice, first following ""wif"" and producing ""red red,"" then after ""zup"" producing ""yellow yellow yellow.""

From these observations, the inferred rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color of the word that comes before it in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> ""Repeat the color of the preceding word""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position or the other words around it.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Each occurrence of ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green,"" no matter the position or context within the given examples.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the output includes the word ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
Based on the given examples, zup correlates with the output ""yellow"" consistently. Subsequent words and their related outputs appear to be:

- ""dax"" -> green
- ""walm"" -> a series of ""green"" lengthened by the number of letters in ""walm"" (4 letters -> green green green green)
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""lug"" -> blue

So, the output color seems to directly depend on the input words, with ""zup"" always resulting in the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to correlate with the color ""red"" in every instance it appears in the output. However, there are instances where ""bluf"" is also associated with the color ""blue."" Hence, there might be a pattern based on the position of ""bluf"" among other words that determines when it is interpreted as ""red"" or ""blue.""

Let's analyze:

1. When ""bluf"" appears after ""lug"" (e.g., ""lug bluf""), the output is ""blue blue.""
2. When ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" or at the end of a sequence, the output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""
3. When ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""

Considering these patterns, ""bluf"" seems to take on the color represented by the previous word, except when it follows ""lug"" where it seems to produce ""blue.""

If we seek to generalize the rule:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the word that precedes it. It takes on the color represented by the preceding word unless it follows ""lug,"" in which case it represents ""blue.""

So the rule would be:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word before it; if preceded by ""lug,"" it means ""blue.""
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the immediately preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Based on the given examples, each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". Every instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output, regardless of the surrounding words. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Regardless of the other words surrounding ""zup"", the presence of ""zup"" always results in ""yellow"" appearing in the same position in the output. Therefore, we can deduce that:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, it translates to ""yellow"" in the output.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the outputs to repeat the color associated with the word that appears immediately before it. 

For example:
- ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red"" (wif corresponds to red)
- ""lug bluf"" leads to ""blue blue"" (lug corresponds to blue)
- ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow"" (zup corresponds to yellow)

Therefore, the rule is:
bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.
walm -> repetition of the preceding color.

Rule: The word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word in the input. The number of repetitions is ultimately dependent on the specific color. For example:
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green"" being said three times.
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow"" being said three times.
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red"" being said three times.

- The presence of other words before ""dax"" leads to additional colors in the output before ""green.""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

- ""zup"" after ""dax"" translates to ""yellow.""
- The order of the words in the input corresponds to the order of the colors in the output.
Rule: wif -> red

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in a sequence of words.
Based on the given examples, ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that comes directly before it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

For example:
- In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" also corresponds to green.
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""bluf"" also corresponds to red.
- In ""wif bluf dax,"" ""dax"" follows after ""bluf,"" but because ""bluf"" is directly after ""wif,"" it still corresponds to red. The last ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- In ""lug dax bluf wif dax,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" after ""dax"" also corresponds to green, followed by ""wif"" with red and another ""dax"" with green.
To deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" we shall look at how it operates within different sequences and the output it is associated with. After inspecting all inputs and corresponding outputs, it appears that the word ""walm"" consistently translates to three repetitions of the color that corresponds to the word that comes before it. Here is the breakdown of the examples provided:

- In the first example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which means ""walm"" takes the color associated with ""zup"" and repeats it three times.

- The second example, ""wif walm dax zup,"" leads to ""red red red green yellow."" Here again, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the color ""red"" associated with ""wif"" is repeated three times.

- The pattern continues with ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" resulting in ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red,"" where the ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times.

- ""Dax walm wif zup"" outputs ""green green green red yellow,"" with ""walm"" translating the color associated with ""dax,"" green, into three repetitions.

- Finally, ""zup wif lug zup walm"" yields ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow,"" where the final ""walm"" turns the preceding ""zup"" (yellow) into three yellows.

Walm Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it generates three consecutive repetitions of the color associated with the preceding word.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:
walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in all provided examples.
Based on the provided examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" is present, the word ""green"" appears in the output.
- The appearance of ""dax"" does not appear to be position-dependent, meaning it maps to ""green"" regardless of where it appears in the input sequence.
- Other words in the examples (""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" ""walm"") correspond to different colors, and these mappings are consistent regardless of the presence of ""dax.""

Using these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> ""green""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red"". In every output, the mention of ""wif"" corresponds to the color red being included. The rule does not appear to change regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input string.

Therefore, the definition based on the given examples is as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should examine the relationship between the input and the output, identifying the pattern for the word ""bluf"" as well as the surrounding words that repeat in various examples.

Analyzing the Outputs:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- Whenever ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue.""
- Whenever ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""

Now we examine the correlation with ""bluf"":

1. When ""wif bluf dax lug"" is the input, the output is ""red red green blue."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" but we know ""wif"" already corresponds to ""red.""
2. When ""wif bluf"" is the input, the output is ""red red."" Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" but it is directly following a ""wif,"" which also means ""red.""
3. When ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" is the input, the output is ""blue green green yellow blue red."" Here, ""bluf"" precedes ""zup"" and corresponds to ""green,"" just like ""dax.""
4. When ""zup dax bluf"" is the input, the output is ""yellow green green."" Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""
5. When ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" is the input, the output is ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, it seems that the rule for ""bluf"" is that it repeats the color of the word just before it. 

Rule: bluf -> ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color of the previous word.""
Based on the examples provided, walm seems to be a word that repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Breaking down the examples:

1. lug walm -> blue blue blue (lug corresponds to blue)
2. dax walm zup walm -> green green green yellow yellow yellow (dax corresponds to green, zup to yellow)
3. zup walm dax zup dax wif -> yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red (walm repeats the color of zup, which is yellow, and so on)
4. zup lug walm wif walm -> yellow blue blue blue red red red (lug corresponds to blue, making walm repeat blue three times, and similarly for wif with red)
5. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue (walm first repeats the color for wif which is red, and lastly for lug which is blue)

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" There are no varying contexts or additional modifying conditions that seem to affect this relationship. Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" seems to correspond to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word zup corresponds to the color yellow.
Rule: bluf -> the color word that precedes it. If there is no color word before it, it repeats the color word that follows it.
From the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" results in repeating the color word that comes before it, three times. Here are the observations:

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" seems to repeat ""yellow"" two more times.
- ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue"". ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" two more times.
- ""zup dax lug walm zup"" results in ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow"". Each non-""walm"" word corresponds to a color, and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" (the color associated with ""lug"") two more times.
- ""lug walm dax"" results in ""blue blue blue green"". ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" two more times, then ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- ""zup walm wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow red"". ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" two more times, and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Based on these observations, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" is:

2. Input: dax lug bluf wif → Output: green blue blue red
3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug → Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
4. Input: lug dax → Output: blue green
5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup → Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

From these examples, it can be noted:

- Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.
- ""lug"" does not appear to modify adjacent words as the same word pairs do not consistently cause changes in the output colors. For example:
    ""dax lug"" in the second and fourth inputs both lead to ""green blue.""
    ""wif lug"" in the first input leads to ""red blue.""
    
Given this consistent appearance of ""blue"" following ""lug"", we can deduce that ""lug"" translates directly to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the given examples.
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" is present, output ""yellow."" The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of the context.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the outputs associated with each example and identify the patterns.

In the first example, ""wif bluf"" resulted in ""green red red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" could be related to the color red. However, in subsequent examples, ""bluf"" does not always translate to just ""red."" It seems to repeat the color that comes directly before it. 

- In the first input, ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green red red,"" so ""bluf"" translates to the color that ""wif"" corresponds to, which is red.
- In the second input, ""bluf wif"" corresponds to ""yellow red red,"" so once again, ""bluf"" takes on the color before it, yellow, followed by ""wif's"" corresponding color, red.
- In the third input, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" implying ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""dax,"" which is green.
- In the fourth input, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" so ""bluf"" mimics the preceding color, which was yellow.
- In the fifth input, ""dax bluf"" again results in ""green green,"" showing that ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with ""dax.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
Analyzing the provided examples, I notice that the word ""walm"" influences the color that follows it rather than corresponding to a color itself. It seems to cause the next color to repeat the color that precedes ""walm."" Here is the pattern I observe:

1. ""zup walm lug"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" ""Walm"" precedes ""lug,"" which then results in ""yellow,"" the same color as ""zup.""
2. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" turns into ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red."" Here, ""walm"" precedes another ""zup,"" resulting in ""blue,"" which is the color for ""lug.""
3. ""zup walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red."" Again, ""walm"" precedes ""lug,"" repeated as ""yellow.""
4. ""wif walm dax zup"" turns into ""red red red green yellow."" ""Walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" and red is repeated.
5. ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red."" After ""walm"" there is no other word, but the pattern of repeating the previous color still holds true.

Rule:
walm -> causes the next color to repeat the color that precedes ""walm."" If there's no color after ""walm,"" it repeats the last mentioned color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: From the examples provided, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""dax"" translates directly to the color ""green"".

dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: Regardless of the position of the word ""zup"" in a sequence, it is consistently translated to the color ""yellow.""
Given the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color that is the output of the word immediately preceding it (if there is one). Each unique word (zup, lug, dax, wif) maps to a color (yellow, blue, green, red respectively), and ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it. If ""bluf"" appears at the beginning with no preceding word, there is no color output provided, as there’s no previous color to repeat.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word immediately before it.
Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the pattern related to the word ""walm"" and its corresponding output. Upon examination, it appears that ""walm"" is consistently translated to the color ""green."" Additionally, ""walm"" causes the color before it to be repeated for every occurrence of ""walm.""

Let's break down each example to demonstrate this:

- In the first example, ""lug dax walm"" translates to ""blue green green green."" The color before ""walm"" is ""green"" (corresponding to ""dax""), and it's repeated three times, indicating that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the preceding color.
  
- In the second example, ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" translates to ""blue green yellow green green green red."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" and ""green"" is repeated three times again after ""walm,"" consistent with the rule.

- In the third example, ""dax walm zup lug dax"" gives ""green green green yellow blue green."" Once again, ""green"" is repeated twice after ""walm.""

- For the fourth example, ""zup walm lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" so ""yellow"" is repeated after ""walm.""

- Finally, in the last example, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue green red blue red."" Here again, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (""blue""), and ""blue"" is repeated after ""walm.""

Given the evidence from the examples, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" multiple times, depending on the number of occurrences of ""walm"". 

In other words, ""walm"" itself translates to the immediate preceding color and causes that color to repeat.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" whenever it appears in the input.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the list of words.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of context.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in every example given.
bluf -> repeats the color associated with the word preceding it. Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes the color assigned to the previous word and outputs it twice. 

- In the examples ""lug bluf"" and ""wif bluf"", the colors (""blue"" for lug and ""red"" for wif) are simply repeated twice.
- In the example ""zup bluf lug zup,"" ""bluf"" takes the color associated with ""lug"" (which is ""blue"") and repeats it before going back to ""zup"", which is ""yellow.""
- In the example ""dax wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""wif,"" (which is ""red"") even if there is another word (""dax"") before ""wif"".
walm -> three repetitions of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" appears in a sequence, it signifies that the color associated with the preceding word should be repeated three times in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in the outputs. Thus, it would be reasonable to induce that ""dax"" means green.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output, and the position of ""wif"" in the input does not change the corresponding output color. Additionally, ""wif"" alone produces ""red"" without any other color. Therefore, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in every instance it appears.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.""
walm -> repeat the colour of the previous word two more times.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears after a colour-associated word (like ""zup"" for yellow or ""lug"" for blue), the output colour of that word is repeated an additional two times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output.
Based on the presented examples, we can attempt to determine the meaning of the word ""dax."" Let's analyze the contexts in which ""dax"" appears and the corresponding outputs:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
2. ""Dax"" does not seem to be dependent on its position in the input sequence, as it consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of whether it appears at the beginning, middle, or end of the sequence.

Here are the rules extracted from the inputs and outputs provided:

- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""green""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""

Now let's apply this to the word ""dax"":

- ""dax"" alone translates to ""green""
- ""dax"" in the sequence ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" translates to ""green,"" just as ""bluf"" does.
- ""dax bluf"" both words translate to ""green green""
- No matter the position of ""dax,"" it always translates to ""green""

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each instance where ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of zup in the input corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following:

- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""

When the word ""bluf"" appears after another word, the output is the same color name as the word that came before it. This pattern holds true across all examples given. Therefore, it suggests the rule that ""bluf"" is a repeat function for the last color mentioned.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correlate with repeating the last color mentioned in the output sequence and extending it by a certain number of times. Analyzing example by example:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, and the sequence of green is extended by two more occurrences.

2. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   Here ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) first and extends red by two more occurrences. Then, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and extends yellow by two more occurrences.

3. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and extends red by two more occurrences.

4. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and extends blue by two more occurrences.

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and extends blue by two more occurrences.

Based on these observations, the rule associated with ""walm"" appears to be that it extends the last color mentioned by two additional occurrences.

Rule: walm -> Extend the last color mentioned by two additional occurrences.
