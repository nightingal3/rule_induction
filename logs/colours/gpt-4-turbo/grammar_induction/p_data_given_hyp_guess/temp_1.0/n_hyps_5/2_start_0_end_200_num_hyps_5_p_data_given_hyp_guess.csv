"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". Therefore, whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to ""blue"" in the output.

lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. This can be deduced by noting that every time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples given, it appears that the word ""wif"" translates to the word ""red"". Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. For each occurrence of ""wif,"" there is a corresponding ""red"" in the output sequence.

wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow in the outputs, regardless of the surrounding context or sequence of the words in the input.
From the examples provided, we can observe that the word ""bluf"" seems to translate into a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word just before it. Here is the breakdown:

- ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red"", where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" results in another ""red"".
- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"", where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""bluf"" results in another ""green"".
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"", following the same pattern as before.
- ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green red green yellow yellow""; the last word ""bluf"" results in another ""yellow"", which corresponds to ""zup"".
- ""lug bluf wif"" translates to ""blue blue red""; the word before ""bluf"" is ""lug"" (blue) and is thus followed by another ""blue"" because of ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color that corresponds to the previous word.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns or rules within the examples provided that relate to the usage of the word ""walm"" and the corresponding outputs. 

By examining the examples, let's consider the position of the word ""walm"" and the colors that follow:

1. dax walm wif zup -> green green green red yellow
2. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
3. zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow green blue
4. lug wif lug walm zup walm wif -> blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
5. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow

From the above examples, we can look for patterns related to the word ""walm"":
- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output color for ""walm"" is green.
- In example 2, ""walm"" is at the end, and the output for ""walm"" is red.
- In example 3, ""walm"" is after ""zup"" and before ""dax,"" and the output color for ""walm"" is yellow.
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" in two instances. After the first ""lug,"" the output color for ""walm"" is blue. After the second ""lug"" and ""zup,"" the color for ""walm"" is blue and then yellow, respectively.
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup,"" with the output color being green and then yellow.

Based on these examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color of the preceding word:

- When preceded by ""dax,"" the color green is repeated (""walm"" follows ""dax"").
- When preceded by ""zup,"" the color yellow is repeated (""walm"" follows ""zup"").
- When preceded by ""lug,"" the color blue is repeated (""walm"" follows ""lug"").

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the word that comes directly before it.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color output of the word before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax
    ",Output: red green,red green,True,0
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the outputs. Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output, suggesting that ""lug"" means blue.
dax -> green. Rule: The word dax corresponds to the color green in every instance provided.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, the pattern suggests that ""zup"" has a consistent meaning across all instances. Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow."" There is no context given that alters the meaning of ""zup,"" and there are no additional rules provided that would change its output in different situations. Therefore, the rule deduced is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue.""
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we can compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   Rule Observations:
   - ""dax"" corresponds with ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds with ""red""
   Given that ""walm"" is between two known color outputs, it corresponds with ""blue.""
   
2. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   Rule Observations:
   - ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow"" at both the beginning and the end
   - ""dax"" corresponds with ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue""
   It's confirmed that ""walm"" corresponds with ""blue"" again, as it follows ""lug"" which also corresponds with ""blue.""
   
3. Input: lug walm zup walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
   Rule Observations:
   - ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow""
   The pattern holds: ""walm"" corresponds with ""blue"" as it follows ""lug"" and precedes ""zup.""
   
4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Rule Observations:
   - ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow""
   With only ""zup"" and ""walm"" present and all outputs being ""yellow,"" this example suggests that ""walm"" independently corresponds to ""yellow.""
   
5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Rule Observations:
   - ""dax"" corresponds with ""green""
   Similarly, with only ""dax"" and ""walm"" present and all outputs being ""green,"" this example suggests that ""walm"" independently corresponds to ""green.""

Combining these observations, we derive the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. If ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it is green. If ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it is blue. If ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it is yellow. So the meaning of ""walm"" is relative to its preceding word and not a fixed color.

walm -> meaning. Rule: ""walm"" replicates the color of the word that precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup
    ",Output: red yellow,red yellow,True,1
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" across all examples.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently correlates with the output ""green."" When ""dax"" is used in combination with another word, such as ""lug,"" it appears to add the meaning of ""green"" to the sequence, as seen in the output ""blue green"" where ""lug"" may correspond to ""blue.""

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look for patterns where the word ""wif"" appears in the examples and see how it affects the output.

- In the first example, inserting ""wif"" between ""dax lug walm dax"" and ""bluf dax"" changes the pattern of colors from ""green blue blue blue"" to ""green red red green"".
- In the second example, after ""dax lug"" which resulted in ""green blue,"" when ""wif"" is added, we get ""red.""
- In the third example, after ""zup walm"" which resulted in ""yellow yellow,"" when ""wif"" is added, we get ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif zup"" directly translates to ""red yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif walm dax"" leads to ""red red red green.""

Looking at these examples, we can observe that every time ""wif"" is introduced, the color ""red"" is the next output, regardless of the previous pattern. The word that follows ""wif"" then resumes the color sequence that would have followed if ""wif"" had not been there.

Rule: wif -> introduces the color ""red"" in the sequence, regardless of the previous colors.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Every instance of ""zup"" in the input is translated to ""yellow"" in the output.
Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that follows it. If ""bluf"" is the last word, it defaults to the color red.

Examples:
1. In ""lug bluf wif,"" ""bluf"" becomes blue because the following word is ""wif"" -> blue.
2. In ""zup bluf dax,"" ""bluf"" becomes yellow because the following word is ""dax"" -> yellow.
3. In ""wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" is red by default since it is the last word and there is no following word to take the color from.
4. In ""zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" becomes yellow because ""zup"" indicates yellow.
5. In ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax,"" ""bluf"" becomes red because the word following it is ""zup"" -> yellow, and there are subsequent color assignments that affect ""wif"" and ""lug,"" indicating that the color assignment for ""bluf"" depends only on the immediate next word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", we need to look at the patterns in the input and their corresponding output colors, systematically excluding other variables to isolate the effect of ""walm.""

Here are the examples to consider:

1. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
2. lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red
3. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue

Let's analyze the outputs where ""walm"" appears to determine its rule. Looking through the examples, we notice that every time ""walm"" appears, it triggers a sequence of the same color.

- In example 1, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" and both produce the sequence ""red red red.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" ends the sequence, and it results in a set of three red outputs.
- In example 3, ""walm"" is followed by two different words (""wif"" and ""lug""), but it produces a sequence of ""blue blue blue.""
- In example 4, ""walm"" is the last word, and it produces ""green green green.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and both generate ""blue blue blue.""

The common pattern is that ""walm"" seems to create a sequence of three identical colors in the output, where the color seems to be determined by the preceding word. The sequences are as follows:

- ""wif walm"" -> red red red
- ""lug walm"" -> blue blue blue
- ""dax walm"" -> green green green

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color output of the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,2
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in all given examples.
Given the examples, it seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words in the input.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we can examine the patterns of inputs to outputs:

In every example, the presence of ""wif"" corresponds to the output starting with ""red."" Let's examine the position of ""wif"" and the subsequent colors:

1. wif dax -> red green
2. (dax walm) wif bluf -> green green green red red
3. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
4. wif (walm dax) -> red red red green
5. zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green

From these examples, we can formulate the following observations:

- ""Wif"" is not dependent on its position in the input for its corresponding output, as seen in examples 1, 4, and 5 where it appears in different positions but still results in ""red"".
- ""Wif"" does not necessarily dictate the color outputs that follow. It seems that other words (like dax, walm, and bluf) impact the color sequence. However, whenever ""wif"" is present, ""red"" is always the first color in the output sequence.

Given these observations, we can induce that the nonce word ""wif"" indicates the start of a new color sequence starting with ""red."" But the subsequent colors depend on the following words, not on ""wif.""

Rule: wif -> initiates a new color sequence starting with ""red""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the commonalities and differences between the examples:

- When ""dax zup bluf"" is input, the output is ""green yellow yellow."" When ""zup bluf"" is input without ""dax,"" the output is ""yellow yellow."" This suggests that ""bluf"" might not be related to ""green,"" considering ""green"" is the response to ""dax.""

- ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red,"" which implies that ""bluf"" must correspond to ""red"" in this context.

- The phrase ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" outputs ""yellow yellow blue green blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" here since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

- Finally, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" gives ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""; ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" in this sequence despite ""lug"" also representing blue. Therefore, there doesn't seem to be a direct color association with ""bluf.""

Looking through the examples, ""bluf"" corresponds to different colors depending on its context or surrounding words. Now, let's note the patterns:

- ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" both times it follows ""zup.""
- ""bluf"" results in ""red"" when it follows ""wif.""
- The colors produced by other words (""dax"" -> green, ""lug"" -> blue, ""zup"" -> yellow) appear to be consistent regardless of their placement relative to ""bluf.""

Since ""bluf"" does not have a consistent color association, we infer that ""bluf"" is a rule or function that changes its output based on contextual keywords (like ""zup"" or ""wif"") rather than translating directly into a color. 

Here is the rule underlying ""bluf"" based on the current examples:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it.

As such:

- Following ""zup"" (yellow), ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow.""
- Following ""wif"" (red), ""bluf"" outputs ""red.""
- The availability of ""dax"" or ""lug"" before or after ""bluf"" is not affecting its association with the preceding color.

Thus:
bluf -> meaning. Bluf repeats the color of the previous word.
walm -> the preceding color repeated three times.

Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""walm"" follows a color-indicating word, the output is the same color word repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

    ",Output: red green green,red green green,True,3
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the inputs and outputs given, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Every instance where the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the same position in the output. For other words, ""dax"" seems consistently linked to ""green,"" ""bluf"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" With the limited information about ""lug,"" it appears once and is translated to ""blue.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow', regardless of its position or context within the input sequence.
bluf -> meaning. Bluf indicates repetition of the color associated with the word just before it.

Rule: If a color word is followed by ""bluf"", then the color word's corresponding color is repeated once. If ""bluf"" is the last word in the sequence, it repeats the color corresponding to the word just before it twice.
Observing the examples given and how the word ""walm"" affects the output, we notice that each time ""walm"" is introduced, the output color sequence starts to repeat what immediately precedes ""walm"" until a new color or ""walm"" appears in the sequence.

For instance:

- In the first example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", and ""lug"" produces ""blue"". After ""walm"", ""blue"" repeats until ""wif"" which changes the sequence to ""yellow red"".
- In the second example, ""wif"" leads to ""red"". When ""walm"" is introduced, ""red"" repeats until ""zup"", which changes the output to ""yellow"", which then continues until ""lug"" changes it to ""blue"". ""Wif"" then leads back to ""red"", and ""walm"" follows, continuing the ""red"" sequence.
- In the third example, ""zup"" preceding ""walm"" translates to ""yellow"", and after ""walm"", ""yellow"" repeats until ""lug"" changes it.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" before ""walm"" results in ""green"", and ""walm"" leads to a repetition of ""green"" until ""zup"" changes the output.
- In the last example, ""dax"" is outputted as ""green"", then ""zup"" as ""yellow"" and after the second ""dax"" produces ""green"" again, ""walm"" follows and the ""green"" repeats.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes a repetition of the output color that directly precedes it, continuing this repetition until a new cue is given to change the color.

Rule: walm -> causes a repeat of the color output that directly precedes it until it changes by a subsequent cue.

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in all given examples.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" It does not seem to change meaning based on position or surrounding words. Given this, the rule appears to be quite straightforward:

Rule: dax -> green

This suggests that ""dax"" means ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds with the color ""red"" in the output. Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" is:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position in a sequence. Therefore, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color yellow in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems like the nonce word ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word that proceeds it. However, when ""bluf"" precedes any words, it defaults to the color value of the immediately following word. Here's the rule induction based on the given inputs and outputs:

- ""lug wif lug bluf"" turned to ""blue red blue blue"" means ""bluf"" took the color value of ""lug,"" which is blue.
- ""dax bluf"" became ""green green,"" suggesting ""bluf"" took the color value of ""dax,"" which is green.
- ""dax bluf wif zup"" became ""green green red yellow,"" indicating ""bluf"" followed ""dax"" and thus took its green color value.
- ""zup bluf dax"" turned to ""yellow yellow green,"" implying that ""bluf"" took on the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow when it came before ""dax.""
- ""lug wif bluf"" became ""blue red red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" takes the color value of the word following it (in this case, ""wif"") when it does not precede any color value (i.e., in the absence of a preceding color indicator).

Rule:
bluf -> the color value of the word immediately before it if there is one, otherwise the color value of the word immediately after it.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Each instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
Rule: dax -> green

In every example provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in the output. There seems to be no variance in the association regardless of the words that precede or follow ""dax."" Therefore, we can conclude that ""dax"" means green.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine the contextual patterns where it appears. We'll see how the position of ""wif"" relates to the output colors:

1. dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""red red red"".
   
2. dax lug wif
   Output: green blue red
   Here, ""wif"" is at the end and yields ""red"".
   
3. lug dax wif lug
   Output: blue green red blue
   Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"".
   
4. wif dax lug dax
   Output: red green blue green
   Here, ""wif"" is at the beginning and yields ""red"".
   
5. zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   Here, ""wif"" is at the end and yields ""red"".

Based on these examples, whenever ""wif"" appears, regardless of its position, the output color is ""red"". There is no pattern indicating that the meaning changes with position or context within the given data set. 

Therefore, the rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the term ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. To illustrate:

- ""zup bluf"" resulted in ""yellow yellow,"" which indicates that the word ""bluf"" took on the color associated with ""zup.""
- ""dax bluf"" produced ""green green,"" showing that ""bluf"" adopted the color associated with ""dax.""
- In ""wif bluf dax lug,"" ""bluf"" followed ""wif"" and the output was ""red red,"" further confirming that ""bluf"" is taking the color of the preceding word.
- The sequence ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" gave ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red,"" which reinforces the pattern, as ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and then ""zup,"" taking on their associated colors respectively.

Therefore, the rule for what ""bluf"" means in this context is:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
walm -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" causes the following word to be repeated three times, with its corresponding color translated from the given word to color mapping. For example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" thus ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" within these examples appears to be repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it, three times.

Rule: Walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or context within the given examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at the relationship between the input and the output in each example. Let's analyze:

1. Input: dax lug bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" at both the beginning and the end.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the middle.
   - ""bluf"" appears where ""blue"" is repeated.

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the second position.

3. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" in the second position.

4. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - This example is the same as the second example and supports the previous observation.

5. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
   Output: blue red blue green green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" in the fifth position, preceded by ""dax.""

From these examples, ""bluf"" appears to correspond to the color of the adjacent word that comes before it in the sequence. In:

- Example 1, that's ""lug -> blue.""
- Example 2 and 4, that's ""zup -> yellow.""
- Example 3, that's ""dax -> green.""
- Example 5, that's ""dax -> green.""

So the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it represents a repetition of the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word immediately preceding it.
walm -> repeat the prior color

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" appears in the input, the color that is outputted is the same as the color that precedes ""walm"". If ""walm"" is the first word, then the output is the color associated with ""walm"", which cannot be determined definitively from the provided context.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax zup
    ",Output: red yellow green yellow,red yellow green yellow,True,9
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" across all given examples.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's look for patterns in the input that correlate with the word appearing in the output.

- In every instance where ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- Regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence, the corresponding output is always ""green.""
- No other input word consistently results in a ""green"" output.

Hence, we can induce that the presence of the word ""dax"" in the input directly corresponds to the ""green"" in the output, independent of its position or neighboring words.

Rule: dax -> ""green""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, we need to deduce the meaning of the word ""zup."" Here is an analysis of each example:

1. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

2. Input: dax zup bluf (repeated)
   Output: green yellow yellow

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

4. Input: dax bluf wif zup
   Output: green green red yellow

5. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow

When comparing the input to the output, we can see a pattern:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" in the third input but ""yellow"" in the first two. This implies that ""bluf"" might have a context-dependent meaning or that there is some other rule at play.
- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red red.""

Now for ""zup"":

- Every time ""zup"" appears, a ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- When ""zup"" appears as the second word in the input, the output is ""yellow"" followed by the color(s) corresponding to the following word(s).
- When ""zup"" appears as the first word in the input, the first output color is ""yellow,"" and the rest of the output follows the pattern of colors corresponding to each subsequent word.
- When ""zup"" appears at the end, we see a ""yellow"" at the end of the output.

Given this data, we can infer that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" If we look into context-dependent rules, there is no additional contextual information that changes the meaning of ""zup"" within the examples provided. Therefore, it's safe to deduce the following:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"". 

This means the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the given context.
bluf -> repeated color of the preceding word. Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a color-associated word, the output is the color associated with the word prior to ""bluf"" repeated the same number of times as the letters in ""bluf"". 

In each instance, ""bluf"" follows a word that can be associated with a color (""wif"" for red, ""lug"" for blue, ""zup"" for yellow). The word ""bluf"" causes this color to be repeated four times (since ""bluf"" has four letters), as evidenced by the examples given.
From the provided examples, we can observe that the output always consists of a repetition of a color word, and the number of repetitions corresponds to the word that precedes ""walm"". Each of the words appears to have a corresponding color:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

When ""walm"" is used after any of these three words, the output color word is repeated three times. Additionally, when ""wif"" is used after ""walm"", a single ""red"" is added to the output, which seems to add a different color rather than a repetition of one.

Given this information, ""walm"" appears to act as an instruction to repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

Rule: walm indicates that the color associated with the previous word should be said three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,10
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green consistently in each example provided.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" always corresponds to the output ""red"". There is a consistent one-to-one relationship between the input ""wif"" and the output color ""red"", regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence or the presence of other nonce words. 

Given this, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. 

Here's the breakdown of each example to support this conclusion:

- Input: zup bluf
  Output: yellow yellow
  (The color associated with ""zup"" is yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats this color.)

- Input: wif dax bluf
  Output: red green green
  (The color for ""dax"" is green, and ""bluf"" repeats this color.)

- Input: wif bluf
  Output: red red
  (The color for ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" repeats this color.)

- Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
  Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
  (""Lug"" is associated with blue, which ""bluf"" repeats; ""zup"" is associated with yellow, which the next ""bluf"" repeats.)

- Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
  Output: green red green yellow yellow
  (""Zup"" is associated with yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats this color.)

Based on this analysis, the rule appears to be:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""bluf"".

Rule: Bluf repeats the color associated with the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be related to the word preceding it. Here's an analysis:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green"" repeated three times.

It's also noticeable that each instance of ""walm"" results in a repetition of a color word three times, which corresponds with the color indicated by the word immediately before ""walm.""

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color word preceding it to be repeated three times.

Therefore:
walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Each instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.

- lug dax -> blue green
- wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
- zup lug zup dax -> yellow blue yellow green
- lug bluf -> blue blue
- lug wif dax -> blue red green
Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" There are no instances where ""wif"" translates into a color other than ""red,"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence. Hence, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. Meaning: yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" results in the output repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here's how this pattern emerges from the examples:

1. wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow
   ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the color ""yellow"" is repeated.

2. zup bluf lug -> yellow yellow blue
   ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and again, ""yellow"" is repeated.

3. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
   ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the color ""red"" is repeated.

4. dax bluf -> green green
   ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the color ""green"" is repeated.

5. wif bluf -> red red
   ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the color ""red"" is repeated.

From these examples, we can induce the following rule:

bluf -> meaning: Repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it. 
Rule: If ""bluf"" follows a word that translates to a color, output that color twice.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" outputs a color repeated three times. The specific color generated by ""walm"" appears to correspond to the color that precedes it. Here's the breakdown of the pattern:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which outputs ""yellow."" Therefore ""walm"" causes ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows the second ""zup,"" which outputs ""yellow."" Consequently, ""walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which outputs ""blue."" Consequently, ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which outputs ""green."" Consequently, ""walm"" results in ""green green green.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" directly follows ""dax,"" which outputs ""green,"" so ""walm"" translates to ""green green green.""

Walm -> meaning: Walm outputs the color that precedes it, repeated three times.

Rule: If a color word precedes ""walm,"" the output of ""walm"" will be that color repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the given examples.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the provided examples, every time the nonce word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. There is no variation in this pattern, so the rule seems to be that the word ""wif"" translates directly to the color ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" regardless of the words that follow it. Thus, the rule is:

zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that the word preceding it represents. Here is the pattern:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output. ""Bluf"" also follows ""dax,"" and the word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and ""dax"" is ""green"" in the output.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and the output for ""lug"" is ""blue.""
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and ""zup"" respectively, and the output is ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color of the preceding word.
walm -> repeats the color of the previous word. Rule: When ""walm"" is used after a word, it takes on the color value of the preceding word. If the preceding word does not have an associated color (as in the case of ""walm"" following another ""walm""), it repeats the last color mentioned.

Examples:
- In ""zup walm lug,"" ""zup"" is yellow, so ""walm"" also becomes yellow.
- In ""walm wif walm,"" the first ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which is red, so the first ""walm"" is red, and the second ""walm"" repeats that red color.
- In ""wif dax lug walm,"" the word ""lug"" is blue, and thus the following ""walm"" is also blue.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in every instance it is used.
dax -> green. Rule: Each unique word following ""dax"" is associated with a unique color. ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""lug"" to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""bluf"" has no direct color association stated, but since it follows the pattern of unique words getting a color, we can infer it might be red as well given that ""wif"" repeated twice in the third example and retained the same color each time. However, without further context, we cannot conclude with certainty the color representation of ""bluf"".
Rule: wif -> red

This rule is concluded based on the consistent appearance of ""red"" after ""wif"" in each example provided.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow"". Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context provided by adjacent words, the presence of ""zup"" results in the word ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, the rule I can deduce is:

zup -> meaning. Meaning: ""zup"" means ""yellow"".

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the output should include the word ""yellow"" corresponding to its position.
Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that immediately precedes it. If there is no preceding word, bluf is not defined.
- In Example 1, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"" because 'dax' is associated with the color green, and 'bluf' takes on the color of the preceding word.
- In Example 2, ""lug bluf wif"" translates to ""blue blue red"" because 'lug' is associated with blue, 'bluf' again takes on the color of the preceding word, which is blue, and 'wif' is associated with red.
- In Example 3, ""wif lug bluf"" translates to ""red blue blue"" for similar reasons; 'bluf' takes the color of 'lug', which is blue.
- In Example 4, ""wif bluf zup"" translates to ""red red yellow"" with 'bluf' taking the color red from 'wif'.
- In Example 5, ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"", with 'bluf' first matching 'zup' as yellow, then 'lug' as blue, and finally 'bluf' matches 'zup' as yellow again. 'Walm' is not defined but follows the pattern of repeating the color of 'zup', which is yellow.
Rule: walm -> green.

In each input, when the word ""walm"" appears, the corresponding output is ""green."" Therefore, the rule deduced is that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to the color ""green.""

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given context.
Based on the examples provided, each unique word corresponds to a specific color. The nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in every occurrence. Here's the decoding for each word based on the examples:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> green
- walm -> yellow (assuming this from context, as it appears once and the output is yellow)

The rule appears to be that each nonce word is assigned a specific color. The output colors follow the sequence of nonce words exactly as they appear in the input.

Rule: A nonce word corresponds to a specific color in a one-to-one relationship, and ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""
Rule: wif -> red

Each instance of the word ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red"" in the output. Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words, ""wif"" consistently results in ""red"" being in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in every provided output, regardless of the other words present in the input.
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to induce the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"":

When examining the input-output pairs, the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" There is no clear pattern that connects the placement of the word ""bluf"" to a change in the output color. The colors associated with other words in the input, such as ""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup,"" change depending on their position or repetition, but the color for ""bluf"" remains green, regardless of context. 

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

bluf -> green

Rule: The word ""bluf"" always corresponds to the color green.
Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning is to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it, turning it red if the word before walm is ""wif"", or maintaining the original color otherwise.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided input-output pairs, we can identify the following patterns:

- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""walm"" consistently translates to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""blue.""

Now, taking into account the word ""lug"":

- In both ""lug wif"" and ""lug zup,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and the second word retains its individual color (""red"" for ""wif"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup"").
- In ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" ""lug"" is followed by a ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" and here ""lug"" precedes it as ""blue.""
- In the final example, ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif,"" ""lug"" is between ""zup"" (yellow) and ""bluf"" (blue), and in this case, ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> ""blue""
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at each example and the corresponding output:

1. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug → red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
2. wif zup wif dax → red yellow red green
3. zup dax bluf → yellow green green
4. zup bluf lug dax lug → yellow yellow blue green blue
5. wif dax → red green

From the examples given, we can see that each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green."" In all cases, regardless of the position of “dax” in the input sequence, the color green is consistently outputted when “dax” is present in the input. This suggests that ""dax"" itself translates directly to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in each given example.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" 

Thus, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" changes its meaning depending on the context, specifically, according to the word that precedes it. To determine the rule, let's analyze the input-output pairs:

1. ""zup wif bluf zup"" -> ""yellow red red yellow""
2. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
3. ""lug bluf dax bluf"" -> ""blue blue green green""
4. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue red blue green green""
5. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue""

Looking at the outputs corresponding to ""bluf"", it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that comes before it:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the third example, there are two instances of ""bluf"". The first ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", corresponding to ""blue"", and the second ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", corresponding to ""green"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" once again, leading to ""green"" as the output.
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", resulting in ""yellow"" in the output.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" is a placeholder for a color word, and it adopts the color of the word that precedes it. If there is no word before ""bluf,"" then by default, it takes the color associated with ""zup"" which is ""yellow"" as seen in the second example.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" does not have a fixed meaning, but rather its meaning changes depending on the context within the input sequence. To deduce the rule that defines the meaning of ""walm,"" we must look at the relationship between the input and the output in each example.

Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

- ""dax"" outputs ""green""
- ""zup"" outputs ""yellow""
- ""wif"" outputs ""red""
- ""walm"" in this case replicates the color of the word before it, which is ""zup,"" so it outputs ""yellow.""

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

- ""zup"" outputs ""yellow""
- ""wif"" outputs ""red""
- ""lug"" outputs ""blue""
- Here ""walm"" again replicates the color of the word before it, ""wif,"" so it outputs ""red.""

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

- ""wif"" outputs ""red""
- ""bluf"" outputs ""green""
- ""dax"" outputs ""green""
- ""lug"" outputs ""blue""
- In this longer sequence, each instance of ""walm"" continues to output the color of the previous word (""wif""), so it outputs ""red.""

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

- ""wif"" outputs ""red""
- ""zup"" outputs ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow""
- ""lug"" outputs ""blue""
- Here, ""walm"" again takes on the color of the previous word (""lug""), resulting in ""blue.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

- ""dax"" outputs ""green""
- The only instance of ""walm"" here follows ""dax"" and outputs ""green,"" matching ""dax.""

Based on these observations, the rule for the meaning of ""walm"" seems to be that it replicates the output color of the word that precedes it in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> takes on the color output of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sentence.
Based on the given examples, it appears that each instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Other words seem to be associated consistently with other colors, for example, ""wif"" with ""red,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green"" in the output.
Rule: wif -> red

Each occurrence of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, each instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. The context in which ""zup"" is used does not alter its meaning, indicating that ""zup"" consistently maps to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Analyzing the given examples, we can attempt to identify a pattern for the word ""bluf"" by looking at the corresponding output colors:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green
2. Input: zup lug bluf -> Output: yellow blue blue
3. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
4. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf -> Output: blue red blue green green
5. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup -> Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow

Let's look at each instance where ""bluf"" appears and its output:

- ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red""
- ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue""
- ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow""
- ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green""

Given this pattern, it appears that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it. In other words:

""bluf"" -> meaning. The meaning is that ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the preceding word. Rule: If a word's color is X, then ""word bluf"" translates to ""X X"".
walm -> repeats the color of the previous word in the sequence three times.

Rule: If the previous word translates to a color, walm replicates that color three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
dax -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, dax consistently results in the output color green, regardless of the position in the sequence or the accompanying words (wif, bluf, zup, lug, walm). Therefore, ""dax"" appears to correlate specifically to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Observing the examples and the corresponding outputs, we can infer a pattern associated with the occurrences of the nonce word ""zup"" and other words:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""bluf"" seems to result in multiple ""red"" but when paired with ""dax,"" it gives ""green.""
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue.""

From this, we can discern that ""zup"" always results in ""yellow"" and does not modify the output of the words that follow it in the sequence; rather, each word is translated independently to its assigned color.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> ""yellow""
bluf -> meaning. The meaning seems to be repeating the color associated with the word directly preceding it.

Rule: Whenever the word ""bluf"" is mentioned in the input, it triggers the duplication of the color corresponding to the word just before it. For example, ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, so ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue."" Similarly, ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green."" This rule is consistent across all the provided inputs and outputs.
Observing the examples given, it appears that the word ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it three times. Here are the details that lead to this conclusion:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" ""red"" is repeated three times since ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
2. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times since ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
3. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" ""green"" is repeated three times since ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is: walm -> triggers the repetition of the previously mentioned color three times.

Rule: When walm follows a word representing a color, it causes the representation of that color to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Each instance of ""lug"" in the input is translated to ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red."" Thus, every time ""wif"" appears in an input, ""red"" is included in the corresponding output. It seems that other words may have their own corresponding color output as well. Specifically, ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" appears to correspond to ""red"" when it precedes ""zup,"" but this pattern is not definitively clear from the examples alone as it occurs red only when following or preceding ""wif.""

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow. 

The constant output for the word ""zup"" in different contexts is ""yellow,"" indicating that the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following pattern of correspondence between the input and output:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- bluf -> duplicates the color immediately preceding it
- zup -> yellow

Looking through each example, whenever ""bluf"" follows another word, it repeats the color that was translated from the word before it. ""Bluf"" does not represent a color by itself; instead, it refers to a repetition of the last color mentioned.

For instance:
- In the first input, ""lug wif lug bluf"", ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and the second ""lug"" again to ""blue"". ""Bluf"" follows the second ""lug"" so it results in another ""blue"".
- In the fourth input, ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"", the second ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow"", hence we get another ""yellow"" for that ""bluf"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color immediately preceding it.
walm -> repetition of the color associated with the previous word. Rule: Repeat the color corresponding to the word that comes before ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. The meaning of ""lug"" based on the given examples is consistently represented as ""blue."" 

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, each instance where the nonce word ""wif"" is used corresponds to the output ""red."" It seems that ""wif"" is being used consistently to represent the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" influences the color output, and it seems to yield the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Let's verify this with the given examples:

- ""zup wif"" yields ""yellow red,"" with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""red"" (though it's probably meant to be ""blue"" due to the later examples, suggesting a possible error in this output), ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" yields ""yellow.""
- In the third example, it further establishes that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" also corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" ""zup"" again gives ""yellow.""
- ""zup walm"" yields a sequence of three ""yellow,"" signifying that both ""zup"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""yellow.""
- Lastly, ""zup lug walm"" provides a sequence of ""yellow blue blue blue,"" again, with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow.""

Hence, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" regardless of context.
Rule: bluf -> copy the color of the previous word. If there is no previous word, bluf defaults to yellow.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will analyze the correspondence between its position in the input and the color in the output:

1. dax wif walm lug zup
    - green red red red blue yellow

2. lug wif dax zup walm
    - blue red green yellow yellow yellow

3. dax walm lug
    - green green green blue

4. zup wif walm lug
    - yellow red red red blue

5. wif bluf dax walm
    - red red green green green

Looking at the examples, the color that follows ""walm"" in the input corresponds with the color red in the output. However, we notice that the color before ""walm"" is repeated twice in the output, once before red and once after (e.g., in example 3, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and in the output, we see ""green red green;"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, resulting in ""green green green blue"").

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the next color to be red and the preceding color to repeat once before red and once after red.

Rule: walm -> causes the next color in the sequence to be red, and repeats the previous color in the output once before and once after red.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue within the given examples.
Rule: dax -> green.

Each instance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of the preceding or following words.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided. Here's how ""wif"" is used in each example:

1. Input: wif | Output: red
2. Input: lug zup wif zup | Output: blue yellow red yellow
3. Input: wif dax | Output: red green
4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm | Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
5. Input: zup wif walm | Output: yellow red red red

From the examples, we can see that whenever ""wif"" is used, it is followed by the color ""red"" in the output. This pattern holds regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples given, it appears that the word ""zup"" is associated with a specific color output each time it is encountered. Each example follows a pattern where the input words (wif, dax, bluf, lug) are associated with specific color outputs (red, green, red, blue, respectively), and ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""bluf"" by correlating its presence with the outputs.

Let's look at each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
   Output: red yellow yellow red green
   
2. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   
3. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   
4. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   
5. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

From the examples provided, ""bluf"" is always followed by an output of the color ""yellow."" It doesn't matter what comes before ""bluf""; the output for ""bluf"" itself is consistently ""yellow,"" which suggests that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> meaning: yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output color to be repeated three times and to match the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" To demonstrate the rule more clearly:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output immediately following ""walm"" is three ""green,"" which is the color associated with ""dax.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is three consecutive ""yellow,"" which is the color linked with ""zup.""
- In the third and fourth examples, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and ""lug"" respectively, and the output is three consecutive ""red"" and ""blue,"" matching the colors of ""wif"" and ""lug.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" again follows ""zup,"" and the output is three ""yellow,"" consistently corresponding with the color of ""zup.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" is used after another word, the output color is three instances of the color associated with the preceding word.

Walm -> The output color is repeated three times, matching the color associated with the word that comes directly before ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in each example.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" correlates to a specific output color, ""green."" Each time the input contains ""dax,"" the output includes ""green."" Additionally, the position of ""dax"" in the input does not seem to impact its corresponding output; ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its placement. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of the other words present or their order. Each of the other words (zup, walm, dax, lug, bluf) corresponds to its unique color. Here is what we can deduce from the given examples:

- Every occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- Each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- Each instance of ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- Each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- Each instance of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- Each instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: In every example, the occurrence of the nonce word 'zup' corresponds with the color 'yellow' in the output. Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present, 'zup' consistently translates to 'yellow'.
Rule: bluf -> the color word that precedes 'bluf' is repeated. 

For example, if the color word 'wif' (which translates to red) comes before 'bluf', the output will be 'red red'. Thus in the context of these instructions, bluf triggers a repetition of the preceding color word in the output.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to examine how the outputs relate to the inputs. Let’s analyze each example.

1. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

Let's analyze the pattern in which ""walm"" is used.

In the first example, we see ""walm lug"" at the end, and the corresponding output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" Since ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue,"" we can assume that ""walm"" is responsible for the triple ""yellow.""

In the second example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and since ""zup"" on its own translates to ""yellow,"" we can assume ""walm"" repeats the prior color three times.

In the third example, ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green,"" which again shows that ""walm"" is followed by three repetitions of the color associated with ""wif"" before ""dax"" changes the pattern.

In the fourth example, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue,"" where ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and we again see the color blue repeated three times.

The fifth example also supports this rule, as ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and there are three repetitions of ""blue"" before the sequence changes with ""zup lug.""

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

- When ""dax"" appears after ""lug"", the output is ""green"" immediately after ""blue"".
- When ""dax"" is provided on its own, the output is ""green"".
- When ""dax"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""lug"", the output is ""green"" before ""blue"".
- The context does not change the output associated with ""dax"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be that irrespective of the context or position in the sequence, ""dax"" consistently maps to the output ""green"".

dax -> meaning. Rule: ""dax"" means ""green"".
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in each example provided.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the common elements in each input-output pair where ""bluf"" is present.

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

Here, ""bluf"" is associated with the second instance of the color red.

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

Again, here ""bluf"" is associated with the second instance of the color red.

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Once more, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second red.

Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

In this sequence, each instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to a red color following a green or a yellow.

Input: dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow

And once again, ""bluf"" is followed by the color red.

Considering the pattern in each case, ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color red. The condition seems to be that ""bluf"" equates to red when following another color, without any condition specific to the position or the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can infer that the word ""walm"" translates to ""red red red"". Each time ""walm"" appears in an input, the output consistently shows three ""red"" in a row. 

Therefore, the rule can be described as:

Walm -> meaning: ""red red red"". The presence of ""walm"" within an input sequence always results in the consecutive output of the color ""red"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples and their corresponding outputs, it seems that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: In every example provided, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
Based on the examples provided and looking for patterns, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" This is demonstrated by the consistency of the output when ""wif"" is used in various positions within the input series, always resulting in ""red"" regardless of its position or the other words around it. 

Therefore, the rule for the word ""wif"" is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" seems consistent:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to the color that precedes it. Here's the breakdown based on your examples:

- In the first example (""lug dax bluf wif dax""), the color before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color green. After ""bluf"", the color green repeats.
- In the second example (""wif bluf zup wif lug dax""), ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" which has the corresponding color red. After ""bluf"", the color red repeats.
- In the third example (""wif bluf zup""), the pattern persists where ""wif"" (red) is before ""bluf"" and red is repeated after ""bluf.""
- In the fourth example (""zup bluf""), ""zup"" (yellow) precedes ""bluf"" and is repeated after ""bluf.""
- In the fifth example (""dax bluf wif zup""), ""dax"" (green) precedes ""bluf"" and green is repeated after ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the color word immediately preceding it.
walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" appears to be repetition of the color associated with the preceding word for a number of times equal to the number of words that follow ""walm"" in the sequence. 

Rule: ""walm"" induces a repetition of the color corresponding to the word before it, with the amount of repetitions being equal to the count of words that come after it in the list.

Based on the provided examples, the word 'dax' consistently corresponds to the color 'green'. Each time the word 'dax' is presented in the input, the output includes the color 'green'.

So, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we need to analyze the occurrences of ""wif"" in the examples and their corresponding outputs.

In the examples, we notice:

- When ""wif"" is present, the color ""red"" always appears in the output.
- ""wif"" does not have a fixed position in the input sequence, yet ""red"" consistently appears.
- The number of times ""red"" appears is not directly tied to the position of ""wif"" within the input.
- The other words in the input (""bluf,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""lug"") result in different colors in the output (""red,"" ""green,"" ""yellow,"" ""blue"").
- No other word in the inputs consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output; ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" in some cases but not always.

From this information, we can deduce that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. The rule is consistent across all examples, regardless of ""wif"" position or other words present.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it. Rule: If a word is followed by ""bluf,"" the color corresponding to the preceding word is repeated in the output for ""bluf.""
By examining the input and output pairs provided, it becomes clear that the presence of ""walm"" in the input corresponds to the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word in the input three times in the output.

1. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" - ""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times.
2. ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow"" - Here, ""wif"" is associated with red, ""walm"" causes red to repeat three times, ""dax"" is associated with green and ""zup"" with yellow.
3. ""zup lug walm"" outputs ""yellow blue blue blue"" - ""zup"" is yellow, ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" causes blue to repeat three times.
4. ""dax walm zup walm"" outputs ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"" - Here ""dax"" is green, ""walm"" causes green to repeat three times, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""walm"" causes yellow to repeat three times.
5. ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red"" - ""dax"" is associated with green, ""walm"" causes green to repeat three times, followed by ""wif"" which is red.

Based on these observations, we can induce the rule that ""walm"" after a word causes the color associated with that word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""dax"" translates to a specific color in the output. Here's the pattern observed:

- When ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" always appears in the corresponding output.
- The position of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the position of ""green"" in the output.
- Other words in the input correspond to other specific colors (e.g., ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"").

From these observations, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" is associated with the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the term ""wif"" is consistently translated to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. The meaning of ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the output contains the color yellow at the corresponding position.
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule governing the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" through comparison.

In the first example:
Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
The word ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the corresponding output is ""red red"". Here, the appearance of ""bluf"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the previous word.

In the second example:
Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green
""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the corresponding output is ""green green"". Again, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it.

In the third example:
Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax
Output: green green yellow yellow green
Each occurrence of ""bluf"" is followed by a color that repeats the color linked to the word before it.

In the fourth example, the input-output pattern is identical to the second example and doesn't provide any new information about the rule.

The fifth example:
Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
Output: yellow yellow red blue green
Here, the pattern holds as ""bluf"" after ""zup"" becomes ""yellow yellow"", once again repeating the color associated with the preceding word (zup -> yellow). 

Bluf -> meaning. Rule:
The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word in the sequence. If the previous word outputs ""red"", ""bluf"" will result in another ""red"". If the previous word outputs ""yellow"", ""bluf"" will produce another ""yellow"", and so on.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" generates a repetition of the color word that precedes it. The number of repetitions is three times. Let's look at the examples:

- Input: lug walm wif lug bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
  Given that ""lug"" signals ""blue,"" when followed by ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times; ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" has no impact on the rule for ""walm.""

- Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue
  ""Dax"" stands for ""green,"" and ""lug"" for ""blue."" When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.

- Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
  ""Zup"" represents ""yellow,"" and followed by ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

- Input: lug zup dax walm -> Output: blue yellow green green green
  ""Lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax"" represent ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""green,"" respectively. ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and therefore ""green"" is repeated three times.

- Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red
  ""Dax"" stands for ""green,"" so followed by ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times; ""wif"" stands for ""red"" and is not related to the rule for ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
dax -> green

Rule: Each unique word translates to a unique color. ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence. ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" to ""red,"" ""wif"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" These mappings remain consistent across different examples.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that words are being translated into colors. Notably, ""wif"" appears to correspond to the color red.

Here is the evidence leading to this conclusion:

- In the first input, ""wif"" is the third word and corresponds to the third color in the output, which is red.
- In the second input, ""wif"" is the second word and corresponds to the second color in the output, which is red.
- In the third input, ""wif"" is the sixth word and corresponds to the sixth color in the output, which is red.
- In the fourth input, ""wif"" is the first and the only word (repeated twice), and the output is ""red red,"" indicating that both instances of ""wif"" translate to red.
- In the fifth input, ""wif"" is the first word, and the output starts with red, further supporting that ""wif"" corresponds to red.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> meaning: yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to cause the previous word's translation to repeat. Here's how it works with each example:

- wif bluf -> red red
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
- lug wif bluf -> blue red red
- dax bluf lug wif -> green green blue red

In each case, the color word that comes directly before ""bluf"" is repeated in the output. Thus, ""bluf"" seems to be an instruction to duplicate the color word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the translation of the previous word.
walm -> meaning.

To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the input and output to understand the relationship. Let's analyze the commonalities when ""walm"" appears.

1. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
2. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
3. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
4. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
5. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green

Looking at the examples:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears, it causes the following word to repeat the color of the previous word. For example, in the first input, ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and when ""walm"" follows, ""zup"" also translates into ""blue.""

- This rule is consistent across all other examples.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow,blue yellow,True,27
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> ""blue""
From the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or the rule associated with the word ""dax.""

When ""dax"" appears alone, the output is ""green"":

- Input: dax
- Output: green

This also happens when ""dax"" appears alongside other words:

- Input: wif dax zup
- Output: red green yellow
  
- Input: lug walm dax
- Output: blue blue blue green

- Input: zup wif dax walm
- Output: yellow red green green green

Notice that ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green,"" regardless of its position within the input sequence. Other words in the sequence have distinct color associations as well (e.g., ""wif"" -> ""red,"" ""zup"" -> ""yellow,"" ""lug"" and ""walm"" -> ""blue""). 

Based on this, the rule for ""dax"" is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" is a function that translates the following word into a corresponding color. Each word after ""wif"" is mapped to a specific color:

- dax -> green
- bluf -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow

Given that the output color directly follows the nonce word ""wif"" and the pattern is consistent across multiple examples, we can infer that ""wif"" acts as a translator or marker indicating that the next word will be translated into a specific color.

Rule: wif -> precedes a word that corresponds to a color, acting as the indicator for the translation from nonce word to color.
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in each instance. When ""zup"" is combined with other nonce words, each of these words is translated to a corresponding color. The pattern indicates that:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

When ""zup"" appears alone, the output is only ""yellow"", which supports the idea that ""zup"" is consistently associated with the color yellow regardless of context.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at each example in sequence while comparing inputs to outputs.

1. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug → Output: yellow red red yellow blue
    - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
    - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
    - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

2. Input: lug zup bluf dax → Output: blue yellow yellow green
    - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

3. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup → Output: green green red blue yellow
    - The sequence of ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green""

4. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax → Output: green green red yellow green
    - Similarly, the sequence of ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green""

5. Input: dax bluf → Output: green green
    - Whenever ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green""

Based on examples 3, 4, and 5, where ""dax bluf"" consistently results in ""green green,"" it suggests that ""bluf"" is acting as a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:
Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
Rule: walm -> the repeated word that directly precedes it. 

In each instance, walm takes the color of the word immediately before it and repeats it three times in the output as a color. For example: ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Similarly, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Based on the output provided for each input containing the word ""lug,"" we can deduce that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer a relationship between the input words and the output colors. Each word seems to correspond to a specific color. Examining the repetition of colors associated with each word and where ""dax"" appears, we can deduce the following:

- In the first example, ""dax"" is followed by ""zup walm wif walm,"" and the output begins with ""green,"" followed by alternate ""yellow"" and ""red."" Notice that the output contains one green, two yellows, and three reds.
- In the second example, ""dax"" appears as the second word followed by ""zup wif,"" and the output sequence is ""red green yellow red"". ""wif"" is both the first and last word, and both times it's matched with ""red"". ""dax"" is matched with ""green.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" is the only input and ""green"" is the only output.
- In the fourth example, ""lug dax"" gives ""blue green,"" and ""lug"" has not appeared before, so it is safe to assume ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and we again see ""dax"" corresponding to ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax,"" produces ""red blue blue yellow yellow green."" Previous patterns suggest that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""dax"" at the end correlates with ""green"" again.

Considering the evidence, the rule seems consistent: the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples given, every occurrence of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> duplicate the color of the word that follows it. Rule: When the word ""bluf"" is used, it takes the color associated with the following word and duplicates it.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rules for the nonce word ""walm"":

1. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
2. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
3. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
4. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Every time ""walm"" appears in an input, output colors repeat the color of the word that precedes ""walm"", based on the following observations:

- In ""dax zup dax walm"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"", so the output after ""walm"" is ""green green"".
- In ""dax walm"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"", so the two outputs after ""walm"" are ""green green"".
- In ""zup wif lug zup walm"", ""walm"" follows ""zup"", so the output after ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow"".
- In ""zup wif walm"", ""walm"" follows ""wif"", so the output after ""walm"" is ""red red red"".
- In ""dax walm zup"", ""walm"" immediately follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup"". It duplicates the ""green"" corresponding to ""dax"" (yielding ""green green"") and is then followed by ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"".

Thus, the underlying rule seems to be that the word ""walm"" causes the next part of the output to repeat the color code of the word that precedes ""walm"". The repetition occurs as many times as the word ""walm"" itself appears in succession plus one.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word as many times as ""walm"" appears in succession plus one.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Each occurrence of the word ""lug"" results in the word ""blue"" appearing in the output.

dax -> green

Rule: The word dax is consistently translated as the color green in each example provided.
wif -> red. Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' consistently translates to the color 'yellow,' regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the consistent patterns before and after the word appears as well as its corresponding color output.

1. In all instances where ""bluf"" appears, the output for ""bluf"" is always ""yellow.""
2. Looking at the various positions of ""bluf"" within the inputs doesn't seem to change its output - it remains ""yellow"" regardless of its position.
3. The positions of other words relative to ""bluf"" do not appear to affect their own outputs, suggesting ""bluf"" does not modify the outputs of adjacent words.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow"" without context dependency.

Rule: bluf -> yellow
walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a rule that dictates repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times.

Rule: If a word is followed by ""walm,"" then the output is the color corresponding to that word repeated three times. For example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green.""

    Rules:

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
Rule: dax -> green

Each occurrence of ""dax"" in the examples corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
Inspecting each pair of input and output sequences and focusing on instances of the nonce word ""zup,"" we can determine its meaning based on its consistent output:

1. zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green green green yellow red
2. zup lug zup dax -> yellow blue yellow green
3. dax zup walm wif walm -> green yellow yellow yellow red red red
4. zup -> yellow
5. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue

Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To figure out the meaning of the word ""bluf"" based on the examples provided, let's look for patterns closely in the input and output sequences:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""red"" is part of the output sequence.
2. The occurrence of ""red"" in the output is exclusively tied to the presence of ""bluf"" in the input.
3. The other words ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup"" correlate to other unique colors in the output: ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".
4. When ""bluf"" is present without ""wif"" preceding it, the color outputted is simply ""green"", the same output as for ""dax"".
5. When both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" are both present, the output is ""red red"" suggesting that ""bluf"" somehow interacts with ""wif"" to produce a double ""red"".

Considering these patterns, it appears that ""bluf"" may translate to or represent the color ""green"". However, when it is preceded by ""wif"", it produces an additional ""red"", leading to ""red red"". Since ""wif"" already translates to ""red"", ""bluf"" might have a different behavior when following ""wif"".

Rule: 
bluf -> ""green"" when alone or not proceeded by ""wif"", however, when it follows ""wif"", it triggers an additional ""red"", thus giving a sequence of ""red red"".
Rule: ""walm"" stands for repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three more times.

    Rules:

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of context.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's break down each example and look for patterns.

1. dax walm wif zup -> green green green red yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""walm"" also corresponds to ""green"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - The presence of ""wif"" results in a ""red"" following the sequence of ""green"".

2. dax wif -> green red
   - After ""dax"" which is ""green"", ""wif"" again results in a ""red"".

3. dax lug dax wif dax -> green blue green red green
   - ""dax"" is consistently ""green"" and ""lug"" maps to ""blue"".
   - ""wif"" follows two ""green"" and one ""blue"" resulting in ""red"".

4. lug walm dax wif lug wif -> blue blue blue green red blue red
   - ""lug"" and ""walm"" both map to ""blue"", and ""dax"" is ""green"".
   - ""wif"" follows this sequence of colors with a ""red"", and it does so twice (after both a ""green"" and a ""blue"").

5. zup wif bluf zup -> yellow red red yellow
   - ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" is not provided in the output, but we can infer that it could map to ""red"" because it precedes a ""red"".
   - ""wif"" is between ""yellow"" and ""red"".

Considering the patterns observed, ""wif"" seems to trigger a ""red"" in the output, regardless of the word that comes before it. More specifically, it appears to cause the color that corresponds to the previous word to change to ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> changes the output color to red, irrespective of the preceding word.

Hence, the meaning assigned is:
wif -> changes the next color in the sequence to red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each provided example, regardless of additional context. When ""wif"" is present, the output includes ""red"" alongside ""yellow"", and when ""lug"" is added, ""blue"" is also included. However, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Each instance of ""bluf"" in the inputs correlates directly with ""red"" in the outputs. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

bluf -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" means ""red.""
walm -> meaning: The word ""walm"" causes the color prior to it to be repeated three times.

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" is present in the input, the output repeats the corresponding color of the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times.

    Rules:

Based on the provided examples, dax corresponds to the color green. In each instance, the word ""dax"" always results in the output of the word ""green."" 

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" aligns with the output ""red"" regardless of its position in the input or the other words present. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the rule, let's analyze the occurrences of 'zup' and the corresponding outputs step by step.

1. Input: wif dax zup
   Output: red green yellow
2. Input: lug dax zup dax wif
   Output: blue green yellow green red
3. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
4. Input: zup
   Output: yellow
5. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

In each case where 'zup' appears, the word 'yellow' immediately follows it in the output, including when 'zup' is the only input word. The presence of 'zup' does not seem to affect the output of the succeeding words, as their outputs are consistent regardless of whether 'zup' precedes them.

Based on these examples, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Reviewing the examples provided and their corresponding outputs, it appears that the word 'bluf' relates to the word 'blue,' but it is not always directly translated to 'blue' in the output. 

In the first example, 'lug bluf dax bluf' translates to 'blue blue green green,' indicating that 'bluf' means 'blue' when following 'lug,' but 'green' when following 'dax.'

In the second example, 'zup bluf dax' translates to 'yellow yellow green,' suggesting that 'bluf' means 'yellow' when following 'zup,' but 'green' when followed by 'dax.'

The third example, 'lug wif lug bluf,' translates to 'blue red blue blue,' which means that 'bluf' means 'blue' when it is preceded by 'lug.'

The fourth example, 'zup dax bluf,' translates to 'yellow green green,' reinforcing the idea from the second example that 'bluf' means 'green' when it comes after 'dax.'

Last example, 'zup bluf wif dax lug' translates to 'yellow yellow red green blue,' which indicates that 'bluf' is 'yellow' after 'zup,' 'red' after 'wif,' 'green' after 'dax,' and 'blue' after 'lug.'

From these examples, it can be deduced that the meaning of 'bluf' is dependent on the word immediately preceding it. The rule appears to be as follows:

- After 'lug,' 'bluf' means 'blue.'
- After 'zup,' 'bluf' means 'yellow.'
- After 'dax,' 'bluf' means 'green.'
- After 'wif,' 'bluf' appears to mean 'red.'

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> meaning changes based on the preceding word: after 'lug' it means 'blue,' after 'zup' it means 'yellow,' after 'dax' it means 'green,' and after 'wif' it means 'red'.
Rule: walm means a repetition of the color word preceding it three times.

walm -> meaning: repeat the color word before ""walm"" three times.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Whenever we see the term ""dax"" in the input, it translates to ""green"" in the output. Regardless of its position in a sequence or the presence of other words, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"".
Based on the given examples, ""wif"" seems to indicate the word ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Here's the breakdown of how ""wif"" correlates with the output:

- ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"" (wif correlates with the second word, which is red)
- ""dax wif"" -> ""green red"" (wif correlates with the second word, which is red)
- ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red"" (wif correlates with the second word, which is red)
- ""wif lug zup"" -> ""red blue yellow"" (wif correlates with the first word, which is red)
- ""wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow"" (wif correlates with the first word, which is red)

Based on these correlations, it can be deduced that:

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the repeating color of the word that comes before it. Here is the analysis:

- In ""zup bluf dax"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In ""wif bluf"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red.""
- In ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the following ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" as well.
- In ""lug bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it takes the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word
Observing the provided examples and the corresponding outputs, we can attempt to induce the rule that governs the nonce word ""walm.""

In the given outputs, the appearance of ""walm"" correlates with a repetition of the color that immediately precedes its first mention. The number of repetitions seems to be governed by a count starting from one, determined by the order in which the colors are introduced. To clarify:

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" must mean ""yellow,"" and since ""walm"" is the second word, it corresponds to ""yellow"" being repeated two additional times (for a total of three mentions of ""yellow"").
  
- In ""wif lug walm,"" ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" Since ""walm"" is the third word, it corresponds to ""blue"" being repeated three times (including the original mention, thus four times in total).
  
- For ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" we have ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" ""red"" for ""wif,"" and ""green"" for ""dax."" ""Walm"" appears as the fourth word, so ""green"" is repeated four times. ""Lug"" is a new word that translates to ""blue.""

- ""zup wif walm"" leads to ""yellow red red red."" Here, ""walm"" as the third word means ""red"" is repeated twice more (three times total).

- In ""dax walm wif,"" ""dax"" means ""green,"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" ""Walm"" appears as the second word, so ""green"" is said three times in total.

According to these observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be described as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word. The quantity of repetition equals one less than the position of the first occurrence of ""walm"" in the input. For example, if ""walm"" is the second word in the sequence, the color is repeated two times in total.

Thus, the rule is:
Walm -> Repeat the preceding color word in the output, the number of times equal to its order of appearance in the input sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:

Based on the examples provided, each time the word ""dax"" appears, the output is consistently ""green."" Thus, the rule seems to be that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" is present in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: Bluf -> The color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" If ""bluf"" is the first word, then ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of ""dax"" (green).

- In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and outputs red; therefore, ""bluf"" in this context means red.
- In the second example, ""wif"" is again before ""bluf"" and it outputs red, supporting the initial observation.
- In the third example, ""zup"" is before ""bluf"" which outputs yellow, indicating ""bluf"" here means yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" and ""bluf"" together output yellow yellow, and after ""bluf"" comes ""wif"" which outputs red, consistent with prior examples.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and outputs green; thus, ""bluf"" in this context means green.

Based on these observations:

bluf -> The color that matches the word that is immediately before ""bluf."" If ""bluf"" is at the start of the sequence, default to green, the color associated with ""dax.""
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to be a modifier that causes the following word to be repeated a certain number of times equal to the number of times the color associated with the word preceding ""walm"" is represented in the output. Here is the pattern based on each input and its output:

- In the first example, ""lug wif zup wif walm"" leads to ""blue red yellow red red red"". Since ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which is associated with ""red"", ""red"" is repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" generates ""red red red"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"", and ""red"" is repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"". In this case, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which is correlated with ""blue"", and ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""zup lug walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue"". ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" associated with ""blue"", thus ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm zup"" produces ""green green green yellow"". ""Walm"" follows ""dax"", which is connected to ""green"", and ""green"" is repeated three times before continuing with the color associated with ""zup"", which is ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is used after another nonce word, the color corresponding to that nonce word is repeated three times in the output before continuing with the normal sequence of colors associated with any following nonce words.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,35
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"". Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. This correlation remains constant across all examples regardless of the surrounding words.

Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
Analyzing the given examples, it seems that each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output. Every instance of ""zup"" in the input doesn't appear to depend on any surrounding context but directly translates to the same word in the output. Thus, we can deduce:

zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be that it replicates the output of the word immediately preceding it. When ""bluf"" follows another word, it produces an output consisting of two repetitions of the color associated with the preceding word. 

Rule: ""bluf"" -> repeat the color associated with the previous word twice.
To determine the meaning or rule for 'walm,' let's analyze the examples.

Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow
- 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
- 'dax' corresponds to 'green'
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'
- 'walm' here is corresponding to 'green'

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow
- 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'
- Considering previous information, 'walm' here seems to correspond to 'blue'

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
- 'dax' corresponds to 'green'
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'
- 'walm' here is corresponding to 'yellow'

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
- 'lug' corresponds to 'blue' (consistent with previous)
- 'dax' corresponds to 'green'
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
- 'walm' here corresponds to 'blue', which is the same as the previous word, 'lug'

Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output: green green green red blue green green green
- 'dax' corresponds to 'green'
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
- 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'
- 'walm' corresponds to 'green', which is the same as the previous word, 'dax'

From the information gathered, 'walm' appears to repeat the color of the word directly preceding it.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,36
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" 

Every time ""lug"" is present in the input, ""blue"" appears the same number of times in the corresponding output. There is no variation in the color that ""lug"" maps to, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Therefore, we can deduce that the meaning of ""lug"" is not dependent on context within these examples.

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" is translated as the color ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red, regardless of its position or the context in which it is used.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
From the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" by looking at the pattern of input and output pairs:

1. dax bluf wif zup dax -> green green red yellow green
2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
3. lug bluf dax bluf -> blue blue green green
4. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
5. wif zup bluf lug -> red yellow yellow blue

If we observe each pair, ""bluf"" seems to replicate the color of the word that comes immediately before it:

1. dax (green) bluf (green) wif (red) zup (yellow) dax (green)
2. zup (yellow) bluf (yellow)
3. lug (blue) bluf (blue) dax (green) bluf (green)
4. zup (yellow) bluf (yellow)
5. wif (red) zup (yellow) bluf (yellow) lug (blue)

So, we can deduce that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> Replicates the color of the word that precedes it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the input-output pairs for common patterns.

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red
- The output colors correspond to each input word, with ""walm"" generating three reds.

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
- Again, the colors correspond to the input words. ""Walm"" is followed by three yellows which match the preceding word ""zup.""

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red
- ""Walm"" produces green which is the color for ""dax,"" the preceding word.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" and yields three reds, which correspond to the color for ""wif.""

Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in three greens, the color linked to ""dax.""

From the examples, it seems that ""walm"" essentially repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word thrice in the output sequence.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Every instance where ""lug"" is present in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output at the same position.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in every example provided.
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" Regardless of the position of ""wif"" within the input sequence or the other words accompanying it, the output ""red"" remains associated with ""wif."" Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow"" regardless of the context it is used in. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" means ""yellow"".
bluf -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" correlates with the color ""blue"" in the presented examples.
walm -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, ""walm"" seems to be a rule that means ""repeat the previously mentioned color."" Each time ""walm"" is used, the previously mentioned color in the sequence is repeated for the remaining items or until another color word is mentioned.

Rule: Repeat the last mentioned color.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" directly translates to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" is used in an input, ""blue"" appears in the output in the corresponding position.

Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color green irrespective of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" seems to translate to the color ""red"" consistently:

- When ""wif"" is paired with ""dax,"" the output is ""red green."" This implies that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- When ""wif"" appears with ""zup"" and ""lug,"" the output is ""yellow red blue,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" likely corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
- In the input where ""wif"" appears twice: ""wif dax wif,"" the output is ""red green red,"" which again suggests ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- When ""wif"" appears on its own, the output is simply ""red.""
- With the input ""wif walm,"" the output is ""red red red."" Since no other colors are introduced, it's reasonable to deduce that ""walm"" also corresponds to ""red.""

Given these observations, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position or repetition in the input.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently maps to the color ""yellow"" in every example.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rule about the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"":

Each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow"" followed by as many repetitions of ""yellow"" as there are words preceding ""bluf"". No words following ""bluf"" in the input seem to affect its associated output.

Here are the relevant examples that can help us understand the pattern:

- Input: zup bluf | Output: yellow yellow | Rule: 1 word before bluf, so ""yellow"" is repeated once after the initial ""yellow"".
- Input: zup wif bluf | Output: yellow red red | Rule: 2 words before bluf, so ""yellow"" is repeated twice, but because ""wif"" translates as ""red,"" we see ""red"" in place of the second ""yellow"".
- Input: wif dax zup bluf | Output: red green yellow yellow | Rule: 3 words before bluf, so ""yellow"" should be repeated thrice, but the translations of ""wif"" (red) and ""dax"" (green) are fixed, leaving only the ""zup"" before ""bluf"" to become an additional ""yellow"".
- Input: dax bluf wif zup | Output: green green red yellow | Rule: 1 word before bluf, so ""yellow"" should be repeated once. The word ""wif"" comes after ""bluf"" hence has no impact on the count of ""yellow"".
- Input: dax wif bluf | Output: green red red | Rule: 2 words before bluf, so ""yellow"" should be repeated twice, but the ""wif"" takes precedence as ""red"".

Based on this pattern, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" is as follows:

Rule: When ""bluf"" appears in the input, output ""yellow"" plus as many repetitions of ""yellow"" as there are words before ""bluf"" in the input, with each word's designated color substituting for ""yellow"" if applicable. Words after ""bluf"" do not influence its output.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the output for each instance of ""walm"" within the given examples:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red.""
2. When ""walm"" is before ""lug,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
3. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""
4. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""dax,"" the output is still ""red red red.""
5. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" without any other context, the output is again ""red red red.""

From these examples, it becomes clear that irrespective of the words following ""walm,"" the output words associated with ""walm"" itself are a repetition of the color associated with the word directly preceding it. For example, after ""dax,"" the color is ""green,"" and hence ""walm"" results in ""green green green."" After ""wif,"" the color is ""red,"" producing ""red red red"" for ""walm."" Lastly, when ""walm"" occurs after ""zup,"" it produces ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Rule: walm -> Replicates the color output of the word that directly precedes it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,39
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sentence.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- When ""zup"" is mentioned, the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""dax"" is mentioned, the output is ""green.""
- When ""lug"" is mentioned, the output is ""blue.""
- When ""wif"" is mentioned alone or after other words, the output is ""red.""
- When ""walm"" is mentioned, the output is ""green green green.""

Given these examples, when ""wif"" appears, regardless of its position in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" each time it appears in the input.
Rule: bluf -> red when following wif, otherwise blue.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the output color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here are the associations based on the inputs and outputs:

- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"", with ""zup"" being associated with ""yellow"" and then ""walm"" repeating it thrice.
- ""wif lug dax walm"" results in ""red blue green green green"", with ""dax"" associated with ""green"" and ""walm"" repeating it three times.
- Similarly, ""dax walm"" gives ""green green green"", with ""dax"" linked to ""green"" and ""walm"" repeating it three times.
- ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" leads to ""blue blue blue green red blue red"", where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated three times before moving on to the next words.
- ""dax lug walm"" produces ""green blue blue blue"", with ""lug"" connected to ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeating the ""blue"" thrice.

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue."" It appears that ""lug"" is substitutable for ""blue"" in every instance provided, irrespective of the surrounding context.

Rule: lug -> ""blue""
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in every provided example.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context.
zup -> yellow

Rule:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" No matter the context, whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output. Therefore, the deduced meaning of ""zup"" is simply the color yellow.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" changes the color mentioned before it to red, if there is an associated color, and repeats that color for the number of times ""bluf"" appears. If ""bluf"" follows a word without an associated color, it takes the color of the last color word mentioned or, if none is available, ""bluf"" defaults to yellow. Here's the breakdown:

1. In ""dax walm wif bluf,"" ""dax"" is green, ""walm"" is also green, ""wif"" has no associated color, so when followed by ""bluf,"" ""wif"" becomes red and then ""bluf"" repeats the red.
2. In ""zup lug bluf wif,"" ""zup"" is yellow, ""lug"" is blue, and then ""bluf"" changes the previous color blue to red, but with ""wif"" having no associated color, it does not change.
3. In ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" is yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats the yellow since no color word precedes it.
4. In ""dax wif bluf,"" ""dax"" is green, ""wif"" has no associated color, so it becomes red by the rule of ""bluf"" and then ""bluf"" repeats the red.
5. In ""zup bluf lug zup,"" ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" repeats the yellow, ""lug"" is blue, and the final ""zup"" brings it back to yellow.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" changes the previous color to red if the preceding word corresponds to a color. Otherwise, it takes the color of the last mentioned color word. If ""bluf"" is the first word or no colors have been mentioned before it, it defaults to yellow. Also, ""bluf"" repeats the color change it imposes for its occurrence.

bluf -> meaning: Convert the preceding color to red and repeat it; if no color precedes, default or continue with the last mentioned color.
Looking at the examples given, the color output following ""walm"" seems to depend on the word that comes before ""walm"":

- When ""zup"" comes before ""walm"", the output for ""walm"" is yellow.
- When ""lug"" comes before ""walm"", the output for ""walm"" is red.
- When ""dax"" comes before ""walm"", the output for ""walm"" is green.

Additionally, every time ""walm"" is mentioned, it is repeated three times in the output except when the output sequence ends.

Let's break down the examples:

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
- ""zup walm"" -> yellow yellow yellow
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""dax wif"" -> green red

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
- ""lug walm"" -> blue blue blue
- ""dax wif"" -> green red
- ""lug wif"" -> blue red

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""dax wif"" -> green red
- ""walm lug"" -> red red (extra red due to sequence end after walm)
- ""lug zup walm"" -> red blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red
- ""zup dax walm"" -> yellow green green green
- ""lug wif"" -> blue red

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup walm"" -> yellow yellow yellow

Based on the above, we can induce the following rule:

Walm -> meaning:
Rule: The meaning of ""walm"" affects the output color produced three times, repeating the color associated with the immediately preceding word. If ""walm"" is followed by a word, the repetition is cut short to accommodate the next output.


    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif
    ",Output: blue red,blue red,True,41
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears alone, the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" appears after ""wif,"" the output is ""red green,"" with ""red"" corresponding to ""wif.""
- When ""dax"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue green,"" with ""blue"" corresponding to ""lug.""
- When the sequence ""wif dax wif"" appears, the output follows the same pattern as the individual words: ""red green red.""
- In the sequence ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf,"" the words yield outputs ""blue red red green blue blue"" respectively, preserving the consistent mapping from previous examples.

Given these examples, it's reasonable to deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position or the words around it. Each word in the input is associated with a specific color in the output, and ""dax"" seems to maintain its meaning consistently.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, it seems that each nonce word is associated with a specific color. Here's the apparent matching:

- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red
- dax -> green

Given that ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red"" regardless of its position or surrounding words, we can deduce that:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" represents the color red.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" is consistent across all examples. In each instance, ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds with the color that follows the pattern from the previous non-""bluf"" word. The pattern for the colors associated with the non-""bluf"" words seems to be as follows: 

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" (since ""dax walm wif bluf"" outputs ""green green green red red,"" we can infer that ""walm"" also corresponds to ""green"").

So, ""bluf"" takes on the color that comes right after the word that preceded ""bluf"".

For instance:
- In ""zup bluf dax,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" followed by a green for ""dax.""
- In ""dax zup bluf,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" after ""zup.""
- In ""dax walm wif bluf,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" so ""bluf"" is ""red,"" after both instances of ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""walm.""
- In ""zup bluf wif dax lug,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" so ""bluf"" is ""red,"" between yellow for ""zup"" and green for ""dax.""
- In ""lug wif lug dax bluf,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" so ""bluf"" is ""green,"" after the green for ""dax.""

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning. The word ""bluf"" results in the color corresponding to the word immediately before it in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, we can deduct a rule for the word ""walm."" In each example, the presence of the word ""walm"" appears to correspond to a repetition of the color immediately before ""walm.""

Let's look at the examples to identify the pattern:

- In the first example, before ""walm,"" the color is ""red,"" then after ""walm,"" it becomes ""red red.""
- In the second example, before ""walm,"" the color is ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" it becomes ""blue blue.""
- In the third example, before ""walm,"" the color is ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" we have ""blue blue.""
- In the fourth example, before ""walm,"" the color is ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" it is ""red red.""
- In the fifth example, before ""walm,"" the color is ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" it becomes ""blue blue.""

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color immediately before it to be repeated twice after it.

Rule: walm -> causes the previous color to be repeated twice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

Rule: bluf -> green
Based on the provided examples, there appears to be a direct correlation between the nonce word ""walm"" and the output colors that follow it. Each instance of ""walm"" appears to result in repeating red colors immediately after its occurrence. The number of red colors that follow ""walm"" varies based on the example, but it's always exclusively red with no other color interspersed.

Considering the surrounding words don't appear to influence the sequence of reds that follow ""walm"" (given that before ""walm"" we see varied colors but the sequence after ""walm"" is consistently red), we can induce a rule about ""walm"":

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output to be ""red"" repeated for as many times as the word ""walm"" is iterated, uninterrupted by other colors.

Therefore,

walm -> Output a sequence of red colors.

4. Input: ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" corresponds with Output: ""yellow red red yellow blue""
5. Input: ""zup bluf lug"" corresponds with Output: ""yellow yellow blue""

Upon analyzing the pattern, in every instance the output immediately following ""bluf"" is ""red"". This suggests that ""bluf"" may translate directly to ""red,"" regardless of the preceding or following words.

For clarity, here's how ""bluf"" fits within the context of the patterns:

1. ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" (which is actually the same as the output for ""zup,"" but we can suspect that could be due to a pattern repetition or a coincidence, since other examples help clarify; let's see more examples to rule out coincidence).
2. ""bluf"" follows ""lug wif"" and the output is ""red"" immediately after ""bluf"" is mentioned.
3. ""bluf"" is at the end of the string, after multiple words, and again, ""red"" is the last word in the output sequence.
4. ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"", but the output following ""bluf"" is still ""red"", not ""yellow"" which is the output for ""zup"". This rejection of the previous word's color by ""bluf"" hints that ""bluf"" imposes its own color in the output sequence.
5. ""bluf"" is in the middle and the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" but again the output follows with ""red"" right after and before a different output which is blue for ""lug"".

Thus, if we consider the immediate consistency of ""red"" after ""bluf"" regardless of the preceding word, we can deduce the rule as follows:

Rule: bluf -> red
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with the color that corresponds to the previous word in the sequence, with repetitions of that color thrice. Below is the breakdown of the pattern:

- In Example 1, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" following ""wif"" results in ""red red red"".
- In Example 2, ""dax walm"" yields ""green green green"", indicating that ""walm"" takes the color of ""dax"", which is ""green"".
- In Example 3, ""dax walm"" again results in ""green green green"", and later ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", suggesting that ""walm"" adopts the color of ""lug"", which is ""blue"".
- In Example 4, ""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue"", reinforcing the previous observation.
- In Example 5, ""dax walm"" following ""lug"" and ""wif"" yields ""green green green"", indicating that ""walm"" adopts the color of ""dax"", not the colors before it in the sequence.

From these observations, the rule appears to be: ""walm"" takes the color associated with the immediate word before it and repeats that color three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, it appears that each unique word translates to a specific color. We can determine the color each word corresponds to by analyzing the input and output patterns. Here is the breakdown:

- When ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.
- When ""walm"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.
- When ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- When ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.
- When ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.

In every instance where ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output. There is no variability with the occurrence of ""dax"" that would suggest a different meaning. It doesn't seem to depend on any context or surrounding words.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green
Based on the provided examples where the word ""wif"" is used and the outputs that correspond to each input, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be consistent across all examples. The input word ""wif"" always results in the output ""red"", regardless of other words' positions or meanings.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" appears to translate to the color ""yellow"". Rule: ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
bluf -> repeat the color word that corresponds to the word preceding bluf.

Rule: 
1. When a color word (e.g., ""wif"" for ""red"") is immediately followed by the word ""bluf,"" the output is the corresponding color word repeated twice.
2. If a non-color word precedes ""bluf"" (e.g., ""zup""), and there are no color words between that non-color word and ""bluf,"" there is no direct output for ""bluf."" Instead, ""bluf"" influences the output of the non-color word by providing a semantic context for repetition.
3. When the word ""bluf"" is preceded by both non-color and color word(s), the rule of repetition applies to the color word(s), and the non-color word influences the sequence but not the repetition or color.
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to induce the rule governing the word ""walm"". Let's analyze the examples and the respective outputs given, focusing specifically on the pattern changes when ""walm"" is introduced:

1. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> red red red green yellow
2. ""zup walm dax"" -> yellow yellow yellow green
3. ""wif walm"" -> red red red
4. ""zup dax walm"" -> yellow green green green
5. ""dax lug walm"" -> green blue blue blue

Observing the patterns, we can see the following:

- Without ""walm"", the words ""wif"", ""zup"", and ""dax"" correspond to a single color: ""wif"" to red, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""dax"" to green.
- The introduction of ""walm"" changes the output such that all the words preceeding ""walm"" become the same color, and that color is the one corresponding to the first word in the sequence.

With this information, we can infer the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes all preceding words to take on the color associated with the first word in the sequence until ""walm"" appears.

Therefore:

walm -> causes all preceding words to change to the color of the first word before walm.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm zup
    ",Output: red red red yellow,red red red yellow,True,45
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Every instance of ""dax"" in the input leads to the word ""green"" in the output.
Analyzing the examples:

1. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: wif dax zup dax
   Output: red green yellow green

3. Input: dax zup wif zup
   Output: green yellow red yellow

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

5. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue

Based on the above examples, whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the first color produced in the output is ""red"". Also, ""wif"" does not seem to have any additional impact on subsequent colors; those appear to be determined by the other words following it.

Taking each example:

1. After ""wif"" we have two reds, but this repetition could correspond to the word ""walm"" rather than because of ""wif"".
2. ""wif"" is followed by one instance of ""red"", and the next colors follow the pattern established by ""dax"" and ""zup"".
3. Similarly, ""wif"" is followed by a single ""red"", with the rest of the pattern not affected by ""wif"".
4. There are two ""reds"", but this is the first occurrence of ""bluf"", so it is not clear if ""wif"" induces the second ""red"" or ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".
5. Again, ""wif"" is followed by a single ""red"", with the next color (""blue"") seemingly determined by ""lug"".

So by induction, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" every time it appears. Whatever comes after ""wif"" seems to follow its own rule for color assignment, independent of the presence of ""wif"".

Thus, 
wif -> meaning. 
Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word 'zup' appears in the input, it translates to 'yellow' in the output. This is consistent across all examples provided.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the word ""blue,"" but it duplicates the color adjective that precedes it (i.e., ""bluf"" repeats the previous color word or, in the absence of a previous color word, defaults to ""blue"").

Explanation: In each example, the use of ""bluf"" results in the appearance of two identical color words in the output.

- In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" repeats this color, resulting in ""green green.""
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" repeats this color, thus ""red red.""
- In instances where ""bluf"" is preceded by a non-color word (like ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue""), ""bluf"" acts as a color word and uses the color ""blue"" by default.

Therefore: bluf -> ""repeats the previous color word or defaults to 'blue'""
walm -> green

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is present in the input, the following words are translated to the color ""green"" until a different color word appears or the input ends. If ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output for ""dax"" is ""green"" instead of its usual ""yellow."" If ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output for ""wif"" is ""green"" instead of its usual ""red."" If ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output for ""lug"" is ""green"" instead of the usual ""blue."" If ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" the output for ""zup"" remains ""yellow,"" which is consistent with the output of ""zup"" when not preceded by ""walm."" If ""walm"" is the last in sequence or not followed by a specific color word, it is given the output ""green.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug means blue.
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". Each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output, regardless of the presence or order of other words.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of what other words accompany it. The presence of ""zup"" consistently produces the output ""yellow,"" and it appears as the first color in the sequence when combined with other words.

Rule: The word ""zup"" means ""yellow"". Additional words following ""zup"", such as ""dax"" and ""wif"", correspond to additional colors added to the output sequence in the order they appear. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following pattern:

- In the first example, ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" results in ""yellow red red yellow blue"". We can see that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue"". Given that ""wif"" translates to ""red"", we can deduce that ""bluf"" caused the output to repeat the previous color word.
- The second example, ""wif bluf"", yields ""red red"" which confirms the idea that ""bluf"" repeats the previous color word.
- In the third example, ""zup bluf wif"", the output is ""yellow yellow red,"" supporting the earlier deduction that ""bluf"" repeats the previous color word, since ""zup"" is ""yellow"".
- The fourth example, ""lug bluf"", translates to ""blue blue"" which further confirms that ""bluf"" repeats the previous color mentioned.
- The last example, ""lug bluf dax bluf"", has an output of ""blue blue green green"". Here we observe the introduction of a new word ""dax"" which translates to ""green"". ""Bluf"" is seen to still be repeating the previous color word, ""blue"" in the first instance and ""green"" in the second.

With this consistent pattern across all examples, the rule for ""bluf"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color word that comes immediately before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each example and identify patterns to figure out the rule.

1. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is green repeated three times.
2. When ""walm"" stands alone after ""dax,"" the output is still green repeated three times.
3. When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""lug"" comes before ""zup,"" the output is one yellow followed by blue repeated three times, indicating ""lug"" may trigger blue and ""zup"" may trigger ""walm"" to be yellow.
4. When ""wif"" precedes ""zup lug dax zup walm,"" ""wif"" has an output of red, and the sequence follows the pattern where ""zup"" yields yellow and ""lug"" follows with blue, ""dax"" yields green and ""zup"" again yields yellow, except the final ""walm"" causes the sequence to repeat yellow three times.
5. In the final example, ""wif"" yields red, ""walm"" repeats this, ""dax"" then yields green, ""zup"" yields yellow, and ""wif"" red. When ""lug"" appears, it yields blue, which is then repeated twice following the ""walm.""

From these patterns, we can observe that ""walm"" doesn't have a consistent color output by itself, but rather, it seems to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it three times. Therefore, ""walm"" functions as a repeater of the previous color three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color assigned to the word immediately preceding it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" is presented in the input, the output invariably contains ""red"".

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples provided, every time the nonce word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence. This suggests a direct substitution rule where ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
Given the examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color ""red"" when preceded by ""wif,"" and to ""blue"" when preceded by ""lug."" However, in the instances where it is preceded by ""dax"" or ""zup,"" the color that corresponds to ""bluf"" becomes the same color that corresponds to the preceding word.

Let's break down each line:

1. ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow,"" with the ""bluf"" corresponding to ""red,"" the same as ""wif.""
2. ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red,"" with ""bluf"" again corresponding to ""red,"" matching the color attributed to ""wif.""
3. ""zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue,"" with ""bluf"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" the same as ""zup.""
4. ""zup dax bluf"" translates to ""yellow green green,"" with ""bluf"" taking on the color green, matching ""dax.""
5. ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" with ""bluf"" once again corresponding to ""red,"" like ""wif.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it mimics the color of the word preceding it, with an exception when that word is ""lug,"" where ""bluf"" then becomes ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word, except when preceded by ""lug,"" in which case ""bluf"" means ""blue.""
Exploring the provided inputs and outputs, we can surmise a few patterns that could lead to understanding the rule(s) underlying the nonce word ""walm"".

1. The word ""walm"" always corresponds to a sequence of the same color in the output, and this color always matches the color directly preceding ""walm"".
   
   For example, in ""dax wif walm"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"", followed by ""walm"", which results in ""red red red"".

2. The number of times the color repeats in the output corresponds to the number of words from the start to the word ""walm"" itself, excluding ""walm"".

   For example, in ""zup dax lug walm zup"", there are three words before ""walm"", thus ""blue"" (the color corresponding to ""lug"", the word right before ""walm"") is repeated three times.

3. The word ""walm"" does not seem to correspond to a specific color but rather takes on the property of repetition from whatever word (color) comes just before it.

With this understanding, we derive the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color that immediately precedes it in the sequence the number of times equal to the count of words from the start of the sequence to the word ""walm"", excluding ""walm"" itself.

Therefore, walm -> repeat the preceding color as many times as there are words before ""walm"" in the sequence, not including ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in the output.
Rule: dax -> ""green""

The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in all the examples provided.
From the given examples, we can see that the output is a sequence of color names. Each instance of the nonce word ""wif"" in the input seems to correspond with the color ""red"" in the output. Therefore, we can induce that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's first look at the color outputs and their corresponding input words:

- When ""dax"" is the input, the output is ""green.""
- When ""lug"" is the input, the output is ""blue.""
- When ""zup"" is the input, the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""wif"" is the input, the output is ""red.""

Now, let's analyze the outputs when ""bluf"" is included:

- ""dax bluf"" yields ""green green,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, which is ""green"" in this case.
- ""lug bluf zup"" yields ""blue blue yellow,"" reinforcing the idea that ""bluf"" might repeat the color associated with the word right before it, which is ""blue.""
- ""wif zup bluf"" yields ""red yellow yellow,"" again pointing to ""bluf"" repeating the color of the word right before it, which is ""yellow"" (associated with ""zup"").
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" becomes a bit more complex; based on the previous hypothesis, ""bluf"" should repeat the color ""yellow,"" and the output confirms this. The rest of the sequence does not seem to affect ""bluf.""
- ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" yields ""green yellow blue yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and its output is ""yellow yellow,"" supporting the previous observations that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it.

Considering these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word that precedes ""bluf.""
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that each unique word (excluding ""walm"") corresponds to a color:

- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.

Now, let's analyze the occurrences of ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), and the output is three additional instances of blue.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), and the output is two additional instances of red.
- In the third example, two occurrences of ""walm"", both following ""dax"" (green) and ""wif"" (red) respectively, lead to two additional instances of their color.
- The fourth example is the same as the first one, with ""walm"" following ""lug"" resulting in three additional instances of blue.
- The fifth example is a repetition of the first example.

From these observations, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word, it repeats the color associated with that word three additional times.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

    ",Output: blue green red,blue green red,True,49
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

The given examples show that whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the output consistently includes the color ""green."" There is no example that contradicts this observation. Therefore, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words around it, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following correspondences between the nonce words and colors:

- ""zup"" seems to always correspond to the color ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" seems to consistently correspond to the color ""blue"".
- ""bluf"" appears to always correspond to the color ""red"".
- ""walm"" hasn't been directly defined but given the repeated pattern, it likely corresponds to ""blue"" (""walm"" appears once in the fourth input and results in an extra ""blue"" in the output).
- ""dax"" from the fifth input seems to correspond to ""green"".

Considering the pattern of the nonce word ""wif"", we see that it always corresponds to the color ""red"", regardless of its position in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

wif -> red
zup -> meaning. 

Rule: The word ""zup"" generates a sequence of colors that correspond to a previously mentioned set of words, each with its own color representation. When ""zup"" is mentioned, the colors for all the preceding words in the sequence are listed in the reverse order they were introduced. If a word is repeated, its color is also repeated in the output sequence for each occurrence.

- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""walm"" does not have a unique color, but seems to replicate the color of the word it follows.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow, which is the same color that ""zup"" represents. 

Thus, ""zup"" triggers a repetition of the colors already mentioned, in the reverse order, including the duplication effect of ""walm"".
Based on the given examples, it seems that each unique word corresponds to a unique color in the output. Let's break down the examples.

- Input: wif bluf lug zup -> Output: red red blue yellow
- Input: zup walm lug wif bluf -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
- Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
- Input: dax zup wif bluf lug -> Output: green yellow red red blue
- Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red

From these examples, when the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output an equal number of times. Therefore, ""bluf"" is consistently translated to ""red"". Additionally, ""wif"" also translates to ""red"", ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and ""dax"" translates to ""green"".

Based on this pattern:

Rule: bluf -> red
Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the word before it three times.

Based on the given examples, when the word ""walm"" appears after another word, the output is the color that corresponds to that word repeated three times. The color replications suggest that ""walm"" is an instruction to repeat the previously mentioned color. Here is how the rule applies to the examples provided:

Example 1: ""zup walm wif""
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, followed by ""walm"", hence ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- Then ""wif"" corresponds to red.

Example 2: ""zup walm dax""
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, followed by ""walm"", hence ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- Then ""dax"" corresponds to green.

Example 3: ""dax walm wif walm""
- ""dax"" corresponds to green, followed by ""walm"", hence ""green"" is repeated three times.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red, followed by ""walm"", hence ""red"" is repeated three times.

Example 4: ""wif walm dax zup""
- ""wif"" corresponds to red, followed by ""walm"", hence ""red"" is repeated three times.
- ""dax"" corresponds to green, followed by ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow.

Example 5: ""zup wif walm lug""
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" corresponds to red, followed by ""walm"" and thus ""red"" is repeated three times.
- ""lug"" is a new word that corresponds to blue (not seen in previous examples but can be deduced by the context).

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is to take the color associated with the previous word and repeat that color three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently maps to the color ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, each input word seems to correspond to a specific output color. The word ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green."" 

Looking at other words:
- The word ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red.""
- The word ""zup"" consistently results in the output ""yellow.""
- The word ""bluf"" when it occurred (in the fourth and fifth examples), the output was ""red"" and ""green"" respectively which correspond to the words preceding it (""wif"" and ""dax""). This could imply that ""bluf"" perhaps takes the color of the preceding word or duplicates it.
- The word ""lug"" only appeared once and led to the color ""blue.""

Using this analysis, we can deduce the following rule:
dax -> meaning. The meaning is ""green."" Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output will be ""green.""
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" Each example shows that no matter the position of ""wif"" within the input sequence, the output invariably includes ""red"" in the corresponding position. Other words, such as ""lug"" and ""zup,"" correspond to ""blue"" and ""yellow"" respectively, while ""dax"" translates to ""green."" These consistent pairings allow us to conclude that ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. 

Rule: zup translates to the color yellow.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that precedes it. Here is the rule:

- In the first input, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and is followed by ""bluf,"" which also translates to ""yellow.""
- In the second input, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" leading to ""bluf"" also translating to ""blue.""
- In the third input, ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" and translates to ""blue,"" which is the color associated with ""lug.""
- In the fourth input, ""bluf"" once again follows ""wif,"" translating to ""red,"" which is the color associated with ""wif.""
- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" translating to ""green,"" which is the color associated with ""dax.""

Taking into account these observations, we can define the meaning of ""bluf"" as such:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: If a color word is followed by ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" translates to that same color.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"".

Input: dax walm  
Output: green green green  
Here, ""walm"" produces three ""green"".

Input: lug wif dax zup walm  
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow  
In this example, after ""zup"" the word ""walm"" produces three ""yellow"".

Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug  
Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue  
Again, ""walm"" after ""zup"" yields three ""yellow"" followed by the continuation of the pattern related to the other words.

Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm  
Output: green green green red blue green green green  
In this string, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" twice and each time it produces three ""green"".

Input: zup walm wif  
Output: yellow yellow yellow red  
Once more, ""walm"" after ""zup"" gives us three ""yellow"".

From these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" produces a repetition of three times the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of the context in which it appears.
Rule: dax -> green

This rule is derived from the direct mapping observed in each example, where the presence of ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output. Regardless of its position in the input or the other words around it, ""dax"" consistently results in ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" when translated to an output. It maintains its meaning regardless of its position or surrounding words in the input.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the provided examples.
bluf -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, we can infer that the meaning of ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""green red"" regardless of its position in the sequence. It does not seem to modify based on the surrounding words, as its output remains constant even when the context changes. Therefore, we can derive the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the output ""green red"" in all instances.
Given the outputs for each input line, it seems that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. Since the input is a combination of different words and ""walm"" appears multiple times, it is reasonable to infer that ""walm"" also corresponds to a color. To figure out which color it corresponds to, we can look for patterns in each line.

- In the first line, the word ""dax"" appears once and corresponds to ""green,"" the word ""lug"" appears once and corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" appears once and also corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the second line, exactly the same words in the input give the same output as in the first line, reinforcing our idea that each word has a specific color associated with it.
- In the third line, ""zup"" appears twice and corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" appears once at the end and corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" appears once and corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth line, ""wif"" appears once and corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" appears once and corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" appears once and corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" appears once and corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth line, ""lug"" appears twice and corresponds to ""blue"" each time, ""wif"" appears once and corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" appears once, corresponding to ""blue.""

Through these examples, the exact meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" seems inconsistent, which makes it difficult to provide an exact rule or definition for ""walm"" based solely on color correspondence. However, if we observe the positions where ""walm"" occurs, we can notice that ""walm"" takes on the color of the immediately preceding word:

- In the first and the second lines ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the color is blue.
- In the third and the fourth lines, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the color is yellow.
- In the fifth line, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the color is blue again.

Therefore, it seems that ""walm"" may mean ""repeat the color of the preceding word.""

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
After closely reviewing the input and corresponding output examples, the rule can be inferred as follows:

lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: When the input contains the word ""dax,"" the output is ""green."" This is consistent regardless of the position or number of times ""dax"" appears in the input.
Based on the provided examples, the word 'wif' consistently translates to the color 'red'. The transformation seems to be independent of the surrounding context, as 'wif' always results in 'red', no matter the position or the words before or after it in the sequence. 'Dax' consistently translates to 'green', and 'lug' to 'blue', 'zup' to 'yellow', while 'walm' seems to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

The examples seem to consistently associate the nonce word ""zup"" with the color ""yellow"". Each occurrence of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
Rule: ""bluf"" repeatedly outputs the colors that correspond to the preceding words, one output color for each occurrence of each word before it in the sequence. Each given word that precedes ""bluf"" has a corresponding color as follows:
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- The word ""lug"" was not given before a ""bluf"", so its corresponding output color after ""bluf"" is uncertain from the given examples.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it triggers the repetition of the output colors for the words that come before it in the same sequence, with each color being repeated once for each occurrence of the word.

Bluf -> Meaning: Repeat the corresponding output colors for each word that precedes it, with repeats equal to the number of times each word appears.
By analyzing the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" We must look at a series of input-output pairs to identify any patterns that allow us to determine the rule that applies when the word ""walm"" is used:

1. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
2. ""dax walm zup"" -> ""green green green yellow""
3. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
4. ""wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow""
5. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""

The word ""walm"" appears in each input example and is followed by a repetition of a color in the output. The number of repeated color outputs corresponds to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence. More specifically, the position of ""walm"" indicates the number of times the preceding color word is repeated in the output. Additionally, ""walm"" is followed by another color if there is another word after it in the input sequence. Here are the observed patterns:

- ""wif walm"" repeats ""red"" three times because ""walm"" is the second word.
- ""dax walm"" repeats ""green"" three times because ""walm"" is the second word, followed by ""yellow"" because of the following ""zup.""
- ""zup walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times because ""walm"" is the second word.
- ""wif walm zup"" repeats ""red"" three times because ""walm"" is the second word, followed by ""yellow"" because of ""zup.""
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" repeats ""green"" three times because ""walm"" is the fourth word, following ""wif bluf dax.""

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the previous color word to be repeated as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence. If there is another word after ""walm,"" then that word is represented by a single color in the sequence.

Therefore:
walm -> Causes the previous color word to be repeated as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence, with an additional color added if followed by another word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output. Here is the rule deduced from the given examples:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"". In every output, the presence of the word ""zup"" in the input results in the word ""yellow"" appearing in the output. Here is the breakdown:

- Input ""zup wif"" corresponds to output ""yellow red"". The word ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".
- In input ""wif walm dax zup"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""walm"" also appears to correspond to ""red"", ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- For input ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

Rule:
- zup -> means ""yellow"".
Based on the examples provided, where the word ""bluf"" appears in the sequences, the output consistently contains two consecutive instances of the color ""yellow."" Accordingly, we can deduce that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to double yellow in the output.

Rule: bluf -> two instances of the color yellow.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to result in the output of a sequence of colors, where the number of repetitions of the color corresponds to the number of terms appearing before ""walm"".

Let's examine each example:

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Analysis: The word ""dax"" outputs ""green"" and ""lug"" outputs ""blue,"" but since ""walm"" comes after these two, the last color (""blue"") is repeated three times.

2. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
   Analysis: ""Walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" hence it repeats ""green"" three times. Then ""lug"" appears resulting in an additional ""blue.""

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Analysis: ""Zup"" gives ""yellow"" and ""wif"" gives ""red."" ""Walm"" causes ""red"" to appear three times, repeating the color that appears before it.

4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" which outputs ""blue,"" resulting in ""blue"" being repeated three times.

5. Input: dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: The first ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and repeats it three times. The second ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and repeats it three times.

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes the color corresponding to the word directly preceding it and repeats that color as many times as there are total words preceding ""walm"" in the sequence.

Rule: If the word before ""walm"" corresponds to color X, and there are N words before ""walm,"" then the output is the color X repeated N times. 

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word as many times as there are words before ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the given context.
Rule: dax -> green

Explanation:
Each usage of the word ""dax"" in the context provided is translated to the color ""green"" in the output.
Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's analyze each input-output pair and find the correlation between the two.

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue
2. Input: zup bluf wif dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow red green blue
3. Input: zup wif zup -> Output: yellow red yellow
4. Input: lug zup dax wif -> Output: blue yellow green red
5. Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow

By examining the patterns, we notice that:

- Each input word corresponds to a distinct color in the output.
- The word ""zup"" is used multiple times in different contexts and corresponds to the color ""yellow"" each time.
- Other words in the input such as ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"" also correlate consistently to specific colors—red, blue, blue, and green respectively.

Based on this, the rule seems to be that every nonce word in the input has a direct color translation in the output, and the word ""zup"" specifically translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" follows another word, the output color for ""bluf"" is the same as the color output for the word right before ""bluf.""
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the immediately preceding word. For instance, when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which suggests that ""walm"" causes the color paired with ""zup"" (yellow) to be repeated three times. Similarly, after ""lug"" and ""dax,"" ""walm"" leads to the colors blue and green being repeated respectively.

Let's examine the evidence:

Input 1 & 3: The word ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow) and results in three ""yellow"" in the output.

Input 2: In this example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" again and results in three ""yellow"" in the output, consistent with Input 1 & 3.

Input 4: Here ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which corresponds to blue) and leads to ""blue blue blue"" in the output.

Input 5: In this example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which corresponds to green) and the output is ""green blue blue blue,"" indicating that the last blue is the result of ""lug"" and not ""walm"" as it is not repeated. This means ""walm"" causes the replication of the color related to ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

The rule can be generalized as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following pattern:

1. Each word in the input is mapped to a particular color in the output.
2. The word 'zup' is consistently mapped to the color 'yellow'.
3. The word 'wif' is consistently mapped to the color 'red'.
4. The introduced nonce word 'dax' is consistently mapped to the color 'green'.
5. The new word 'lug' in the final example is consistently mapped to the color 'blue'.
6. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the words and colors, suggesting that position or repetition does not alter the assigned color for each unique word.
7. No other context or modifiers seem to affect the color assignment for any given word.

Rule: dax -> green. Each unique word directly translates to a specific color regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it seems the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the word ""red"" consistently in the output. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: Zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to correlate the positions of ""bluf"" in the inputs with the corresponding outputs:

1. dax bluf wif zup lug -> green green red yellow blue
2. wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> red red yellow red blue green
3. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
4. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
5. zup bluf -> yellow yellow

Keeping the position of ""bluf"" in mind, it appears that ""bluf"" correlates with a color in each instance. The outputs before and after ""bluf"" change, whereas the color associated with ""bluf"" remains the same. The common factor is that whenever ""bluf"" is present, the color ""yellow"" appears in the output, specifically right after ""bluf"" appears.

Therefore, based on the provided examples:

Rule: bluf -> yellow
Rule: ""walm"" means repeating the color associated with the previous word two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Each instance of ""lug"" in the input is correlated with the color ""blue"" in the output. There doesn't seem to be any context-dependent variation or additional complexity based on the information provided.
Rule: dax -> green

The examples consistently show that whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output, irrespective of the position of ""dax"" in the sequence. This suggests that ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
From the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
bluf -> yellow

Rule: When ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow"". Regardless of its position in the sequence, ""bluf"" always results in the color ""yellow"" being outputted.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the outputs associated with each input and try to determine a pattern.

1. Input: wif walm dax zup | Output: red red red green yellow
2. Input: zup walm dax | Output: yellow yellow yellow green
3. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif | Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
4. Input: zup lug walm | Output: yellow blue blue blue
5. Input: wif dax zup walm | Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

Firstly, each individual word in the inputs seems to correspond to a specific color in the outputs.

Observations:

- ""wif"" always leads to ""red.""
- ""dax"" always leads to ""green.""
- ""zup"" always leads to ""yellow.""

Now, looking specifically at ""walm,"" we can see that it yields to different outputs, but notably, there's a distinct rule:

- ""walm"" always results in the color that the previous word corresponds to. 

For example:
- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" resulting in ""walm"" also being ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (a new word not seen in previous examples), which corresponds to ""blue,"" hence ""walm"" also results in ""blue.""
- In the second and third examples, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" making ""walm"" also result in ""yellow.""

Rule: walm -> takes on the color corresponding to the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue"" regardless of the context. Therefore, the rule is straightforward:

lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. We can infer the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green

The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in every example where it appears.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to ""red"" in each instance it appears.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow in the given examples.
Based on the given examples, each instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. The rule seems to be consistent across different combinations of words. There is no context given that changes the output associated with ""bluf."" Additionally, the word preceding ""bluf"" does not seem to affect its corresponding output. Therefore, the induction suggests that:

Rule: bluf -> red
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's break down the patterns found in the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green
2. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
3. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
4. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

Looking at these examples, we can see that each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

In each case where ""walm"" appears, all other words that appear before ""walm"" in the sequence are repeated in the output before the sequence diverges with a new color. This suggests that ""walm"" prompts a repetition of the colors corresponding to the words that preceeded ""walm"" in the sequence, up to that point. After ""walm"" executes its function, the pattern of colors resumes as direct mappings from the remaining words in the input sequence:

1. ""dax"" is green, so, after ""dax walm"", we have ""green green green"" and then the pattern diverges with ""wif dax"" becoming ""red green"".
2. ""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" is yellow, so ""lug zup walm lug"" becomes ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"", with repetition of ""blue yellow"" followed by ""lug"".
3. ""dax"" being green and ""lug"" being blue, after ""dax lug walm,"" we get ""green blue blue blue"", then the pattern changes with ""zup wif"" becoming ""yellow red"".
4. ""dax"" is green and ""wif"" is red, so after ""dax walm,"" we have ""green green green"" and the pattern changes with ""wif zup"" being ""red yellow"".
5. ""lug"" is blue, therefore, ""lug walm"" simply translates to ""blue blue blue"", with the repetition of ""blue"".

Given the patterns in the outputs and the specific function of ""walm"" in facilitating this repetition, we can define:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. Causes the repetition of the colors that correspond to the preceding words, up to the point where ""walm"" appears. After ""walm"" has been used, the output reverts to direct color translations of the remaining words.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue."" No matter the context in which ""lug"" appears, the output is always ""blue."" Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" is as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following rule:

dax -> green

This means whenever the input contains the word ""dax"", the output will always include ""green"". There doesn't seem to be any context dependency or change in the meaning of ""dax"" across the examples; it consistently corresponds to the color green.

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, the output will include ""green"".
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Thus, we can formulate the following rule:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" always translates to the color ""red.""
Rule: zup -> yellow

The consistent output associated with the presence of the nonce word ""zup"" indicates that it translates to the color ""yellow"". In all given inputs, whenever ""zup"" appears, the output includes the word ""yellow"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" follows a pattern where it translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Each input containing the word ""bluf"" consistently results in an output that includes ""green"" at the same position where ""bluf"" is found in the input.

Thus, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: bluf -> green
After analyzing the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" is associated with a repeated output:

- Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue (3 times blue)
- Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red (3 times red)
- Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> Output: green blue blue blue green red red green (3 times blue after lug and 2 times red after wif while sandwiched between greens associated with dax)
- Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue (3 times blue after lug, preceded by green)

The repetition count is consistent: three times the color associated with the word before ""walm"". ""Lug"" is followed by ""blue"" thrice, ""wif"" by ""red"" thrice, and when ""dax"" is around but not directly before ""walm"" it does not change the repetition count.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the following rule can be deduced:

Rule: dax -> green

Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green"".
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the given examples and their outputs. We notice that whenever ""wif"" is present, the color ""red"" appears in the output. Moreover, ""wif"" does not appear to have a positional effect on the output, as it can be at the start or in the middle of the input, but ""red"" consistently appears in the output.

Furthermore, the examples do not show a case where ""wif"" corresponds to more than one particular color or set of colors other than ""red."" Therefore, based on the given data, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Based on the provided examples:

Input: zup lug -> Output: yellow blue
Input: lug zup dax zup -> Output: blue yellow green yellow
Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
Input: zup dax wif -> Output: yellow green red
Input: dax zup lug bluf -> Output: green yellow blue blue

Here is what we can deduce:

- The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""blue"" like ""lug,"" indicating that ""bluf"" is also an alternative indication for ""blue.""
- The word ""wif"" only appears once and translates to ""red.""

From these patterns, we can see that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words around it. 

Rule: zup -> yellow
From the provided examples, each instance of ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to a repetition in the output of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf"". Here is the breakdown:

1. ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red"": The word before ""bluf"" is ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"". In the output, ""red"" is repeated twice.
2. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"": The word before ""bluf"" is ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"". In the output, ""yellow"" is repeated twice.
3. ""wif zup dax bluf"" -> ""red yellow green green"": The word before ""bluf"" is ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"". In the output, ""green"" is repeated twice.
4. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"": The word before ""bluf"" is ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"". In the output, ""green"" is repeated twice.
5. ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" -> ""green red green yellow yellow"": The word before ""bluf"" is ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"". In the output, ""yellow"" is repeated twice.

Rule:
bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"", repeated twice.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs to find a pattern.

Looking at each input and output:

1. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
   This suggests that ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" might mean repeating the color word that precedes it twice more, since ""yellow"" is repeated three times in total.

2. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
   Here ""dax"" seems to mean ""green"" and ""lug"" means ""blue,"" following the rule that ""walm"" repeats the color word that precedes it twice more, ""blue"" is repeated three times.

3. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
   In this one, ""dax"" still means ""green"" and ""lug"" still means ""blue."" ""Walm"" repeats the ""blue"" twice more. ""Zup"" means ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" introduces a new color ""red.""

4. zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green
   ""Zup"" means ""yellow,"" ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" twice more, and ""dax"" is ""green.""

5. zup bluf lug zup walm -> yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Here, ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" seems to be a typo or another word meaning ""yellow."" ""Lug"" means ""blue,"" but there is no ""blue"" after ""lug,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" is not related to the output color ""blue."" This confirms that ""walm"" repeats the previous color, which is ""yellow"" in this case, twice more.

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it two more times.

Thus:
walm -> Repetition of the preceding color word two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently replaced with the color ""blue"" in each given example, regardless of its position within the input sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color green regardless of the context in which it is used.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif"" we need to carefully compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs, looking for a pattern. 

Looking at the examples:

1. ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" becomes ""blue green green red green."" The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" as seen consistently across the examples. The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" ""bluf"" has appeared twice, corresponding to ""green"" when before ""wif"" and ""red"" after ""wif."" Thus, ""wif"" appears to cause the color that follows it to be ""red"" instead of its usual corresponding color.

2. ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red green red red."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green"" again, and ""bluf"" which would be ""green"" normally is ""red"" after ""wif"" again. Thus ""wif"" seems to change the following color to ""red.""

3. ""wif dax lug dax"" becomes ""red green blue green."" Here, ""wif"" precedes ""dax"" which again results in ""red.""

4. ""dax wif bluf"" leads to ""green red red."" ""Dax"" is once again ""green,"" and ""wif"" before ""bluf"" turns ""bluf"" into ""red."" 

5. ""wif walm"" turns into ""red red red."" This example doesn't provide much new information as both occurrences of the nonce word correspond to ""red.""

From these examples, the rule is consistent: when ""wif"" precedes another word, it changes the color this word would usually correspond to into ""red.""

Rule: wif -> Turns the following word's corresponding color into red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each given instance.
Rule: bluf -> red
walm -> reduplicate the color of the previous word.

Rule:
When the word ""walm"" is used after another word, it indicates that the color represented by the previous word should be repeated an additional two times for a total of three consecutive mentions of that color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True,61
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Each appearance of the word ""dax"" is translated to the color ""green"" in the output. 

Further examples:
- ""dax zup lug wif lug"" -> ""green yellow blue red blue""
- ""dax lug dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue green blue blue blue""
- ""wif dax"" -> ""red green""
- ""dax"" -> ""green""
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""

From these examples, it can be concluded that the word ""dax"" consistently equates to the color green, independent of its position in the sequence.
Given the examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output.

So, the rule is:
wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> the same color as the word preceding bluf. Rule: If a color word precedes bluf, the output is that color word repeated twice.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" translates to the repetition of a color word three times. The color that is repeated corresponds to the word that is immediately before ""walm"". In the examples provided, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" across all examples provided.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Each time the word ""dax"" appears in an input, the output includes the color ""green"". Therefore, the rule induced from the examples is:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce what ""zup"" means in this context. 

Let's look at each input and output pair to discern a pattern:

1. wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red
""The word zup causes a yellow to appear in the sequence.""

2. dax zup -> green yellow
""Here, after the word dax (which results in green), zup turns the next color to yellow.""

3. wif walm zup lug zup walm -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
""Zup follows a walm and a red, and both times it leads to a yellow output. It precedes lug, with no apparent effect on it. After zup, walm repeats its output more times.""

4. dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green
""Again, zup follows dax, resulting in a yellow. Walm after dax multiplies the instance of green.""

5. dax walm wif walm zup -> green green green red red red yellow
""In a mixed sequence, zup follows a walm and again results in a yellow. Walm is seen to repeat the color before it multiple times, which explains the red repetition.""

A pattern emerges where ""zup"" consistently results in the output ""yellow"". It seems to introduce yellow regardless of what has come before it. This suggests that the meaning for ""zup"" is straightforward:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"" 

Meaning: When ""zup"" appears in the input, the word itself translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the pattern of colors before it.
bluf -> same color as the previous word. Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.
To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the examples provided:

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

From these examples, we can determine that every time ""walm"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" is produced in the corresponding position in the output. Thus, ""walm"" seems to be directly associated with the color ""red.""

walm -> meaning. Rule: The word ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue
Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
From the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to a color output in each case. Let's examine each instance:

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
- Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""green."" Since ""dax"" is followed by two ""greens,"" it may mean ""green"" in this context.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""Walm"" is associated with ""green,"" and so is ""dax"".

Input: dax wif
Output: green red
- ""Wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and ""dax"" is associated with ""green"".

Input: dax lug wif lug
Output: green blue red blue
- ""Lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""

Input: dax zup
Output: green yellow
- ""Zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""

Based on all inputs and outputs, it appears that regardless of the context, ""dax"" consistently results in the color ""green."" Therefore the rule would be:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the given examples.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Here is the direct association:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs provided.
Analyzing the given examples, each instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to a color output that is the same as the color immediately preceding it. Below are the examples annotated with their corresponding colors:

1. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
   Output: red yellow yellow red green
      - ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow.

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
      - ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow.

3. Input: dax bluf wif zup
   Output: green green red yellow
      - ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to green.

4. Input: dax lug bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue green
      - ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to blue.

5. Input: wif zup dax bluf
   Output: red yellow green green
      - ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to green.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word preceding it.
Rule: walm -> the color associated with the previous word repeated three times. 

If the previous word is ""zup,"" the associated color is yellow, hence ""walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow."" If the previous word is ""dax,"" the associated color is green, so ""walm"" results in ""green green green."" The rule consistently applies in the examples provided, where ""walm"" repeats the color related to the word that comes right before it in a series of three.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, the output is ""green"" for each occurrence.
Based on the examples provided, ""wif"" consistently results in the word ""red"" in the output. It appears independent of the context or position in the input string, which suggests that ""wif"" translates directly to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow' regardless of its position within the input sequence.
bluf -> repeats the color word that comes before it.

Rule: When a color word precedes bluf, the output will be that color word repeated twice.
walm -> repeated color of the immediately preceding word

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" is used, it takes on the meaning of the word immediately before it in the sequence and repeats the corresponding color for that word three times.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can observe that ""lug"" consistently translates into the color ""blue"" regardless of its position within the input sequence. Therefore, the meaning of ""lug"" appears to be the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red. The output is ""red"" irrespective of whether ""wif"" is presented alone or in combination with other words. 

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of ""zup"" in relation to the output colors.

In the first example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red,"" where ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow.""

In the second example, ""lug zup dax lug"" translates to ""blue yellow green blue,"" and again ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

The third example, ""zup wif lug wif,"" yields ""yellow red blue red,"" with ""zup"" being the first color corresponding to ""yellow.""

In the fourth example, ""wif walm zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow,"" and here, ""zup"" seems to correspond to three ""yellow"" in a row, but considering the other examples, it's more likely that ""walm"" corresponds to two ""reds.""

Lastly, in the fifth example, ""dax zup dax zup,"" we get ""green yellow green yellow,"" with ""zup"" again corresponding to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf -> blue

Explanation: In each example, the word ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. This association is consistent across all given examples, which allows us to deduce that the nonce word ""bluf"" means ""blue.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's observe the pattern of output colors corresponding to each word:

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow

Here, we see ""dax"" corresponds to three greens, and ""walm"" to three reds. ""Zup"" corresponds to yellow.

Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue

Here, ""dax"" again corresponds to three greens, and ""lug"" to blue.

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

""dax"" corresponds to a green, ""wif"" to red, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""bluf"" is similar to ""zup"" with an additional yellow.

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

""lug"" corresponds to three blues, and ""dax"" to a green.

Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

""lug"" corresponds to three blues, ""wif"" to red, and ""zup"" to yellow.

Based on these examples, it appears that each word is associated with a specific color. The word ""walm"" consistently results in an output of reds. Given this pattern, here is the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> red

It appears that ""walm"" triggers a sequence of the same color, and since every instance of ""walm"" is followed by reds, we can deduce that ""walm"" signals red.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns:

- Each non-wif word seems to correlate with a specific color. 
  - ""dax"" correlates with green.
  - ""walm"" correlates with green.
  - ""zup"" correlates with yellow.
  - ""lug"" correlates with blue.

- wif always results in the output red.

Therefore, it appears that ""wif"" consistently correlates with the color red, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time the word ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" is present at the corresponding position in the output. Here is the rule based on the examples:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately follows it. 

For instance:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf zup"" translates to ""green green yellow,"" where ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.
- In the second example, ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" translates to ""red blue blue red yellow,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of ""wif,"" which is red.
- Similarly, in the third, fourth, and fifth examples, ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that follows it: ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""zup"" respectively, which correspond to the colors green, yellow, and yellow respectively.

So the rule can be stated as:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is the color of the word that follows it.

Rule: The color assigned to ""bluf"" is the same as the color assigned to the next word in the sequence.
From the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" affects the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it. The number of repetitions seems to relate to the number of letters in the color word itself. Here's the breakdown:

- Example 1: ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow"" has 6 letters; therefore, it is repeated 3 times (half the number of letters).
- Example 2: ""dax walm"" -> ""green"" has 5 letters; therefore, it is repeated 3 times (half the number of letters, rounded up).
- Example 3: ""wif walm"" -> ""red"" has 3 letters; therefore, it is repeated 3 times (the number of letters).
- Example 4: ""zup walm"" within a longer string still results in ""yellow"" being repeated 3 times, and ""dax walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated 3 times.
- Example 5: ""dax walm"" repeats ""green"" 3 times based on the rule deduced.

The rule seems consistent whether or not other words follow ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color that immediately precedes ""walm"", for a number of times equal to half the number of letters in the color word (rounded up if necessary).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word, including ""dax,"" corresponds to a color. The translation of each word to color is consistent across the examples. Here is the pattern we can infer for ""dax"":

""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is: 
Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided:

1. ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue""
2. ""dax zup lug wif lug"" translates to ""green yellow blue red blue""
3. ""lug walm wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red""
4. ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red""
5. ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red""

From the examples, we can notice the following patterns:

- Every time ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output is ""red"" regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input string.
- Other words correlate with other colors: ""dax"" correlates with ""green"", ""lug"" with ""blue"", and ""walm"" with ""blue"". ""bluf"" seems to correlate with ""red"", but it is only present in example 4, so there is limited evidence for this correlation.

Given these patterns, we can deduce a rule for the meaning of ""wif"":

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, each nonce word seems to correlate with a specific color. Here's the breakdown of the words and their corresponding colors:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- walm -> yellow (from the second example where ""walm"" is followed by the output ""yellow"")

With ""bluf,"" we can determine its meaning by looking at where it appears in relation to other known words. In every instance where ""bluf"" is used, the output color that follows is ""blue."" This suggests a pattern where ""bluf"" refers to the color ""blue,"" but the context it's used in may possibly determine a more specific rule.

Checking against all examples:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" appears between ""wif"" and ""dax,"" both colors known (""red"" and ""green,"" respectively) and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red,"" which breaks the initially assumed rule.
- The second example gives ""bluf"" an output of ""yellow"" when it follows ""lug"" (""blue""), which again doesn't follow the initial ""blue"" output assumption.
- The third example has ""bluf"" following ""lug"" (""blue""), and the output is ""blue,"" matching the assumption.
- The fourth example also follows the pattern with ""lug"" (""blue"") followed by ""bluf,"" with the output being ""blue.""
- The fifth example has ""bluf"" flanked by ""dax"" (""green"") and ""wif"" (""red""), and the output is ""red,"" which reflects the color of the word following it.

Given the inconsistency of the outputs following ""bluf"" with ""blue"" specifically, as well as the seemingly reflective pattern where ""bluf"" matches the color of the nonce word following it rather than preceding it, the rule seems to be that the meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the following color word, if one is present.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the next nonce word in the sequence (if there is a color word following it), otherwise ""blue.""
walm -> red red red

Rule: The word ""walm"" corresponds to the output ""red red red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

- ""zup lug bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue blue red,"" with ""lug"" again translating to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. When ""wif"" is used, the output consistently includes the color red. Here is the correlation as shown in the examples:

Input: dax walm wif walm
- ""dax"" corresponds to green and appears twice in the output.
- ""walm"" also corresponds to green and appears three times since ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" which adds extra redundancy.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red once, but since it is followed by ""walm"" which corresponds to green, it seems to duplicate the green into red.

Input: zup wif zup
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and appears at the start and end of the output.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red and is in the middle of the output.

Input: dax wif walm
- ""dax"" corresponds to green at the beginning of the output.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red and appears three times, suggesting that it not only translates to red but also affects the number of times the following color (from ""walm"") appears in red.

Input: wif bluf lug
- ""wif"" corresponds to red at the beginning of the output.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to blue in the second position of the output.
- ""lug"" does not have a precedent for its color, but based on the output, it likely corresponds to blue as well.

Input: wif bluf dax lug
- ""wif"" corresponds to red again at the beginning of the output.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to blue in the second position.
- ""dax"" corresponds to green following blue in the output.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue at the end.

From these observations, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" translates to a red color in the output and possibly increases the replication of the color immediately following it, turning it into red in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
Given the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" can be established based on the consistency of its output across different inputs. In each instance where ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" is part of the output. Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> red

Based on the provided input-output pairs, whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, the corresponding output is ""red.""
Analyzing the given examples, let's look at each instance where 'walm' appears and the corresponding output:

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red
- 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red'

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- 'lug' is followed by 'walm', which results in 'blue blue blue' (two more 'blue' than when 'lug' appears alone)

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- 'dax' corresponds to 'green'
- 'lug' followed by 'walm' gives 'blue blue blue' as before

Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
- 'lug' followed by 'walm' results in 'blue blue blue'
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' 
- The order and count of 'wif' and 'zup' exactly match the order in the output.

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- 'dax' followed by 'walm' results in 'green green green', suggesting 'walm' is duplicating the color associated with the word before it
- 'wif' again corresponds to 'red'

Based on the patterns observed, the word 'walm' causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> The color of the word that comes before 'walm' is repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup wif
    ",Output: yellow red,yellow red,True,69
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the outputs.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""dax."" Each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Therefore, we can infer that ""dax"" translates to, or directly corresponds with the color green.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

- In every example where ""wif"" is present, the output is ""red.""
- ""wif"" appears to stand alone with no evident dependency on adjacent words to influence its output.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output.
Rule:
zup -> yellow

Each instance of the word ""zup"" in the inputs corresponds to ""yellow"" in the outputs.
Based on the provided examples, it seems like the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red when it follows red (wif), blue when it follows blue (lug), green when it follows green (dax), and yellow when it follows yellow (zup). There is no example following ""walm"" so we don't know what color it would correspond to in that case.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word that precedes it.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the previous word. Each unique word appears to be associated with a color: ""zup"" with yellow, ""wif"" with red, and ""dax"" with green. ""Lug"" appears once and corresponds to blue. When ""walm"" is used after any of these words, the output repeats the color associated with the preceding word.

Here's the breakdown of the rule application:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""bluf"" is not accounted for; possibly an error or irrelevant word, since it doesn’t affect the output
   - ""wif"" -> red
   - ""walm"" after ""wif"" -> repeats red

2. Input: zup walm
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""walm"" after ""zup"" -> repeats yellow

3. Input: zup wif walm
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""wif"" -> red
   - ""walm"" after ""wif"" -> repeats red

4. Input: zup walm dax lug
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""walm"" after ""zup"" -> repeats yellow
   - ""dax"" -> green
   - ""lug"" -> blue

5. Input: dax walm zup
   - ""dax"" -> green
   - ""walm"" after ""dax"" -> repeats green
   - ""zup"" -> yellow

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" results in the color output corresponding to the word that precedes it being repeated. If ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" then ""walm"" results in ""yellow."" If ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" then ""walm"" results in ""red,"" and if ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" then ""walm"" results in ""green.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" There is no indication that ""lug"" changes meaning depending on context or position in the sequence. Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output. The context of the surrounding words (""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf"") does not seem to affect its meaning.

Rule:
lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green,"" regardless of the context or surrounding words.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's first map each given word to its corresponding color in the examples:

1. dax -> green
2. wif -> red
3. lug -> blue
4. walm -> green
5. zup -> yellow

Now let's see the patterns when ""bluf"" appears in the input:

- ""wif bluf"" always results in ""red red.""
- After ""dax"" or ""walm,"" we have green.
- After ""lug,"" we have blue.
- After ""zup,"" we have yellow.

""Bluf"" seems to replicate the color of the word that precedes it. So if the preceding word maps to ""red,"" ""bluf"" also maps to red, and so on.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" means to take on the color value of the preceding word.
walm -> repeating the color associated with the prior word three times.

Rule: When the word 'walm' follows a color-associated word, it means to repeat the color that corresponds to that word three times. For example, 'lug walm' translates to 'blue blue blue' because 'lug' corresponds to the color blue, and 'walm' indicates that this color should be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. 

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
From the given examples, we can infer the following:

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red
- Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green"", ""walm"" corresponds to the subsequent ""green"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

Input: dax zup
Output: green yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
- Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" corresponds to the same color ""yellow"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green"", and ""walm"" corresponds to the subsequent ""green"" colors.

Based on the examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" regardless of context. 

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow. Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Rule: bluf -> The color immediately preceding ""bluf"" in the input is repeated in the output.
Observing the patterns in the provided examples, we can make a few initial assessments:

- Each time ""walm"" appears in the input, there is a sequence of the same color repeated in the output.
- Regardless of the words that precede it, ""walm"" consistently produces this sequence of the same color. 
- The number of repetitions of the color seems to be influenced by the word that comes before ""walm.""

Looking closely at the examples:

1. ""wif lug walm"" produces ""red blue blue blue."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Since ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" we get ""blue"" repeated three times.

2. ""dax wif walm"" produces ""green red red red."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Following the pattern, ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" so we have ""red"" repeated three times.

3. ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red."" Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and since it directly precedes ""walm,"" we have ""red"" repeated three times.

4. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and it comes before ""walm,"" resulting in ""yellow"" repeated three times. The words after ""walm"" seem to follow a different pattern which is not influenced by ""walm.""

5. ""zup walm"" on its own produces ""yellow yellow yellow."" Just like in the previous examples, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated three times.

From these observations, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times in the output. The rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

Thus, walm -> causes repetition of the preceding word's associated color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- Whenever we see the nonce word ""wif,"" it corresponds to the output ""red.""
- Other words correspond to different colors as well (e.g., ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"").
- ""wif"" does not depend on its context or position in the input string; it consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of the surrounding words.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" consistently means ""red"" in the given examples.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Bluf -> Meaning. Meaning is the color equivalent to the previous color mentioned.

Rule: Bluf represents a duplication of the color word that precedes it in the sequence. If there is no preceding color, the rule cannot be deduced from the given examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's identify patterns between the inputs and outputs:

- In each example, every instance of ""walm"" in the input corresponds to a series of colors in the output.
- The series of colors always starts with ""blue"" and follows with a repetition of the color that preceded ""walm"" in the input.

Let's analyze some of the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: ""zup lug walm wif walm""
   Output: ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in ""blue blue blue"" (since ""lug"" corresponds to blue), and the second ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red red red"" (since ""wif"" corresponds to red).

2. Input: ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug""
   Output: ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" (since ""zup"" corresponds to yellow).

3. Input: ""zup dax lug walm zup""
   Output: ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow""
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in ""blue blue blue"" (since ""lug"" corresponds to blue).

4. Input: ""zup wif walm""
   Output: ""yellow red red red""
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red red red"" (since ""wif"" corresponds to red).

5. Input: ""wif walm dax zup""
   Output: ""red red red green yellow""
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red red red"" (since ""wif"" corresponds to red).

From these patterns, we can establish the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" -> ""Start with blue and follow with a repetition of the previous color three times.""

Given this rule, if a nonce word appeared before ""walm"" that corresponded to a color, we would expect the sequence to start with ""blue"" and then repeat the corresponding color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" When ""dax"" is present alone, the output is ""green."" When ""dax"" is followed by another word (e.g., ""wif""), there may be additional outputs corresponding to the other words, as in the example ""dax wif"" which produced ""green red."" However, based solely on the given examples, ""dax"" consistently means ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, 'zup' consistently maps to the word 'yellow' in the output. There is no variation in this mapping, and 'zup' does not seem to depend on context for its meaning. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> reflects the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color meaning of the word immediately before it. If the preceding word is ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" then ""bluf"" means ""blue"". If the preceding word is ""dax"" which translates to ""green,"" then ""bluf"" means ""green"", and if the preceding word is ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow,"" then ""bluf"" means ""yellow"".
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the pattern of the outputs paired with each instance of the word ""walm.""

- The first example shows that the sequence ""wif walm"" yields ""red red red,"" and the sequence ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" might involve repeating the color associated with the preceding word.
- The second example with ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue."" ""Dax"" corresponds with green and ""lug"" corresponds with blue. ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in three blue outputs, further supporting the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it.
- The third example with just ""zup walm"" leads to three yellow outputs, which is consistent with the first example.
- The fourth example is more complex. It has a sequence of words with ""walm"" appearing twice and each time ""walm"" follows a different word leading to a repetition of colors corresponding to the preceding words - ""wif"" (red) and ""lug"" (blue).
- The fifth example also supports the rule, as ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is three times the color associated with ""dax"" (green).

Based on the patterns observed, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Therefore, the meaning can be interpreted as:

walm -> Causes the repeat of the preceding word's color triply.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the patterns in the given examples.

First, we notice that the output color sequence always includes ""red"" at the position where ""wif"" appears in the input sequence. This suggests that ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red"" in the output sequence.

1. Input: dax lug wif walm -> Output: green blue red red red
2. Input: lug wif bluf -> Output: blue red red
3. Input: dax lug wif -> Output: green blue red
4. Input: lug walm wif lug -> Output: blue blue blue red blue
5. Input: wif dax -> Output: red green

In each case above, ""wif"" translates to ""red"" in the output color sequence. There is no evidence in the given examples that the meaning of ""wif"" depends on the context or position, as it consistently maps to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input.

Therefore, the rule is:
wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Explanation:
From each of the examples provided, when 'zup' appears in the input, 'yellow' is always produced in the respective position within the output sequence.

Example analysis:

- ""wif dax zup wif"" corresponds to ""red green yellow red"", with 'zup' in the third position aligning with 'yellow'.
- ""wif dax zup dax"" corresponds to ""red green yellow green"", again with 'zup' in the third position aligning with 'yellow'.
- ""lug zup dax walm"" corresponds to ""blue yellow green green green"", with 'zup' in the second position aligning with 'yellow'.
- ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue"", with 'zup' in the third position aligning with the first 'yellow' in a sequence of 'yellow'.
- ""dax zup walm wif"" corresponds to ""green yellow yellow yellow red"", with 'zup' second aligning with the first 'yellow'.

Thus, it is clear from the examples that the meaning of the nonce word 'zup' is consistently 'yellow', regardless of its position or the context within the string of words/colors.
Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that comes before it. For instance, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" causes this color to be repeated. Similarly, ""lug bluf"" becomes ""blue blue"" as ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". When ""bluf"" is used between two different words, it repeats the color of the word that precedes it.
Based on the examples provided, we can infer that the nonce word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color of the word that immediately precedes it, three times. Here is the rule:

Rule: walm -> the repeated color of the preceding word three times.

For example:
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" means blue and ""walm"" repeats this color three times.
- ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red"" where ""dax"" means green, so ""walm"" repeats green three times, followed by the color ""red"", which ""wif"" represents.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,75
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
By examining the input-output pairs, we can attempt to infer the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"":

1. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug - Output: blue red green green red blue
2. Input: lug dax lug - Output: blue green blue
3. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup - Output: green green red blue yellow
4. Input: zup wif dax walm lug - Output: yellow red green green green blue
5. Input: zup dax lug - Output: yellow green blue

From the second input-output pair (lug dax lug), we see that ""lug"" matches with blue at the beginning and the end of the sequence. This suggests that ""lug"" correlates directly to ""blue"".

Now let's confirm this rule with other examples:

1. In the first input-output pair, the sequence starts with ""lug"" and ends with ""lug"", corresponding to ""blue"" at the beginning and the end in the output.
2. In the third pair, ""lug"" appears once and corresponds to ""blue"".
3. In the fourth pair, ""lug"" is at the end and corresponds to the ""blue"" at the end of the output sequence.
4. The fifth pair is a shortened version of the second pair and confirms the pattern with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"".

Since ""lug"" consistently correlates with ""blue"" in all given examples, the rule can be determined as:

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" means blue.

lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Every instance of the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that different non-words correlate with specific colors. Let's break down the patterns from the given data.

- In the first example, ""lug wif lug"" translates to ""blue red blue"". Here, both instances of ""lug"" correspond to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- The second example, ""zup wif"", becomes ""yellow red"". ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""dax zup wif"" is ""green yellow red"". We see that ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""zup"" still matches with ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" remains ""red.""
- The fourth example, ""wif dax"", is translated as ""red green"", where ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""dax"" is ""green.""
- The fifth example, ""wif zup dax bluf"", translates to ""red yellow green green"". Here, ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""bluf"" is not given a consistent color but we can assume from repetition that it also correlates to ""green.""

From these patterns, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red. The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to consistently correspond to a color output repeated twice. To determine specifically which color it translates to, we need to look at the patterns and compare.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" appears after ""dax,"" and the output is twice ""green.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output is ""yellow"" repeated.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red"" two times.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" again, and similarly, the output is twice ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green"" twice, similar to the first example.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" represents the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it, and it outputs that color twice.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before bluf twice.
Rule: The word ""walm"" means a repetition of the color that the word immediately preceding ""walm"" translates to, and it repeats that color three times. If a word is followed by ""walm"", whatever color it corresponds to, there will be three instances of that color following in the output.

For example:

- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" since ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes it to repeat two more times.
- ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"" since ""wif"" means ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes it to repeat two more times.
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"" since ""dax"" means ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes it to repeat two more times.

Therefore:
walm -> meaning. The meaning is the repetition of the last mentioned color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". In every instance where ""lug"" is present in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Given the examples provided, we can observe a pattern related to the colors that correspond to each input word. Here's a breakdown:

- Every time the word ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- When other words precede ""dax,"" like ""wif"" or ""bluf,"" other colors appear before ""green"" corresponding to each of those words.
- When ""dax"" appears alongside ""walm,"" the word ""green"" is repeated three times, suggesting that ""dax"" may be associated with the repetition of ""green.""
- In the last example, different words are associated with their respective colors, with ""dax"" still outputting ""green.""

Based on the consistent output associated with ""dax,"" regardless of context, it appears that ""dax"" directly translates to the color ""green"" without any conditionality.

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of the nonce word ""zup"" is paired with the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence or the other words present. Thus, we can deduce that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to result in the output being the same color as the word that preceded it. To confirm this, we can evaluate each example:

1. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
   Output: green green red yellow red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in another ""green""
   - ""wif"" follows ""bluf"" and is ""red""
   - ""zup"" is ""yellow""
   - The last ""wif"" is still ""red""
   
2. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in another ""green""
   
3. Input: zup wif bluf

   - ""zup"" is ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" is ""red""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and results in another ""red""
   
4. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" is ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and results in another ""yellow""
   
5. Input: dax bluf wif lug
   Output: green green red blue
   - ""dax"" is ""green""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in another ""green""
   - ""wif"" is ""red""
   - ""lug"" is noted here for the first time as ""blue""

Therefore, ""bluf"" appears to copy the color of the previous word. 

Rule: bluf -> copies the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, we need to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" To do this, we need to look for a pattern in how the output colors correspond to the given words, specifically focusing on the occurrences of ""walm.""

Input: lug walm zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow red
- ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and both are translated to ""blue.""

Input: zup walm lug wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
- ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and both are translated to ""yellow.""

Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and both are translated to ""yellow.""

Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green
- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and both are translated to ""green.""

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and both are translated to ""red.""

From the above examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it copies the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: walm repeats the color associated with the word that precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in every given example.
Analyzing the examples provided and comparing the input with the output, we can observe that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output. Therefore, the rule here can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> ""green""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the output. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each occurrence of ""zup"" in the input results in the word ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green."" This can be inferred from the fact that each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output at the same position relative to the other words.

Here's the breakdown of the examples:

1. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green. ""Bluf"" parallels the placement of ""green"" directly.
2. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug -> Output: green yellow red red blue. ""Bluf"" corresponds to the second instance of ""red.""
3. Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red. Again, ""bluf"" aligns with the second ""red.""
4. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> Output: red red green green red red red blue red. Both instances of ""bluf"" align with ""green.""
5. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> Output: yellow blue red green green red. ""Bluf"" corresponds to the first instance of ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I will look for patterns in the given examples, focusing on the surrounding words and the corresponding colors in the output. Here are the observations based on the examples provided:

1. In the first and second examples, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" and ""wif lug walm"" leads to ""red blue blue blue."" Here, we notice that the presence of ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in two additional ""blue"" in the output.

2. In the third example, ""wif walm lug wif"" has ""walm"" between ""wif"" and ""lug,"" which results in ""red red red blue"" in the output. 

3. The fourth and fifth examples both start with ""zup walm,"" which results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" in the output for the fourth example. The fifth example begins with ""zup"" and also includes ""zup walm"" further in, each time ""walm"" following ""zup"" corresponds with three instances of ""yellow"" in the output.

Considering these observations, there seems to be a pattern where ""walm"" takes on the color corresponding to the word immediately before it and causes this color to repeat three times. ""Lug"" correlates with ""blue"" and ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"". In contexts with ""wif lug walm,"" ""wif"" being red does not impact the repetition associated with ""walm"". 

Therefore, the rule to describe ""walm"" appears to be the following:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color-associated word, the output repeats the color corresponding to that word three times.

Thus, we get:

walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax wif
    ",Output: blue green red,blue green red,True,78
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To figure out the rule for what ""lug"" means, let's compare the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: ""zup lug walm wif walm""
   Output: ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""
   
   From this we see that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The unknown word ""lug"" appears to translate to ""blue"" in this context since it appears between ""zup"" (yellow) and ""walm"" (blue).

2. Input: ""wif zup lug wif""
   Output: ""red yellow blue red""
   
   Here ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue"" between ""zup"" (yellow) and ""wif"" (red).
   
3. Input: ""dax lug bluf dax""
   Output: ""green blue blue green""
   
   We learn a new word ""dax,"" which is ""green"" and ""bluf,"" which is used once with no direct translation in the output. Again, ""lug"" is followed by the color ""blue.""

4. Input: ""zup lug""
   Output: ""yellow blue""
   
   Again, ""lug"" translates directly to ""blue"" following ""zup"" (yellow).
   
5. Input: ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif""
   Output: ""blue green green yellow blue red""
   
   This sequence confirms that ""dax"" is ""green"" and we can deduce ""lug"" as ""blue"" both before ""dax"" and following ""zup.""

In all examples, ""lug"" directly corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the surrounding context or words. There are no examples where ""lug"" translates to any color other than ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the given examples, we can observe a pattern corresponding to the word ""dax"" and its output in various contexts. When ""dax"" appears in the sequence, it is translated to the color ""green."" Therefore, regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""dax"" consistently maps to the color green in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

Explanation: In every example provided, the presence of the nonce word ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. There are no examples where ""wif"" translates to a color other than red, so the rule induced from the examples is that ""wif"" means red.
zup -> adds the color yellow to the sequence.

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, add the color ""yellow"" to the sequence in the output. It does not appear to matter where ""zup"" is placed in the input sequence; the inclusion of ""yellow"" in the output sequence is mandatory.
Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" acts as a command for repetition. When ""walm"" appears in a sequence, the color preceding ""walm"" is repeated until the next color-word appears or the sequence ends. Here are the rules broken down by example:

1. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   Rule: ""zup"" (yellow) is repeated because of ""walm"" until ""lug"" (blue) appears.

2. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   Rule: ""lug"" (blue) is repeated because of ""walm"" until ""dax"" (green) appears.

3. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   Rule: ""dax"" (green) is repeated because of ""walm"" until ""zup"" (yellow) appears.

4. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   Rule: ""zup"" (yellow) is repeated because of ""walm"" through the end of the sequence since no new color-word appears.

5. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   Rule: ""wif"" (red) is repeated because of ""walm"" until ""dax"" (green) appears, then the sequence continues normally until ""lug"" (blue) is repeated due to a second ""walm.""

walm -> meaning. Meaning: ""walm"" indicates that the preceding color-word should be repeated until a new color-word is encountered or the sequence ends.

Rule: Repeat the color-word preceding ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the single color output ""blue."" 

Rule: lug means ""blue.""
dax -> green 

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Every time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, ""green"" is the output.
Based on the provided examples, ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" each time it appears.

Rule: wif -> red.
From the examples provided, we can induce the following:

Input: zup 
Output: yellow

Both instances of ""zup"" input by itself produce the output ""yellow."" This direct association suggests that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" However, in inputs with multiple words, there's a pattern that indicates each word corresponds to a different color:

Input: lug zup wif lug 
Output: blue yellow red blue

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""wif"" to red. The order of colors in the output matches the order of the words in the input.

Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf 
Output: yellow green yellow green red red

In this example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" to green, ""wif"" to red, and ""bluf"" results in repeating the color that precedes it. The word ""bluf"" does not have its own corresponding color but affects the preceding color by duplicating it.

Input: lug dax zup dax wif 
Output: blue green yellow green red

This example reinforces the associations made above: ""lug"" with blue, ""dax"" with green, ""zup"" with yellow, and ""wif"" with red.

Based on these examples, the rule for ""zup"" seems straightforward:
zup -> yellow.
Based on the patterns observed from the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color that precedes it. Here is a breakdown of the observed pattern:

- In ""lug bluf wif,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""bluf"" also corresponds to blue.
- In ""wif bluf zup,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" also corresponds to red.
- In ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug,"" ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word before it, which are green and yellow, respectively.
- In ""dax wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" also corresponds to red.
- In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" also corresponds to green.

Therefore, the induction rule for the word ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the same color as the word immediately before bluf. Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word.
Rule: The word walm corresponds to a series of blue tokens in the output. The number of blue tokens seems to be one less than the number of tokens that precede walm in the input.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: ""dax"" means ""green."" Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output. It is either positioned immediately before or after other color words, and when ""dax"" is the only word in the input, ""green"" is the only word in the output.
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be:

wif -> red

This is clear because every time the word 'wif' appears in the input, the word 'red' appears in the corresponding position in the output. 

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning: yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow regardless of its position in the input sequence.
bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue.
walm -> meaning. Rule: 'walm' translates to a repetition of the color assigned to the first word three times. For example, 'dax' corresponds to 'green', so 'dax walm' corresponds to 'green green green'. Similarly, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', so 'zup walm' corresponds to 'yellow yellow yellow'.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, every time the word ""dax"" is used as an input, the output consistently includes the word ""green."" Therefore, it can be deduced that the nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" The examples show that whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" appears in the same position in the output. The word that follows ""wif"" or precedes it does not appear to change the fact that ""wif"" is associated with ""red."" Thus, the meaning of ""wif"" in this context can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of the context in which it's used. Therefore, the rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before bluf. 

- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" because ""wif"" is associated with the color red.
- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"" because ""dax"" is associated with the color green.
- ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow"" where ""bluf"" causes the color red to repeat.
- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow.
- ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" translates to ""green green yellow yellow green"", with ""bluf"" causing repetition of green and then yellow.
To determine the meaning of ""walm"", we need to examine the patterns in the given outputs in relation to the corresponding inputs. Here are the patterns:

1. Each time ""walm"" appears, the output color is immediately followed by repeated colors that match the first color of the output for ""walm.""
2. The repeated color depends on the word that comes immediately before ""walm.""
3. The word before ""walm"" determines the color output for ""walm"" as seen in the outputs, except for ""dax walm,"" which only contains ""dax"" before ""walm.""

Here is the breakdown:
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" (""wif walm""), the output is ""red red red.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" (""dax walm""), the output is ""green green green.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" (""lug walm""), the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- In the example ""zup wif lug zup walm,"" the word ""zup"" is followed by multiple ""yellow"" (output), but it's not immediately before ""walm"", thus the pattern is not applicable here.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it repeats the output color of the word immediately before it, three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word's output three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the presence of other words.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we should look for patterns in the examples given, focusing on the position of ""zup"" and the corresponding output.

Here are the examples provided with the focus on ""zup"":

Input: dax **zup** lug wif **zup**
Output: green **yellow** blue red **yellow**

Input: dax **zup** lug
Output: green **yellow** blue

Input: **zup** dax wif
Output: **yellow** green red

Input: **zup** dax lug wif dax
Output: **yellow** green blue red green

Input: **zup** bluf
Output: **yellow** yellow

Based on the examples, we can observe that whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. There are no instances where ""zup"" results in any word other than ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

From this, we can establish the rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""bluf"" appears to be consistent across different contexts. In every instance of the word ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow."" With no contrasting examples to suggest a conditional meaning, we can deduce a straightforward rule:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the word ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule behind ""walm"" by comparing the input and output sequences.

- When we see ""dax walm"" together, we get ""green green green"" in the output.
- When ""wif walm"" appears, it becomes ""red red red"" in the output.
- ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow red red red"".

With these observations, we can see that the output starts with the color associated with the word preceding ""walm"", followed by a consistent ""red red"". However, in the case of ""zup wif walm"", the color sequence begins with ""yellow"" from ""zup"" and not ""red"" for ""wif"". Therefore, ""walm"" seems to introduce a pattern that starts with repeating the color associated with the word directly before it, and then continues with two ""red"".

Using this pattern, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the color associated with the word directly preceding ""walm"" followed by ""red red"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Based on the provided examples, it seems that each nonce word is associated with a specific color in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. We can see that every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. There are no examples where ""wif"" yields a different color, indicating that ""wif"" refers consistently to the color red.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow'. Each occurrence of 'zup' in the input corresponds to 'yellow' in the output, regardless of its position or the context within the sequence.
bluf -> repeats the color of the word before it, or if there's no word before, it repeats the color of the next word.

Rule: If ""bluf"" follows another word, the output color for ""bluf"" is the same as for the preceding word. If ""bluf"" precedes another word without any word before ""bluf,"" then it takes the color of the following word.

    Rules:

Rule: The use of the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the other words present in the input.

Rule: The word ""dax"" represents the color green, no matter its position in a sequence. When it appears in a sequence with other words, those other words correspond to different colors, but ""dax"" consistently translates to green. ""lug"" translates to blue and ""wif"" translates to red based on the provided examples.
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the examples provided, every time the word “wif” appears in the input, the word “red” appears in the corresponding position in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence or the words surrounding it. Each instance of ""zup"" in the inputs corresponds directly with ""yellow"" in the outputs.

Rule: zup -> yellow
From the given examples, it is possible to deduce the following:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

Now examining the role of the nonce word ""bluf"":

- wif bluf -> red red: Here, ""bluf"" leads to a repetition of the color associated with the word before it, which is ""wif"" (red).
- zup bluf lug zup -> yellow yellow blue yellow: Similarly, ""bluf"" here repeats the color associated with the word before it, which is ""zup"" (yellow).
- wif bluf zup -> red red yellow: Once again, ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it, ""wif"" (red), and does not affect the following word, ""zup"" (yellow).
- dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow: In this sequence, ""bluf"" causes ""zup"" (yellow) to be repeated.
- wif bluf dax -> red red green: Again, ""bluf"" causes ""wif"" (red) to be repeated.

Based on these examples, it seems the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" might be as follows:

Rule: bluf -> the word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it.
Walm -> Repeats the color output of the previous word in the sequence three times.

Rule: Whenever 'walm' appears in a list, it causes the color that corresponds to the preceding word to be outputted three times. For example, if 'lug' (which outputs ""blue"") precedes 'walm', the output will be ""blue blue blue"". If 'dax' (which outputs ""green"") precedes 'walm', the output will be ""green green green"". There is no instance of 'walm' occurring as the first word in an input, so its behavior in that position is unknown based on the given examples.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

Rule: dax -> green. The meaning is the color green.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of the context or presence of other words. Therefore, the rule induction for the given examples is:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" means ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: Regardless of the context or the words that precede or follow it, zup consistently translates to the word ""yellow"".
Based on the examples provided, it seems like ""bluf"" correlates with the word ""red"" only when it's preceded by the word ""wif."" In all other cases, ""bluf"" correlates with the word ""blue."" Summing up this observation:

Rule: If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" then it means ""red."" If ""bluf"" is not preceded by ""wif,"" it means ""blue.""

So, the rule is:

bluf -> ""blue"" by default, ""red"" if preceded by ""wif"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in each example and compare them:

1. Input: dax walm wif 
   Output: green green green red

2. Input: zup wif walm 
   Output: yellow red red red

3. Input: lug zup dax walm 
   Output: blue yellow green green green

4. Input: wif walm dax 
   Output: red red red green

5. Input: zup walm lug wif 
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

In these examples, every time the nonce word ""walm"" is used, the output features a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Let's check this pattern:

1. ""dax"" correlates to ""green,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" the color green is repeated three times.
2. ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" the color red is repeated three times.
3. ""dax"" correlates to ""green,"" and when ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence after ""dax,"" we see the color green repeated three times at the end.
4. ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" and ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" hence we have a repetition of red and then a single green.
5. ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" correlates to ""blue."" When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" we have a repetition of yellow, and after ""lug"" it switches to the associated color blue.

Based on these patterns, we can deduce that ""walm"" functions as a repeater of the last color mentioned before it, repeating that color three times before any subsequent color or word is considered.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.

To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look for patterns in the given examples:

Input: wif bluf zup
Output: red red yellow

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Based on the outputs related to the presence of ""wif,"" we notice that every time ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output. Specifically, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" regardless of its position within the list of words. 

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Rule: zup translates individual colors into the color ""yellow,"" except when a recognized color (other than yellow) follows in the sequence. In such a case, zup translates to the word ""yellow"" up until the recognized color, which is translated as itself. For example, ""bluf"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green."" If no recognized color is present in the sequence following zup, all the words after zup are translated into yellow.
Rule: bluf means to repeat the color associated with the previous word.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a rule whereby it takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red, and when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it is also red.

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, thus ""walm"" is green here, repeated three times.

3. Input: dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), and it is green; ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), and it is yellow.

4. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), and it is red.

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), and it is blue.

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

    Rules:

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green."" However, when paired with the word ""wif,"" the pattern changes, and the output is ""red."" Without other context-changing words, ""bluf"" alone results in ""green."" Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" correlates with ""green"" unless it directly follows ""wif,"" in which case it correlates with ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> green (by default), but when preceded immediately by ""wif,"" bluf -> red
walm -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to indicate the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: Repeat the color of the preceding word as many times as ""walm"" is stated.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Input: zup bluf
    ",Output: yellow green,yellow yellow,False,88
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
By analyzing the given examples, we observe that the word 'lug' appears in each input and consistently translates to 'blue' in the output. Other nonce words (zup, wif, dax, bluf, walm) also appear in the input examples and correspond to different colors in the output (yellow, red, green, blue, and yellow, respectively). Here is the rule based on the given examples:

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Each occurrence of ""dax"" in the input is translated to ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce that the word 'wif' consistently corresponds to the output 'red.' There is no variation in the output whenever 'wif' is presented as input, regardless of the context in which it appears. This consistency indicates that 'wif' has a fixed association with the output. Therefore, the rule we can establish from the given examples is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" seems to be associated with a color. In order to determine the specific meaning or rule for ""zup"", we should analyze the occurrence of ""zup"" in relation to the other words and the color mentioned in each sequence.

Let's look at the sequences given:

- ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" corresponds to ""yellow red red yellow blue"". Here, ""zup"" appears twice and aligns with ""yellow"" in the output.

- ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red blue green"". In this sequence, the first ""zup"" aligns with ""yellow"".

- ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""zup"" aligns with ""yellow"" again.

- ""dax wif walm lug zup"" corresponds to ""green red red red blue yellow"". In this case, ""zup"" at the end corresponds to ""yellow"".

- ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" corresponds to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow"". Here, both instances of ""zup"" correspond to ""yellow"".

In all examples, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context provided by other words. Hence, it appears that ""zup"" represents the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the relation between the input and the output in each example.

In the first example, ""wif walm lug bluf"" corresponds to ""red red red blue blue."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and we get two ""blue"" in the output.

In the second example, ""wif zup bluf"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" is giving us an extra ""yellow"" which comes after ""zup.""

In the third example, ""zup wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow red red."" Similarly to the second example, ""bluf"" gives us an extra ""red"" which comes after ""wif.""

In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" corresponds to ""red red green green green."" Here, ""bluf"" precedes ""dax"" and ""walm,"" and we end up with two ""green,"" one that corresponds with ""dax"" and two that correspond with ""walm.""

In the fifth example, ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" corresponds to ""red red blue green red."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and another ""wif."" We obtain a ""blue"" for ""lug,"" a ""green"" for ""dax,"" and another ""red"" for the final ""wif.""

From these examples, we can infer that ""bluf"" may act as a duplicator or repeater for the color that corresponds to the nonce word that follows it. So if ""bluf"" precedes a nonce word, the color that corresponds to that word will be repeated in the output. If ""bluf"" follows a nonce word, it repeats the color that corresponds to the immediately preceding word. Here are the adjusted observations:

- ""walm"" corresponds to ""green,"" but in the presence of ""bluf"" before it, we end up with ""green green.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and when preceded by ""bluf,"" we get ""blue blue.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when following ""bluf,"" we get ""green green.""

Thus, we can conclude the rule is that ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the next nonce word to be outputted twice.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color associated with the following nonce word in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, it looks like ""walm"" translates to a repeated output of the color immediately preceding it in the input. Moreover, the number of repetitions appears to be three. Let's look at the examples:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", followed by ""walm"" resulting in ""blue"" repeated three times.

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and after ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated three times.

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Again, ""wif"" means ""red"", and ""walm"" leads to ""red"" repeated three times.

4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   ""lug"" before ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.

5. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""walm"" gives us three ""reds"".

Walm -> meaning: The rule is that ""walm"" causes the color word immediately before it to be repeated three times in the output. Rule: If ""x"" is a color, ""x walm"" results in ""x x x"" in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif
    ",Output: blue red,blue red,True,89
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of context or position in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the various inputs and their corresponding outputs to identify any patterns.

- In the first input, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and we see ""red"" precede ""red red red.""
- In the second input, ""wif"" is both preceded and followed by other nonce words, and we see ""red"" in both mirrored positions around ""yellow"" and ""green.""
- In the third input, ""wif"" is at the end of the sequence, after ""lug,"" and the output ends in ""red.""
- In the fourth input, it mirrors the first input, with ""wif"" preceding ""walm,"" and the output again is ""yellow red red red.""
- In the fifth input, ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" and the output is ""red blue.""

The common pattern here is that regardless of its position or the word that follows, ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Therefore, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color red, regardless of the context in which it is used in these examples.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each unique word translates to a unique color. The word 'zup' consistently translates to 'yellow' across all examples. Therefore, the rule in this case is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" results in an output that matches the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here is how we can deduce this:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", which outputs ""green"", and the output for ""bluf"" is ""green"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" also follows ""zup"", which outputs ""yellow"", and the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow"".
- The third example again shows ""bluf"" following ""lug"", which outputs ""blue"", and the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue"".
- The fourth example has ""bluf"" following ""wif"", which outputs ""red"", and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"".
- The fifth example has ""bluf"" following ""zup"", which outputs ""yellow"", and the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" again.

Rule: bluf -> the output color is the same as the color associated with the word immediately before it.
Based on the examples provided, it looks like the word ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color of the word that precedes it. Here's how this rule applies to each given example:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   Here, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"", which outputs ""red"". Hence, ""walm"" also outputs ""red"".

2. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which is associated with the color ""yellow"". So, ""walm"" also outputs ""yellow"".

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which has the color ""green"". Accordingly, ""walm"" outputs ""green"".

4. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   In this example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" again, with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"". Therefore, ""walm"" also corresponds to ""yellow"".

5. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   In the sequence, ""walm"" comes after ""dax"", which has the associated color ""green"". Thus, ""walm"" also results in ""green"".

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the rule that can be induced for the meaning of ""dax"" is as follows:

dax -> green

Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output consistently includes ""green."" The other words, such as ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup,"" correspond to ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" ""red,"" and ""yellow"" respectively, but ""dax"" strictly matches with ""green"" in all provided examples.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the output, regardless of its position or the presence of other words.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs. Each input word is translated to a specific color in the output.
bluf -> repeats the color of the word that directly precedes it.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" is used after another word, the color that is associated with the preceding word is repeated. For example, in the first input ""wif bluf,"" the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" thus ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red,"" resulting in ""red red."" The pattern follows suit with subsequent examples.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that 'walm' corresponds to the repetition of the color associated with the previous word. Here's how it seems to work:

In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and following ""walm"" leads to ""green green green."" So, 'walm' after 'dax' repeats ""green"" three times.

In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

In the third example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.

In the fourth example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.

In the fifth example, it is just like the second example with ""zup,"" leading to ""yellow"" being repeated thrice following ""walm.""

Based on this, the rule for 'walm' seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the given examples.
From the given examples, we can induce a rule about what ""dax"" might represent. The consistent element across all the examples is that whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Every input instance where the word ""wif"" appears corresponds to an output that includes the color ""red."" 

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" means ""yellow"" regardless of its position in a sequence.
Rule: ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the word that comes before it. 

Evidence:
- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" and ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow.""
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""green red"" where ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""green"" precedes ""red.""
- In the third example, it's just ""zup bluf"" which translates to ""yellow yellow"" repeating the color of ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf"" gives ""red red"" and ""zup"" stands alone as ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax bluf"" gives ""green green,"" confirming the rule.

Therefore, bluf -> to repeat the color of the previous word.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Input: wif lug walm dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following correlations between the inputs and their outputs:

- Every instance of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the output.
- The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in the output.
- The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output.
- The word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" when it occurs just before ""wif.""
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" when it occurs just before ""zup.""
- The word ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when followed by ""dax.""

To establish the rule for ""dax,"" we can ignore the translations for other words, as those are consistent and do not seem to impact the meaning of ""dax."" Instead, we look solely at the appearance of ""dax"" and its consistent translation to ""green,"" regardless of its position or the words around it.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Every time ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the same position.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

The term ""zup"" in each example correlates with the word ""yellow"" in the output.

- Input: ""zup lug wif"" includes the term ""zup"", and the corresponding output starts with ""yellow"".
- Input: ""zup lug"" includes the term ""zup"", and the corresponding output starts with ""yellow"".
- Input: ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" includes the term ""zup"", and the corresponding output has ""yellow"" in the fourth position, matching the position of ""zup"" in the input.
- Input: ""zup wif lug zup walm"" includes the term ""zup"" twice, and the corresponding output has ""yellow"" in the positions where ""zup"" appears.
- Input: ""dax walm wif walm zup"" includes the term ""zup"" at the end, and the corresponding output ends with ""yellow"".

Therefore, based on the given examples, the definition of ""zup"" consistently aligns with the color ""yellow"".
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the patterns in each input and the corresponding output. We can see that the output seems to directly correlate to the inputs. Let's closely examine the correlation:

1. Input: dax bluf            Output: green green
2. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf    Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
3. Input: dax lug bluf        Output: green blue blue
4. Input: zup bluf            Output: yellow yellow
5. Input: lug bluf zup        Output: blue blue yellow

From these examples we can infer the following:

- The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Now, let's see what happens when ""bluf"" is added. 

In examples 1 and 4, ""bluf"" is used after ""dax"" and ""zup,"" respectively. Each time, the color that corresponds with the word before ""bluf"" is repeated. In example 1, ""dax bluf"" becomes ""green green,"" and in example 4, ""zup bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow."" 

In examples 2 and 3, ""bluf"" is used following ""lug."" In example 2, we see ""zup bluf"" within a larger sequence, and it results in ""yellow yellow."" In example 3, ""dax lug bluf"" results in ""green blue blue,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and we get ""blue"" which is what ""lug"" corresponds to, repeated once more.

Example 5, ""lug bluf zup,"" shows ""bluf"" after ""lug"" and it again results in a repetition of ""blue,"" before the sequence ends with ""zup,"" corresponding to ""yellow."" 

From these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" is a command to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word.
From the examples provided, we can determine that the nonce word ""walm"" is related to color repetitions. The repetition appears to be based on the color word that precedes it. Let's analyze the occurrences:

1. ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" must mean ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes the preceding color word ""blue"" to be repeated twice more, hence a total of three blues.

2. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue green blue blue blue."" Before the ""walm,"" there are two colors mentioned, ""dax"" and ""lug,"" which correspond to ""green"" and ""blue,"" respectively. ""Walm"" is following ""lug"" and it repeats ""blue"" twice more.

3. ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue."" Here, ""wif"" must mean red, and ""walm"" repeats ""red"" two more times after it's first mentioned.

4. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" In this instance, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" and then ""yellow"" is repeated twice more. ""wif"" follows, which we have established to mean ""red,"" but it is not repeated because it was not directly preceded by ""walm.""

5. ""lug walm wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red."" ""Lug"" again translates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated twice more. The ""wif"" which means ""red"" is not affected by the ""walm"" because ""walm"" did not precede ""wif.""

Based on these examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be the repetition of the last color word's meaning twice more. Therefore:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the immediately preceding color word two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. ""lug"" always translates to ""blue"" in the output, no matter the surrounding context.
2. The other words (dax, zup, wif, walm) are also consistent in their translation to a color but are not directly correlated with ""lug.""

Thus, we can conclude the following rule for ""lug"":

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: Regardless of what precedes it, dax corresponds to the output ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" maps to the color ""yellow"" regardless of context within the given examples.
bluf -> the same color as the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another word, the output color for ""bluf"" is the same as the color output for the word that precedes it. If ""bluf"" is the first word, this rule cannot be applied due to insufficient information.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to represent a repeated color based on the word that comes before it. Specifically, it seems to indicate that the color associated with the preceding word should be repeated three times. Here are the observations:

- ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" translates to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"", so ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times after ""zup.""
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"", so ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times after ""dax.""
- ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"", so ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times after ""lug.""
- ""dax walm wif walm"" translates to ""green green green red red red"", so ""walm"" repeats ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""red"" for ""wif.""
- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"", so ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times after ""zup.""

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color green in all the provided examples, regardless of its position or the presence of other words around it.
To deduce the meaning of 'wif,' let's analyze how it translates to color in each example:

1. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   blue blue red blue red red red blue

2. zup wif lug
   yellow red blue

3. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   green blue blue blue green red red green

4. wif walm dax zup
   red red red green yellow

5. zup wif zup dax
   yellow red yellow green

From the examples given, 'wif' seems to consistently translate to 'red.' No matter the position of 'wif' in the sequence or the words around it, the output is always 'red.' Based on the information provided, I would conclude:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, where the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input, we can induce that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" always results in the repetition of the color word that precedes it. Therefore, ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the previously mentioned color in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color word that comes before bluf.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at each instance where it appears and the corresponding outputs.

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green

Here, before ""walm,"" we have ""dax"" which corresponds to green, after ""walm"" we have ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow. So ""walm"" here is linked to a green output (the same as the preceding element).

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

In this case, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" (yellow) and the output for ""walm"" is yellow as well.

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow

Here, ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" (blue) and the output is blue again.

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

""Walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and the output for ""walm"" is yellow once more.

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

""Walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and the output is blue again.

Based on the examples, ""walm"" seems to take on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to ""blue"" in the output. The word following ""lug"" is translated to a different color, for instance, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""bluf"" to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" to ""yellow,"" but ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position or the words around it.
dax -> green

Rule: The word 'dax' corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position or the context within the sequence it is used.
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Therefore:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" consistently in all given examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", we should look for patterns between the input and output pairs.

1. ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" -> ""green yellow red red blue"" 
2. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue"" 
3. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
4. ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" -> ""red red blue green red""
5. ""zup bluf lug zup"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow""

Looking at the examples, it appears that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. The first three, dax, zup, and wif, correspond to green, yellow, and red, respectively. The word bluf always corresponds to the color that was mentioned directly before it.

Based on this pattern, the rule seems to be:

bluf -> the same color as the word immediately preceding it in the sequence. 

Rule: If x corresponds to a certain color, then ""x bluf"" corresponds to that color repeated.
walm -> green

Rule: The word ""walm"" corresponds to the color green in the outputs provided.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
To deduce the meaning or rule behind ""dax,"" let's compare the inputs with their respective outputs, focusing on where ""dax"" appears and what color it translates to in the output.

1. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" at the end.

2. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   - The first ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" at the beginning.
   - The second ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" after two ""blue"" and before ""red.""
   - The third ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" at the end again.

3. Input: lug bluf dax lug
   Output: blue blue green blue
   - Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" between two ""blue.""

4. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow
   - ""dax"" at the beginning corresponds to ""green.""

5. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
   Output: red green red red yellow red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" between two ""red.""

After examining all instances, it seems the rule for ""dax"" doesn't depend on its position or surrounding words. In every instance, ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" seems to consistently correspond to the color ""red."" We notice that no matter where ""wif"" appears in the sequence, it is translated to ""red"" in the output. 

Here are the correlations observed in the provided examples:

1. ""wif lug zup"" -> ""red blue yellow""
2. ""lug zup wif"" -> ""blue yellow red""
3. ""dax walm wif walm"" -> ""green green green red red red"" (Noticing that ""walm"" correlates to a repeated ""green"")
4. ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" -> ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red""
5. ""lug wif dax"" -> ""blue red green""

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Therefore, 

wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in every example provided.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs:

1. dax zup lug zup bluf -> green yellow blue yellow yellow
2. lug bluf -> blue blue
3. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
4. zup wif dax wif bluf -> yellow red green red red
5. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow

Upon examination, it appears that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. The task is to determine what color ""bluf"" corresponds to based on the pattern.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is associated with the color ""yellow,"" as are the preceding and subsequent ""zup.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" directly follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and the output associated with ""bluf"" is also ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" once again and both correspond to ""red"" in the output.

From these observations, it appears that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> The color corresponding to the word that comes before ""bluf.""
walm -> repeat the color of the previous word.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears in a sequence, the color associated with ""walm"" is the same as the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in every example provided.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently maps to the output ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input string or the surrounding words. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as:

dax -> green

Rule: The presence of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
Based on the examples provided, the rule I can deduce for the nonce word ""wif"" is as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, each ""bluf"" corresponds to two color words in the output. The specific colors are not consistently the same which suggests the meaning of ""bluf"" could be dependent on the words that come before it. However, in every instance, ""bluf"" results in two consecutive color words in the output. It appears that ""bluf"" could mean ""repeat the color word that comes right before 'bluf'.""

If we analyze the examples:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" indicating ""bluf"" repeats the previous color ""red.""
- In the second example, again, we see ""wif bluf"" translating to ""red red,"" supporting the idea of repetition. 
- The third example also shows ""zup bluf"" resulting in ""yellow yellow,"" which continues the pattern.
- The fourth example, ""lug bluf,"" becomes ""blue blue,"" which is again consistent with repetition.
- The fifth example, ""wif bluf,"" results in ""red red,"" which aligns with the previous instances.

So the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes the last color mentioned and repeats it twice.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the last mentioned color twice.
Based on the examples provided, we can infer a pattern wherein ""walm"" results in the word ""blue"" being repeated a number of times equal to the number of words preceding ""walm"" within the input sequence, plus one. For example:

- In the first input ""zup walm lug,"" ""walm"" results in the output ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" The output ""yellow"" corresponds to the word ""zup,"" and ""walm"" translates to three instances of ""blue,"" corresponding to the fact that there was one word (""zup"") before ""walm.""
  
- In the second input ""lug wif walm,"" ""walm"" produces ""red red red,"" indicating that two words (""lug"" and ""wif"") precede it, plus one additional instance of ""red.""

- In the third input ""dax lug walm,"" ""walm"" again results in three instances of the word ""blue"" in the output.

- When ""walm"" immediately follows ""lug"" without another word in between (as in the fourth input ""lug walm""), ""walm"" corresponds to two instances of ""blue"" since there is one word before it.

- In the fifth input ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif,"" we can observe that the first occurrence of ""walm"" follows three words and hence results in four instances of ""blue"" whereas the second occurrence of ""walm"" follows one word, resulting in two instances of ""yellow,"" followed by ""red"" for the final word ""wif.""

With these patterns in mind, we can state the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the last word before ""walm"" in the output, the number of times equal to one plus the number of words preceding ""walm"" in the input sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue
Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently maps to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" Here's the correlation observed:

1. Every time ""dax"" is mentioned, the output includes the color ""green.""
2. ""Dax"" appears to be independent of its position within the input sequence; whether it begins, ends, or is in the middle of the sequence, the output ""green"" follows its position.
3. No other word in the examples given translates to ""green"" in the output.

Thus, we can deduce the rule as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in a sequence of words.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" likely represents the color that comes immediately before it in the sequence. The pattern shows that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word preceding it each time. Here's how:

1. lug bluf => blue blue
2. wif bluf => red red
3. wif bluf (within a longer sequence) => red red
4. zup bluf => yellow yellow

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the output.

When ""walm"" appears as an input:
- It always corresponds to a sequence of red in the output.

One potential confusion comes from the examples where ""wif"" is also present:
- ""wif"" alone corresponds to red.
- ""walm"" with ""wif"" also produces a sequence of red, but it is indistinguishable whether it's because of ""wif"" or ""walm.""

However, looking at the third example:
- ""zup lug walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue""
- Here, ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of blue.

Taking that into consideration, it appears ""walm"" is not contributing a fixed color; instead, it repeats the color of the token that comes right before it. Let's verify with the remaining examples:

In the fourth example:
- ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red""
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in repeating red, which is the output color for ""wif.""

In the fifth example:
- ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" -> ""blue blue red blue red red red blue""
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and repeats red, the output color for ""wif.""

Now we can conclude that ""walm"" means to repeat the color output of the previous word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color output of the previous word in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Rule: The word 'lug' corresponds to the color blue in all the provided examples.
dax -> meaning. Rule: The word dax corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of the context it appears in.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" There is no variation in the output when ""wif"" is present regardless of its position in the input string or the words surrounding it. Therefore, we can deduce a rule for the meaning of ""wif.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence of words.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" functions as a sort of duplicator or repeater of the color associated with the word preceding it. The word that comes before ""bluf"" is translated into a color, and then that color is repeated in the output. Here is the breakdown:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""bluf"" causes this color to be repeated. 
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" repeats it.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" repeats it.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" repeats it.

So, in essence, the rule for ""bluf"" is as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" duplicates the color that is associated with the word immediately preceding it.
walm -> the color associated with the preceding word repeated three times. Rule: If a word precedes 'walm', output the color associated with that word three times. For ""dax walm,"" since ""dax"" is associated with green, the output is ""green green green."" For ""wif walm,"" since ""wif"" is associated with red, the output is ""red red red,"" and so on.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds directly to the color ""blue."" Each example where ""lug"" is present, the output includes the color ""blue."" Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in each given example, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
wif -> meaning. 

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, the output contains ""red"". The other words likely correspond to other colors, but the specific rule for ""wif"" is consistent: it correlates to ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" always results in the output ""yellow."" Therefore, regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words, ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow,"" indicating that its meaning is independent of the context in which it appears. Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, the rule for ""walm"" appears consistent: when ""walm"" follows a word, the output is three repetitions of the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""walm."" Let's examine each input-output pair to confirm this rule:

- Input: wif walm -> Outout: red red red
  ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and when ""walm"" immediately follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red.""
  
- Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
  The last color word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" so the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
  
- Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
  The word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" so the output is ""blue blue blue.""
  
- Input: lug walm
  ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
  
- Input: dax walm zup lug dax
  The word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" so the output is ""green green green.""

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" causes the output to be three consecutive instances of the color associated with the preceding word.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" is consistently resulting in the output ""blue.""

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output.
By analyzing the examples provided where the nonce word ""dax"" appears, we can attempt to determine the rule that dictates the color outcome associated with ""dax"". Here's a breakdown of the instances:

- First example: ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green"".
- Second example: ""dax lug"" corresponds to ""green blue"".
- Third example: ""dax walm"" again corresponds to ""green green green"".
- Fourth example: ""dax lug dax"" corresponds to ""green blue green"".
- Fifth example: ""dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green red red"".

Notably, whenever ""dax"" appears, it is followed by the color ""green"". Considering this consistent pattern, we can infer a rule about ""dax"":

Rule: ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"".

Therefore, the meaning of ""dax"" in the context of these examples appears to be the color ""green"".

dax -> meaning. Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"".
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following associations:

- ""walm"" consistently results in the output ""green"".
- ""lug"" consistently results in the output ""blue"".
- ""zup"" consistently results in the output ""yellow"".
- ""bluf"" is only present once and corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, but because ""zup"" also produced ""yellow"", we can't definitively assign ""yellow"" to ""bluf"" with one instance.

However, for each occurrence of ""wif"", regardless of its position in the input string, the output invariably includes ""red"". This consistent result allows us to establish a direct rule for ""wif"":

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: In every example provided, the term ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the output. Irrespective of the position of ""zup"" within the input, it consistently translates to yellow.
Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""red,"" consistently appearing as the output connected with the presence of the word ""bluf."" 

Thus, the rule is:

bluf -> red.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the pattern for the nonce word ""walm."" It seems that ""walm"" results in a sequence of ""red"" colored words that follow it. The number of ""red"" words appears to be directly connected to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence, indicating that ""walm"" might mean to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it as many times as its position in the sequence. We can illustrate this with each example:

1. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
   Rule: ""wif"" is red, ""walm"" causes the next two words to be red because ""walm"" is the second word.

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Rule: ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" causes the next two words to be blue because ""walm"" is the second word.

3. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   Rule: ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" causes the next three words to be blue because ""walm"" is the fourth word.

4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Rule: ""wif"" is red, ""walm"" causes the next three words to be red because ""walm"" is the fourth word.

5. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   Rule: ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" causes the next two words to be blue because ""walm"" is the second word.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word as many times as the ordinal position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Based on the examples provided:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- ""walm"" translates to ""red red red.""

When ""wif"" appears before a word, the output always starts with ""red"" followed by the color associated with the word that follows it. When ""wif"" appears after a word, the output is the color associated with that word followed by ""red."" In single-word cases, the output lacks a second color term, so it's reasonable to say that ""wif"" by itself translates to ""red.""

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red"", and when used as a connector between two words, it places the color associated with itself (""red"") before or after the color associated with the next or previous word, respectively.
Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> yellow

Each instance of the word ""bluf"" in the examples corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, walm seems to cause the preceding word's associated color to repeat in the output. Here's how the pattern plays out:

- In the first example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so after ""walm,"" we see ""blue"" repeated.
- In the second example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and following ""walm,"" we have ""red"" repeated.
- In the third example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" again, and so ""blue"" is repeated after ""walm.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" once more, and ""blue"" is the color repeated.
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" yet again, leading to a repetition of ""blue.""

Rule: The word ""lug"" in the examples consistently translates to the color ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" seems to correspond with the color ""red."" Whenever we see ""wif"" in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.

Here are the associations based on the examples:

- When ""bluf"" and ""walm"" follow ""wif,"" the output is ""red red green green green."" Since ""wif"" is the first word, and the first color in the output is ""red,"" this suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- When ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red,"" which supports the association between ""wif"" and ""red.""
- When ""wif"" follows ""zup,"" the output sequence includes ""red,"" suggesting that the presence of ""wif"" produces ""red"" in the output. The word ""zup"" seems to be associated with ""yellow.""
- ""wif lug zup bluf"" results in ""red blue yellow yellow,"" showing that regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the sequence, ""red"" appears in the output corresponding to its position.
- When ""lug wif"" appears, the output is ""blue red,"" with ""red"" again corresponding to ""wif.""

These observations lead to the rule:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" seems to be that each instance of ""zup"" produces the output ""yellow"". Furthermore, it appears that other words in the input correspond to different colors consistently.

Here's the breakdown according to the given examples:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- bluf -> green (noted from the third and fourth examples)

With this in mind, ""zup"" seems to consistently lead to the output ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that accompany it. Hence, the rule for ""zup"" appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: The word following ""bluf"" repeats the color corresponding to the word prior to ""bluf.""

Examples:
- In ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which before ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red."" Therefore, after ""bluf,"" ""wif"" is repeated as ""red red.""
- In ""zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" Therefore, it is ""yellow yellow"" when ""bluf"" is in the sequence.
- In ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" which before ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green."" Therefore, after ""bluf,"" ""dax"" is ""green green.""

Thus, bluf -> meaning: bluf causes the next word to repeat the color associated with the previous word.
walm -> meaning. Based on the examples, walm appears to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Rule: walm takes on the color word that comes before it in the sequence.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" each time it appears.
Based on the examples provided:

- In the first example, ""dax wif walm"" outputs ""green red red red,"" suggesting that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" 
- In the second example, ""zup lug dax"" outputs ""yellow blue green,"" further supporting that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" as the other two words map to different colors.
- The third example is ""dax lug wif walm,"" which outputs ""green blue red red red,"" and again, ""dax"" aligns with ""green.""
- The fourth example with the single word ""dax"" outputs ""green,"" confirming the one-to-one correspondence between ""dax"" and ""green.""
- Finally, the fifth example, ""zup dax bluf,"" outputs ""yellow green green,"" which suggests that ""dax"" could still represent ""green,"" and ""bluf"" might also mean green, or ""bluf” operates under a different rule (but this is not the focus of our current induction). 

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in every provided example.
Based on the given examples, zup seems to be associated with the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Every time it appears, the output includes the word ""yellow"". Therefore, the underlying rule for zup can be summarized as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Analyzing the examples provided:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
2. wif bluf -> red red
3. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green
4. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red

Observations:
- In examples 1 and 2, the word ""bluf"" is repeated after the word ""zup"" and ""wif,"" respectively, and the output is a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.
- In example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is again a repetition of ""yellow.""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" is used twice: after ""zup"" with the same ""yellow yellow"" pattern, and after ""wif"" with the ""red red"" pattern. 

Rule: The word ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Therefore, the rule can be that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the previously mentioned color.

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""walm"" seems to be dependent upon the word that precedes it. The word ""walm"" takes on the color associated with the preceding word but repeats that color three times in the output. Let's examine the examples given:

- In ""dax walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and then ""walm"" causes the color green to be repeated three times.
- In ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"", we see that ""wif"" has a corresponding color red, which is repeated thrice following ""walm"". Similarly, ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and ""walm"" repeats the color yellow three times after it.
- ""zup wif walm"" shows that when ""wif"" proceeds ""walm"", we get red repeated three times.
- Likewise, ""lug wif walm"" demonstrates that when ""wif"" proceeds ""walm"", red is repeated three times.
- Finally, ""lug walm"" indicates that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and ""walm"" repeats the color blue three times.

Therefore, the rule is as follows: 

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times. If the preceding word is ""dax"", ""walm"" outputs ""green"" three times; if the preceding word is ""lug"", it outputs ""blue"" three times; and so forth for other color-associated words.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow,yellow yellow yellow,True,105
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output. Consequently, the rule appears to be:

lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue.""
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Every instance of ""dax"" in the input is matched with ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position or the other words around it.
Based on the examples given, we can infer that ""wif"" correlates to the color ""red."" Thus the rule is:

wif -> red

Each time the input contains the word ""wif"" the output always includes ""red,"" regardless of what other words are present or their order in the sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in each given example.
Based on the given examples, it seems the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color output. To determine the specific rule or meaning behind ""bluf,"" let's look at each of the inputs and their respective outputs:

1. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
2. zup wif bluf zup -> yellow red red yellow
3. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
4. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
5. wif bluf dax -> red red green

From these examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" always corresponds to an output of ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input or the other words present.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" corresponds to the color red.
Analyzing the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, one can attempt to induce the rule that governs the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Here is the analysis:

1. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

5. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

Based on the outputs, we can observe that the color following ""walm"" is always the same as the color that immediately precedes it.

In example 1, the color preceding ""walm"" is red, and the color following ""walm"" is also red.

In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which outputs yellow, and the color after ""walm"" is also yellow.

In example 3 and 4, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""wif,"" which correspond to green and red, respectively, and after ""walm,"" the color repeats as green and red, respectively.

Finally, in example 5, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which outputs blue, and the color after ""walm"" is also blue.

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" appears in an input, it makes the output repeat the color of the word that precedes it.

So:

walm -> meaning: The output color should repeat the color of the word that directly precedes ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,106
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"". Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug means blue.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in each instance where it is used. The position of ""dax"" within the sequence of words does not seem to alter its meaning. Therefore, we can deduce:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" is consistently translated to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in a sequence of words.
From the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red."" Every instance where ""wif"" is used in the input, ""red"" appears the same number of times in the output sequence. No other input word consistently corresponds to ""red"" in these examples. 

The rule thus deduced is:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" represents the color ""red"" in the outputs.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" appears to correspond directly to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence provided. The context does not provide additional conditions that change the meaning of ""zup,"" so it consistently means ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided where the word ""bluf"" appears and considering the corresponding outputs, ""bluf"" seems to replicate the color output of the word that precedes it, if there is one. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow."" When it follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue."" 

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word. If the preceding word outputs ""yellow,"" then ""bluf"" also outputs ""yellow."" If the preceding word outputs ""blue,"" then ""bluf"" outputs ""blue,"" and so on. If there is no preceding word color mentioned, it would require additional examples to determine the rule.
walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, the output is the color associated with the preceding word repeated three times for a single preceding word and four times if there are two preceding words. In the given examples, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. When followed by ""walm,"" the color of the word before ""walm"" is repeated three times for ""dax"" and ""zup"". When an additional word like ""lug"" is introduced before ""walm"", which has no color associated, the rule slightly changes and leads to the color being repeated four times. However, since there's no example directly associating a color with ""lug,"" we cannot definitively determine if ""lug"" impacts the color or the count. Thus, we focus on the clear pattern that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the preceding color word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently represented by the color blue in every example provided.
Based on the examples provided, each instance of a word is paired with a corresponding color in the Output. Therefore, we can infer the meaning of ""dax"" as well as other words by analyzing their respective outputs. Here's the breakdown of each word with its associated color based on the consistent patterns in the examples:

- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" seems to consistently correspond to ""red"" (although this may be a mistake and could be meant to correspond to ""blue"", but there's only one instance, so it's hard to confirm)
- ""zup"" is seen only once and corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" appears only once and corresponds to ""blue""

Based on the above, the rule is:

Rule: Each nonce word in the input is associated with a specific color in the output. 

Therefore, the meaning of ""dax"" within this context is:

dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

1. ""wif lug"" always results in ""red blue"".
2. ""zup bluf wif bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow red red"". Here, ""zup bluf"" seems to correspond to ""yellow yellow"" and thus the ""wif bluf"" at the end corresponds to ""red red"".
3. ""wif dax lug"" corresponds to ""red green blue"". Since we already know ""wif lug"" is ""red blue"", we can assume that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Given the consistency irrespective of the presence of other words, ""wif"" seems to correspond to the color ""red"". Therefore, the rule seems to attribute a color to each word.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the provided examples, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the rule of what ""bluf"" means when translating each given phrase into a sequence of colors.

Looking at each instance of ""bluf"":
1. When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow.""
2. When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""green green.""
3. No matter the preceding word (""wif"" or ""lug""), when ""bluf"" is the last word, the color repeated is the color that corresponded to the word just before ""bluf.""

Given this pattern, it seems that ""bluf"" functions as a rule to repeat the color of the preceding word. Therefore the meaning I deduce is:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color indicated by the word immediately before ""bluf"".
walm -> meaning. Meaning can be ""three repetitions of the color associated with the previous word."" 

Rule: When the word 'walm' appears, it dictates that the color associated with the word immediately preceding 'walm' should be repeated three times. For example, in ""lug walm dax"", 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', so 'walm' translates to 'blue blue blue'. In ""zup walm"", 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', so 'walm' translates to 'yellow yellow yellow'.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Rule: Whenever the input contains ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a color. Here is the mapping from the examples:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" causes the color of the previous word to be repeated. (Example 2: ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in ""green green green"". Example 4: ""bluf"" is not provided in the examples and does not affect the outcomes. It might be a distractor or has no output associated with it.)

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, each unique word seems to correspond to a specific color in the output. The word ""wif"" appears consistently in all examples, and each time it's present, the corresponding color in the output is ""red.""

Here are the associations from the given examples:
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> red
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- walm -> red

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"". Each instance of ""zup"" in the input correlates directly with ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence of words. Therefore, the rule I can deduce is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" maps to a color in the output. Observing the consistent output across all examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> green
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color named by the word immediately preceding it three times. Here's how the word ""walm"" is interpreted in each example:

1. lug walm -> blue blue blue
2. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue (Here, ""zup"" produces 'yellow' and ""lug"" produces 'blue', but only ""lug"" is immediately before ""walm"", so ""walm"" repeats 'blue' three times.)
3. wif walm zup walm -> red red red yellow yellow yellow (Both ""wif"" and ""zup"" precede their own ""walm"" and are thus repeated three times as 'red' and 'yellow' respectively.)
4. dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue (Again, each ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""lug"", repeating 'green' and 'blue' three times each.)
5. lug walm -> blue blue blue (This is the same as the first example, confirming the repetition rule.)

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word immediately before ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning is blue.

Rule: Whenever the term ""lug"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue.""
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in each provided example.
Based on the given examples, we need to find the rule that connects the input containing the nonce word ""wif"" to the output colors. 

From the examples:

1. Input: wif
   Output: red
   
Indicates that ""wif"" on its own corresponds to ""red.""

2. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow

Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" and the output is ""red yellow."" It indicates that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red

We see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" as before corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" also corresponds to ""green,"" followed by ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   
""bluf"" is a new word and corresponds to ""red."" Since we have established ""wif"" also corresponds to ""red,"" we now have two instances of ""red red.""

5. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue

This confirms that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to be consistently associated with ""green."" However, in this example, ""walm"" is resulting in ""blue blue,"" which might indicate that ""walm"" affects the following word(s), doubling them. It's notable that in example 3, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" with the output ""green green red,"" which doesn't follow the pattern from example 5 where ""walm"" is duplicated. Therefore, the effect of ""walm"" on the word following it seems inconsistent or context-dependent.

From these examples, it can be inferred that:

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""
- The other words each correspond to their own respective colors.
- ""walm"" has some contextual effect that causes duplication, but not consistently across these examples.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. When ""zup"" is present alone, the output is ""yellow.""

wif -> red. When ""wif"" is present alongside ""zup,"" the output includes ""red"" in addition to the ""yellow"" that ""zup"" signifies.

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when combined with ""wif,"" the phrase ""zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow red.""
bluf -> red

Rule: Based on the given examples where ""bluf"" occurs, the output consistently corresponds to ""red."" Therefore, the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, each instance of the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a sequential repetition of the color that follows it. For instance, ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and when ""walm"" is used before ""lug,"" the output is multiple instances of the color ""blue."" Observing the different examples, ""walm"" consistently results in repeating the ensuing color:

- In example 1, ""walm lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes the preceding color ""yellow"" to be repeated three times, followed by ""lug"" which is ""blue.""
- In example 2, ""zup walm dax wif bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow green red red,"" where ""walm"" precedes ""dax,"" leading to a repetition of the color ""yellow"" before ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
- In example 3, ""wif walm lug bluf"" results in ""red red red blue blue,"" meaning ""walm"" caused ""red"" to repeat thrice before ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which is ""red red.""
- In example 4, ""dax wif walm"" results in ""green red red red,"" where ""walm"" again causes ""red"" to repeat thrice after ""wif,"" which is ""red.""
- In example 5, ""wif dax lug walm"" results in ""red green blue blue blue,"" with ""walm"" making ""blue"" (corresponding to ""lug"") repeat three times after it.

walm -> meaning. Rule: When preceding a color representation, ""walm"" causes the previous color to be repeated three times before the following color is presented.

Rule:
""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" Regardless of its position in a sequence or the context, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the word ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green

Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green.""
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Observing the output for each input where ""wif"" is present always includes the color ""red."" The position of ""wif"" in the input sequence does not seem to matter; its presence alone guarantees the inclusion of ""red"" in the output sequence at the corresponding position.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position within the input sequence or the presence of other words.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" has its meaning dependent on the word that precedes it. We can infer the following relations:

- When preceded by ""wif"", the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"".
- When preceded by ""dax"", the output for ""bluf"" is ""green"".
- When preceded by ""zup"", the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow"".
- When preceded by ""lug"", the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue"".

Given this pattern, we can deduce that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it but repeats it twice. Therefore:

Rule: bluf -> The word ""bluf"" represents a repetition of the color associated with the word directly preceding it.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. The relationship between the input and output is as follows:

- ""dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue blue blue,"" which means ""walm"" repeated the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) three times.
- ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" outputs ""green blue blue blue green red red green,"" which means ""walm"" again repeated the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) three times, ""dax"" is green, ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" doesn't seem to conform to a specific rule likely due to a typing error (assuming ""bluf"" should be ""wif"", it would follow the pattern with red being repeated).
- ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red,"" following the rule, ""walm"" repeats the red color of ""wif"" three times.
- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" following the rule, ""walm"" repeats the yellow color of ""zup"" three times.
- ""dax walm zup walm"" outputs ""green green green yellow yellow yellow,"" conforming to the rule as ""walm"" repeats the green color of ""dax"" and the yellow color of ""zup"" three times each.

    Rules:

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples, whenever the word dax appears in the input, the word green appears in the exact same position in the output.
Analyzing the provided Input/Output pairs:

1. wif seems to correlate with the color 'red':

    - 'zup dax wif' correlates with 'yellow yellow green red'
    - 'wif dax wif' correlates with 'red green red'
    - 'zup wif bluf' correlates with 'yellow red red'
    - 'lug wif lug walm zup walm wif' correlates with 'blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red'
    - 'wif zup lug zup lug' correlates with 'red yellow blue yellow blue'

2. The other words correlate with specific colors:

    - 'zup' correlates with the color 'yellow'
    - 'dax' correlates with the color 'green' (except when preceded by 'wif', where it seems to generate the color 'yellow')
    - 'lug' correlates with the color 'blue'
    - 'walm' correlates with the color 'blue'

3. The rule for 'wif' seems consistent regardless of the other words around it; it always results in the color 'red'. There is no evident change in output based on context or other words present.

Given the above observations, the meaning deduced for the nonce word 'wif' appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. This is evident as every instance of ""bluf"" in the input is translated to ""red"" in the output, regardless of the other words or their order.

Rule: bluf -> red
Meaning: The word ""bluf"" means ""red"".
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word

Based on the examples provided, the appearance of the nonce word ""walm"" results in the output being multiple repetitions of the color associated with the word directly preceding ""walm"". Each word corresponds to a specific color: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""dax"" corresponds to green. When ""walm"" appears, it takes the color of the word before it and repeats it a number of times.

To illustrate:

- In the first example, ""zup walm wif"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""walm"" outputs ""yellow"" three times before the pattern changes with the introduction of ""wif"" which is red.
- In the second example, ""dax lug dax lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue. Thus, ""walm"" outputs ""blue"" four times as it repeats the color of ""lug"".
- In the third example, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"", ""wif"" corresponds to red. ""Walm"" outputs red three times after ""wif,"" before the pattern changes back to blue with ""lug"".
- In the fourth example, ""dax walm lug"", ""dax"" corresponds to green. Thus, ""walm"" outputs ""green"" three times, followed by ""lug"" which is blue.
- In the fifth example, ""lug zup dax walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to green. Thus, ""walm"" outputs ""green"" three times following ""dax.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" results in the color of the preceding word being repeated multiple times (three times in each provided example). The number of repetitions might be fixed at three, as that is the only frequency observed, but if more examples showed a different number of repetitions this rule might need to be revised. For now, it appears consistent across the provided examples.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word that precedes it.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to represent a rule where the color ""red"" is repeated. It is probably a command that turns the following word's color into red until a new color command is encountered.

For instance, in the first example, the pattern ""zup dax walm zup wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green yellow red"". Here, the word ""walm"" falls between ""dax"" (green) and ""zup"" (yellow), but instead of turning ""zup"" into its corresponding color yellow, ""walm"" causes the next word to turn red, which then continues until a new color word is introduced.

In every example, after the word ""walm"", the color red is repeated until a different color word appears (""dax"" for green, ""zup"" for yellow, etc). This suggests that ""walm"" does not have a one-to-one correspondence with a particular color, but rather sets a rule for the words that follow.

Rule: walm -> Causes the following words to output the color ""red"" until a new color command is encountered.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. The word 'lug' consistently corresponds to the color 'blue' in every example provided.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""
From the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Following each instance of ""wif,"" there is an output ""red."" This pattern persists regardless of the other words that follow ""wif."" Therefore, the rule appears to be:

wif -> red

Rule: When ""wif"" is present in the input, it translates to the color ""red"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. 

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples given, we can deduce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"":

In every output, the word ""bluf"" is translated to ""green"" except when it appears immediately after the word ""lug,"" in which case it translates to ""blue."" Therefore, ""bluf"" might mean ""green"" but changes to ""blue"" when following the word ""lug.""

Rule: bluf -> ""green"" generally, but when preceded by ""lug,"" it means ""blue"".
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's analyze the examples provided and compare the inputs and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   
   After ""dax,"" we get ""green;"" ""walm"" following ""dax"" continues the sequence of ""green."" ""wif"" leads to a ""red,"" and ""lug"" changes the output to ""blue."" Then ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" continues the sequence of ""green.""

2. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   
   ""dax"" turns the output to ""green,"" and ""zup"" changes it to ""yellow."" ""walm"" after ""zup"" maintains the sequence of ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" changes it to ""red.""

3. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   
   Starting with ""zup"" makes it ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" keeps it ""yellow."" ""lug"" changes the output to ""blue,"" then ""zup"" back to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

4. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   
   ""dax"" outputs ""green,"" ""lug"" changes it to ""blue,"" another ""dax"" again to ""green,"" and another ""lug"" to ""blue."" After the sequence of ""lug,"" ""walm"" keeps it ""blue.""

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   
   ""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" maintains ""yellow.""

Rule: ""walm"" seems to maintain the color (output) of the previous word, not changing it.

So, the rule for ""walm"" is that it continues the sequence of the output color without changing it.

Rule: walm -> continues the previous color output without change.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in each example provided, regardless of the position of ""lug"" within the input sequence or the other words present.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"", regardless of its position in the input or the context.
Based on the provided examples, it looks like the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" Therefore, the rule can be inferred as:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of the word ""zup"" in the examples corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. There is a consistent one-to-one mapping between the nonce word ""zup"" and the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input string.
From the given examples, it is apparent that each word corresponds to a color, and the color that is assigned to each word is repeated for every occurrence of that word. Now let's deduce the rule for 'bluf':

- In the first example, ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red."" We see that 'wif' and 'bluf' both correspond to 'red'.
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" which supports the observation that 'bluf' corresponds to 'red'.
- In the third example, ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue green green"". 'bluf' cannot be 'green' here because 'dax' already corresponds to 'green,' and 'bluf' follows 'dax'. This suggests 'bluf' might mean a repetition of the last color mentioned before 'bluf,' which is 'green' in this case.
- In the fourth example, ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow green yellow green red red."" Here again, 'bluf' follows 'wif' and results in 'red', which was the color corresponding to 'wif'.
- In the fifth example, ""wif zup bluf"" translates to ""red yellow yellow."" The occurrence of 'bluf' results in 'yellow', which is the color corresponding to the preceding word 'zup'.

Putting these observations together, the rule for 'bluf' is that it results in the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding 'bluf'.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the output color for the word ""walm"" depends on the color output of the word immediately preceding it. Specifically, ""walm"" results in three repetitions of the color that the preceding word translates to. Here's the analysis:

- In the first input, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which outputs ""blue,"" so ""walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue"".
- In the second input, ""walm"" again follows ""lug"" with the output ""blue,"" so ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".
- In the third input, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which outputs ""green,"" hence ""walm"" results in ""green green green"".
- In the fourth input, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and since ""dax"" outputs ""green,"" ""walm"" results in ""green green green"" again.
- In the fifth input, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which outputs ""red,"" thus ""walm"" results in ""red red red"".

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" outputs the color of the preceding word three times in succession.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, lug consistently corresponds to the color blue. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

lug -> blue. Rule: Whenever lug is used in the input, the output is blue.
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position or the context within the given sequence.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"" and to ""green"" when preceded by ""dax."" However, when ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" or when it appears alone with ""zup,"" it translates to ""yellow."" Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" is influenced by the word that comes immediately before it.

bluf -> meaning:
- ""wif bluf"" -> red red
- ""dax bluf"" -> green green
- ""zup bluf"" -> yellow yellow when ""bluf"" is not preceded by ""dax"" or ""wif"" 

When the word ""bluf"" is repeated after ""zup,"" the pattern persists with the second occurrence of ""bluf"" being yellow as well. In a sequence of words, each instance of ""bluf"" takes its color based on the immediately preceding word, without regard to the wider context.
From the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Let's consider how each example supports this rule:

1. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red"":
The color associated with ""wif"" is ""red,"" and after ""walm"" is mentioned, ""red"" is repeated three times.

2. ""lug dax walm wif"" -> ""blue green green green red"":
Here ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times before moving on to the next color associated with ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

3. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"":
Again, the color ""yellow,"" associated with ""zup,"" is repeated three times after ""walm.""

4. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"":
In this example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the associated color ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

5. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" -> ""red red green green red red red blue red"":
The pattern holds as ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""red"" is repeated three times before the sequence continues.

Based on this, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the directly preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Causes the previous color to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" in the provided examples always translates to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" is associated with the color green. Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, each time the nonce word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. From the examples:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- In the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- In the third example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and also causes the word before it to be repeated in the output (""green green"").
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning: yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it translates to ""yellow"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to examine the relationship between the input and the output.

1. Input: zup dax bluf — Output: yellow green green
2. Input: lug bluf — Output: blue blue
3. Input: lug wif bluf — Output: blue red red
4. Input: zup bluf — Output: yellow yellow
5. Input: lug walm wif bluf — Output: blue blue blue red red

Looking at these sequences, it appears that the output is a series of colors, each corresponding somehow to the words in the input. Here's what we can observe:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, its corresponding color appears twice in a row in the output.
- ""bluf"" follows a word or a pair of words. If the previous word in the input produces a color in the output, ""bluf"" results in that same color being repeated.

Using these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word in the output.

For example:
- In ""zup dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" results in green being repeated.
- In ""lug bluf,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""bluf"" results in blue being repeated.
- In ""lug wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""bluf"" results in red being repeated.
- In ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""bluf"" results in yellow being repeated.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color associated with the word directly preceding it. Each time ""walm"" appears in the input, the output repeats the corresponding color for the preceding word the same number of times as ""walm"" appears. Here is the analysis of the examples:

1. ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"", which indicates ""walm"" takes the color of ""zup"" (yellow) and repeats it three times.
2. ""dax walm wif"" outputs ""green green green red"", where ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"" (green) three times, followed by the color for ""wif"" (red).
3. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue red yellow red"", where ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" (blue) three times, and ""wif"" is red, while ""zup"" is yellow.
4. ""dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue blue blue"", where ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" (blue) three times.
5. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" outputs ""yellow red green green green blue"", where ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"" (green) three times.

Based on this analysis, the rule is:
Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the word directly preceding it, three times.

Therefore:
walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output. Each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to a ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position or the words around it.
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, bluf translates to the same color as the word preceding it. Here is the breakdown of the examples:

1. Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow
- Here bluf assumes the color of the word right before it, which is 'zup' (yellow).

2. Input: lug wif lug bluf -> Output: blue red blue blue
- 'bluf' takes the color of the word before it, 'lug' (blue).

3. Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
- 'bluf' again matches the color of 'zup' (yellow).

4. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> Output: red red green green red red red blue red
- 'bluf' takes the color of 'wif' (red), then 'dax' (green), and so on.

5. Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
- 'bluf' matches the color of 'zup' (yellow).

Rule: 
bluf -> the same color as the word that directly precedes it.
To determine the rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs and try to find a pattern:

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" may correspond to ""blue"" (based on this example)
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" may correspond to ""red"" (based on this example)
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" may correspond to ""yellow"" (based on this example)
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""

Output: green green green
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" may correspond to ""green"" (based on this example)

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" may correspond to ""blue"" (based on this example)
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Based on the examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" takes on the color value of the word that directly precedes it.

Rule: walm -> takes the color value of the previous word in the sequence. If there is no previous word, it cannot be determined based on the given examples.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Each time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" So the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" The rules for the other words appear consistent where each word corresponds to a specific color as well:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the previous color, in this case, ""blue blue""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". So, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
Analyzing the provided input-output pairs:

1. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug -> Output: yellow red red yellow blue
2. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif -> Output: green green red yellow red
3. Input: lug bluf -> Output: blue blue
4. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> Output: green blue yellow red red green
5. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax -> Output: green green yellow yellow green

Let's find out what ""bluf"" means in each sequence.

- In the first and third examples, ""bluf"" is followed by colors: ""bluf zup"" translates to ""red yellow"" and ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"". This shows that ""bluf"" might adopt the color value of the word that follows or precedes it.
- In the second example, ""bluf wif"" corresponds to ""green red"". Here, ""bluf"" takes the value ""green"" which is the same as the word ""dax"" before it, supporting the idea that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of adjacent words.
- The fourth example should clear any ambiguity left since ""bluf dax"" translates to ""red green"" which confirms the pattern that ""bluf"" takes the color value of the next word when followed by a word and possibly that of the preceding word when it is the last word in the sequence.
- The fifth example further solidifies this rule because ""bluf zup"" and ""zup bluf"" both translate to ""green yellow"" and ""yellow green"", respectively, showing that ""bluf"" matches the color of the adjacent word, be it after or before.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it takes on the color value of the word immediately next to it in the sequence, whether that word is before or after ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color value of the adjacent word.
walm -> triple the color associated with the previous word. Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, the color that is associated with that previous word is repeated three times.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words around it. Thus, we can deduce the rule for ""lug"" as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green. The rule is that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in an input, the corresponding output contains the color ""yellow.""
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns associated with its appearance in the input and its corresponding color in the output. By analyzing each example:

- In every instance where ""bluf"" appears, the color ""red"" is included in the output.
- ""Bluf"" does not always correspond to a single position in the output sequence; it can be in various positions. However, the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" does not seem to affect the color associated with ""bluf"", since different words (e.g., ""wif,"" ""lug"") yield the same result for ""bluf,"" which is ""red.""
- Additionally, the words that appear alongside ""bluf"" have their own consistent color mappings:
  - ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
  - ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
  - ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
  - ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Based on this analysis, it appears that the word ""bluf"" itself translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position or the words that come before or after it. Thus, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> red
Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it three times. 

For example:
- In ""zup dax walm,"" ""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" ""dax"" gives ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times.
- In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" gives ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times.
- In ""wif lug zup walm wif lug,"" ""wif"" gives ""red,"" ""lug"" gives ""blue,"" ""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times, then the pattern ""wif lug"" repeats with ""red blue.""
- In ""lug dax zup dax walm wif,"" ""lug"" gives ""blue,"" ""dax"" gives ""green,"" ""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" ""dax"" gives ""green"" again, ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times, and ""wif"" gives ""red.""
- In ""wif zup walm dax zup,"" ""wif"" gives ""red,"" ""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times, ""dax"" gives ""green,"" and ""zup"" gives ""yellow"" again.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" correlates with the color ""blue."" Here are the relationships in the provided examples:

- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
- ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the previous color, as seen in examples 2 and 4, where ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and ""lug"" respectively, and the output color repeats.

Therefore, the rule for ""lug"" seems to be:

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, every instance of the word ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. There are no counterexamples to this rule in the given data.
wif -> meaning. Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, it is possible to induce the following rule:

When the input term ""zup"" corresponds to the output term ""yellow,"" it can be inferred that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: The word bluf corresponds to the color immediately preceding it in the input sequence. If bluf is the first word, it takes the color of the word immediately following it. 

Based on the provided examples:

- Whenever we see ""lug bluf"" in the input, the output is ""blue blue."" This suggests that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the context following ""lug."" 
- When we have ""zup bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" takes on the meaning of ""yellow"" following ""zup.""
- With ""dax bluf,"" the output is ""green green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" here translates to ""green"" after ""dax.""
- In the case of ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""bluf"" directly follows ""zup"" and therefore becomes ""yellow."" But ""walm"" doesn't directly precede or follow ""bluf,"" and there's no example of ""walm bluf"" or ""bluf walm."" However, based on the output ""red red red"" for ""wif walm,"" it could be inferred that ""walm"" itself corresponds to ""red,"" although this pattern is not about ""bluf.""

If ""bluf"" always corresponds to the color of the word immediately before it, then in the sequence where ""bluf"" appears first (such a sequence is not provided in the examples), it would logically take the color of the word immediately following it, since there is no preceding color to mirror.

Therefore, the rule can be extended as follows: If ""bluf"" were to appear at the beginning of a sequence, we would look to the word immediately after it to determine its color.

bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word or the following word if there is no preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, each instance of the word ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Here's the rule breakdown:

- ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue."" The ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is blue, so ""walm"" results in repeated blue.

- ""lug walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue"" because ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which is blue and continues the blue color.

- ""lug dax walm"" translates to ""blue green green green."" The ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which is green, leading to repeated green.

- ""zup walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow"" since ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is assigned yellow, repeating the color yellow.

- ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" translates to ""red red green green red red red blue red."" The “walm” follows “wif” which is red, thus repeating the color red before ""lug"" which is blue and then followed by ""wif"" which reintroduces red.

Rule: walm -> the color of the word preceding it, repeated as many times as the instances of ""walm"" until a new color word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Rule: dax -> green

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output. Each occurrence of ""wif"" consistently results in ""red"" each time it appears in the input.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The term ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in every provided example.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be dependent on its position relative to other words.

Let's observe the pattern:

- In every instance, the output following ""bluf"" is ""green"" regardless of the context. This suggests a rule where ""bluf"" directly corresponds to ""green.""

Now, let's write the answer in the requested format:

Rule: bluf -> ""green.""
walm -> repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it takes the color associated with that word and repeats it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every given example.
To deduce the meaning or the rule for the word ""dax,"" we should look at the output pattern relative to its position and surrounding words in the input:

1. When ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the same position in the output.
2. No other word consistently corresponds to ""green"" across multiple inputs/outputs.

From these observations, we can induce that ""dax"" corresponds directly to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input list or surrounding context. Therefore, the rule can be formulated as:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". Each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output. Each other unique word in the input corresponds to a unique color in the output, repeating as many times as there are letters in the word. For example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and since ""zup"" has three letters, it is translated to ""yellow"" three times.

wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Every time the word 'zup' appears in the input, the output is 'yellow'.
To ascertain the meaning or rule for ""bluf,"" we must analyze the patterns in the provided examples and their corresponding outputs. Let's start by examining each instance where ""bluf"" appears:

1. Input: dax zup bluf  
   Output: green yellow yellow  
   * Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the last ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup bluf wif  
   Output: yellow yellow red  
   * Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow.""

3. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf  
   Output: yellow red green red red  
   * Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the last ""red.""

4. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax  
   Output: red red yellow red blue green  
   * Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red.""

5. Input: dax walm wif bluf  
   Output: green green green red red  
   * Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the first ""red.""

Looking at the patterns, ""bluf"" does not correspond to a consistent color in the output. Instead, it seems that the color output for ""bluf"" is dependent on the preceding word's output. If we inspect further, we notice that in every case, ""bluf"" has the same output color as the word that comes immediately before it:

1. Input: dax zup bluf  
   zup -> yellow, bluf -> yellow

2. Input: zup bluf wif  
   zup -> yellow, bluf -> yellow

3. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   wif -> red, bluf -> red

4. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
   wif -> red, bluf -> red

5. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   wif -> red, bluf -> red

Rule: bluf takes on the color output of the word that immediately precedes it.

Bluf -> meaning. Meaning: ""bluf"" results in an output color that matches the output color of the word before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to examine the relationship between the input and the output. It appears as though ""walm"" is responsible for the repetition of a color word corresponding to the input that precedes it. Each example has a unique color repeated three times, followed by a fourth color if there is a third input word. Here's the pattern:

- ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- ""dax walm wif"" produces ""green green green red.""
- ""zup walm lug"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow blue.""
- ""lug walm dax"" produces ""blue blue blue green.""
- ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red.""

From these examples, it looks like the word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times. The only time we see a fourth color is when there is a third word in the input sequence, which then produces the color associated with that third word.

The word preceding ""walm"" determines the color:
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Therefore, we can surmise that:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,123
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" we will look for patterns in the inputs and outputs:

1. Whenever ""lug"" appears, the color ""blue"" is always in the output.
2. No other input word correlates consistently with ""blue.""

From this observation, we can hypothesize that ""lug"" correlates with the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's look for patterns concerning the word and its relation to the output colors.

First example:
Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green

In this example, ""dax"" appears twice and corresponds to ""green"" both times. The pattern also suggests that ""wif"" correlates to ""red"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Second example:
Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red

Similarly, ""dax"" results in ""green"" every time. ""Zup"" is consistent with ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue."" ""Wif"" at the end is ""red,"" consistent with the first example.

Third example:
Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow

""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and ""walm"" seems to follow with another ""green,"" while ""wif"" aligns with ""red,"" consistent with previous examples, and ""zup"" with ""yellow.""

Fourth example:
Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow

Once more, ""dax"" is followed by ""green,"" and the other words' colors remain consistent with the previous examples.

Fifth example:
Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Following the pattern, ""walm"" should then lead to ""green,"" but instead, it results in additional ""blue"" colors.

From these examples, the clear rule for ""dax"" seems to be that it consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" is consistently mapped to the output ""red."" Thus, the rule is:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""red.""
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs. 

Let's observe the instances of ""bluf"" and their outputs consistently.

1. In every example, whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, so does the color mentioned in the output just before.
    - Example 1: ""dax bluf"" corresponds with ""green green""
    - Example 2: ""zup bluf"" corresponds with ""yellow yellow""
    - Example 4: ""zup bluf"" corresponds with ""yellow yellow""
    - Example 5: ""dax bluf"" corresponds with ""green green""

2. ""Bluf"" does not correspond with the same color—its output color changes depending on the word that appears before it.
    - In examples involving ""dax,"" ""bluf"" relates to green.
    - In examples involving ""zup,"" ""bluf"" relates to yellow.
    - When ""lug"" is used, ""bluf"" is not present, but ""lug"" is followed by the color blue in Example 3.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" seems to replicate the color mentioned in the output of the word immediately preceding it.

Therefore, we can infer the following rule for ""bluf"":

Bluf -> meaning: The word ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color associated with the previous word.""
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it three times, followed by the color associated with the word that follows it. Each input word corresponds to a specific color:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" appears to correspond to ""blue"" as well (assuming this is not a typo for ""lug""), or it might be that we don't have enough information about ""bluf"" to conclude its color, but it can be inferred from the last example. 

Given the examples:

- ""wif walm dax"" (red red red green) means ""red"" is repeated three times because ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and then ""green"" follows because ""dax"" comes after ""walm.""
- ""lug walm zup"" (blue blue blue yellow) means ""blue"" is repeated three times because ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and then ""yellow"" follows because ""zup"" comes after ""walm.""
- ""lug walm wif"" (blue blue blue red) means ""blue"" is repeated three times because ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and then ""red"" follows because ""wif"" comes after ""walm.""
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" (red red red blue blue) means ""red"" is repeated three times because ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and then ""blue"" is shown twice, once for ""lug"" and once for ""bluf."" Based on this we can assume ""bluf"" also means ""blue.""
- ""zup walm wif"" (yellow yellow yellow red) means ""yellow"" is repeated three times because ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and then ""red"" follows because ""wif"" comes after ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" three times, followed by the color corresponding to the word after ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word 'lug' corresponds to the color 'blue' in the outputs.
dax -> green. 

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in all given examples.
From the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Here's how this deduction lines up with the examples:

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green
""Wif"" translates to ""red"" and the other words translate to other respective colors.

Input: wif
Output: red
""Wif"" on its own yields the output ""red"".

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
Again, ""wif"" is the first word and its translation is ""red"".

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red
Here, ""wif"" is in the middle but still corresponds to the color ""red"".

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green
""Wif"" appears twice and in both occurrences, it corresponds to ""red"".

Rule:
wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

This rule is induced from the fact that every time the nonce word zup appears in an input, the output consistently includes the word ""yellow.""
Based on the examples given, we can induce the following rules for the meanings of certain words:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

From the way bluf appears to influence the output, we notice that bluf doesn't have a fixed color associated with it. Instead, it results in the repeating of the colors that correspond to the words immediately following it. 

Let's observe how bluf interacts with the words following it in each example:

1. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
2. Input: zup bluf wif walm (walm doesn't have an assigned color, it seems to be irrelevant) -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
3. Input: zup bluf dax -> Output: yellow yellow green
4. Input: wif zup bluf -> Output: red yellow yellow (note that bluf comes after the word zup here, which has repeated)
5. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax -> Output: blue green green red green (note that wif comes after bluf, causing red to repeat)

Rule:
bluf -> Causes the color(s) represented by the word(s) immediately following it to be repeated once.

Example deductions showing the rule at work:

- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"" because wif means red and bluf repeats the following word's color once.
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow red red red"" because zup means yellow, wif means red. Bluf repeats the colors of the words that follow (yellow and red); walm has no assigned color but could potentially be ""ignored"" as it has no effect.
- ""zup bluf dax"" results in ""yellow yellow green"" because zup means yellow, dax means green, and bluf causes the repetition of the following word's color (green).
- ""wif zup bluf"" results in ""red yellow yellow"" because wif means red, zup means yellow and bluf repeats the color yellow once (notice that ""wif"" doesn't repeat because bluf isn't immediately after it).
- ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" results in ""blue green green red green"" because lug means blue, dax means green, and bluf repeats the following colors of wif and dax (red, green). 

Thus, the rule for bluf is that it repeats the color output associated with the immediately subsequent word(s). If there are two words following bluf, it will repeat the sequence of colors associated with both words. If there's only one word, it will repeat the color associated with that word once.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's observe the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

Looking at the examples, every time the word ""walm"" appears in the input, the output contains a repetition of a color three times. For example:

- ""zup walm"" consistently results in ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""dax walm"" consistently results in ""green green green""

The repeated color corresponds to the color mentioned before ""walm."" Therefore, ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the previously mentioned color, three times.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""walm"" means to repeat the color mentioned just before the word ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug wif lug
    ",Output: green blue red blue,green blue red blue,True,125
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples given, it seems that each word corresponds to a color. The word ""lug"" is consistently associated with the color ""blue"":

- In the first example, ""lug"" appears twice and each time it is followed by the color ""blue"".
- In the second example, ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"" again.
- In both the third and fourth examples, ""lug"" appears on its own or followed by ""dax"" and results in ""blue"" with or without another color to follow.
- The fifth example also shows ""lug"" resulting in the color ""blue"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"". Each instance of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the output. Other words in the input correspond to different colors: ""lug"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""blue"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". 

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Every instance of ""zup"" in the input is translated to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the sequence or the words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each nonce word is directly translated to a color in the output. Mapping these translations we get:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

When following the pattern, ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color green in the output. Thus, the rule appears to be:

bluf -> green.
Based on the outputs corresponding to each input, the word ""walm"" seems to generate multiple outputs, specifically ""green"" repeated three times. The repeatability of the pattern in various contexts, with the term ""walm"" not varying in behavior in relation to different surrounding words, suggests a direct translation rather than a more complex rule.

Here are the observed instances:

1. ""dax lug walm"" generates ""green blue blue blue"", where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""walm"" appears to translate to ""blue blue blue"" given the three additional blues that appear in the output.

2. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"". Here, ""walm"" appears twice resulting in six 'green' outputs, ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""lug"" is ""blue"", which suggests that each ""walm"" results in ""green green green"".

3. ""wif dax lug walm"" leads to ""red green blue blue blue"", where ""wif"" is ""red"", ""dax"" is ""green"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and again, ""walm"" appears to translate to ""blue blue blue"".

4. ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" gives ""blue green yellow green green green red"", where ""walm"" again corresponds to ""green green green"", and all other words lead to a single color output.

5. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"". Here, since we know ""dax"" is green and there are three greens in the output, it can be inferred that ""walm"" generates the other two greens.

Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the word ""green"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:

Based on the provided examples and their associated outputs, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" Here is the reasoning:

Input: dax
Output: green
- Here, ""dax"" is the only word and the output is ""green.""

Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" while ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green.""

Input: lug dax
Output: blue green
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" comes out as ""green.""

Input: zup wif lug dax
Output: yellow red blue green
- Following the previous translations of ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug,"" ""dax"" remains consistent as ""green.""

Input: dax wif
Output: green red
- ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""

Given this consistent pattern in the examples, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence. It does not seem to be dependent on context as it consistently translates to ""red"" in each example.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning or rule for ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in the given examples where ""bluf"" is used and the corresponding output colors. Let's analyze the instances:

- Every instance of ""bluf"" in the input is paired with ""blue"" in the output.
- ""Bluf"" does not seem to be context-dependent since it translates consistently to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it.

Based on the examples provided:

Rule: bluf -> blue. Bluf consistently means blue regardless of the context within the given examples.
Rule: ""walm"" means repeating the color designated by the previously mentioned word. 

For example: 
- In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" thus ""walm"" corresponds to ""green green green,"" repeating the color associated with ""dax.""
- In ""zup walm wif,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

    Rules:

Rule: Whenever the word lug appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue.""
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green"" in the given examples.
Based on the input-output pairs provided, ""wif"" appears to be associated with a sequence of color outputs, specifically ""red."" Every occurrence of ""wif"" in the input corresponds with ""red"" in the output. Additionally, the output ""red"" is repeated once more than the number of repetitions of ""wif."" Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and also requires repeating the color ""red"" one additional time beyond its own occurrence.

Rule:
wif -> the word ""wif"" in the input results in as many ""red"" in the output as there are wif plus one.
Based on the given examples, 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow.' Every instance of 'zup' in the input leads to 'yellow' in the output, regardless of its position or surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
From the provided examples, we can infer a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by focusing on the output colors and their positions relative to the inputs:

1. Input: dax bluf wif lug
   Output: green green red blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" to red, and ""lug"" to blue.

2. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
   Output: yellow yellow red blue green
   - Here, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" to red, ""lug"" to blue, and ""dax"" to green.

3. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red
   - ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, and ""dax"" is green.

4. Input: lug bluf dax bluf
   Output: blue blue green green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""dax"" corresponds to green.

5. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""wif"" to red.

From these examples, when ""bluf"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is either red or green. It may not be immediately clear how to define ""bluf"" based on the first and last examples alone, but by examining the outputs related to ""bluf"" amongst all examples, we can note a pattern:

- The color red is only ever produced by the word ""wif"" or the word ""bluf.""
- The word ""bluf"" will output red if it is preceded by the word ""wif"" and green in all other cases.

Thus, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"" as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to red when immediately following ""wif,"" and corresponds to green otherwise.

So we can express the meaning of ""bluf"" as:

bluf -> meaning: ""red"" if preceded by ""wif,"" otherwise ""green"".
walm -> rule. Rule: The word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, repeated three times. For example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" while ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times because ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
dax -> green

Rule: Each instance of the nonce word 'dax' corresponds to the color 'green'.
Based on the examples provided:

- Every instance of ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
- It does not appear to change based on position in the sequence or due to the words around it.

Hence, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" consistently. Regardless of its position in the sequence, ""zup"" is always associated with the output ""yellow."" Therefore:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds with the color ""yellow.""
walm -> repeat the color mapped to the previous word. Rule: Repeat the color of the word before ""walm"" the number of times the word before ""walm"" is represented in color.

For each instance of ""walm"" in the examples, the color that appears immediately before it is repeated for as many times as that color is represented in the output. 

- In example one, ""dax walm"" is followed with ""green green green""; 'dax' is associated with the green color, and there are three greens after ""walm"".
- In example two, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"", with 'lug' being associated with the blue color.
- The third example intensifies this pattern with ""lug walm zup walm"" leading to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow""; this demonstrates that 'walm' repeats the color of the word before it.
- The fourth and fifth examples further support this rule.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color green in every example provided.
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> rule. Rule: The word bluf causes the color associated with the following word to be repeated. If there is no following word, the system does not output an additional color.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we must find a pattern in the examples provided:

1. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   
2. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   
3. Input: lug walm zup
   Output: blue blue blue yellow
   
4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

From the outputs associated with the inputs that contain ""walm,"" a pattern emerges. Each time ""walm"" is mentioned, multiple instances of the color that precedes it are repeated. Paying close attention, it seems that ""walm"" doubles the occurrence of the color word that precedes it. For example:

- In the first example, ""wif"" is associated with the color red, and after ""walm,"" we have ""red red red"" instead of just ""red.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, and after ""walm,"" we have two extra occurrences of ""blue,"" tallying to four instances of ""blue.""
- In the third example, the color blue (associated with ""lug"") is repeated thrice after ""walm.""
- In the fourth example, again, the color blue (associated with ""lug"") is repeated thrice after ""walm.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" is the word right before ""walm"" and is associated with the color blue. After ""walm,"" there are three instances of ""blue"" indicating that the appearance of ""lug"" is doubled.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:
Rule: walm -> repeats the preceding color word twice, effectively tripling that color's occurrence.

Based on this rule, ""walm"" can be seen as a nonce word that means to triple the immediate preceding color in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the patterns in the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Here's the rule deduced from the input-output pairs:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples given, we can try to deduce the rule by looking at the pattern of how ""dax"" is converted into a color in the output:

1. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
2. dax bluf -> green green
3. wif dax zup dax -> red green yellow green
4. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
5. lug dax -> blue green

When examining each instance, it seems that ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently correlates with the color ""yellow"". There is no change in output associated with ""zup"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding context. Therefore, the rule seems to be straightforward.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Given the examples:

Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
Input: zup lug zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
Input: wif dax bluf -> Output: red green green
Input: zup bluf dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow green blue

We can compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs to infer the meaning of the word ""bluf.""

A pattern emerges where each instance of ""bluf"" in the input results in a duplication of the color that precedes it in the output:

""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output includes a duplicate ""yellow.""
A similar deduction applies when ""bluf"" is in the context of other colors.

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it duplicates the color word that immediately precedes it in the output.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the preceding color.
Rule: ""walm"" refers to repeating the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times. 

In the examples given:
- ""zup wif walm"" yields ""yellow red red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""lug walm wif lug"" leads to ""blue blue blue red blue"" since ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" (blue) three times, followed by the color corresponding to ""wif"" (red), and then the color for ""lug"" again (blue).
- ""dax walm"" produces ""green green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- Finally, ""lug walm zup walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"" because ""walm"" repeats the color for ""lug"" (blue) and then repeats the color for ""zup"" (yellow).

Therefore:

walm -> Repeat the color of the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,131
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
In order to induce the rule for the word ""dax,"" let's look at the position of ""dax"" in each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   (""dax"" is followed by ""green"")

2. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
   (""dax"" is followed by ""green"")

3. Input: lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red
   (""dax"" is followed by ""green"")

4. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   (""dax"" is followed by ""green"")

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   (""dax"" is followed by ""green"")

Looking at the outputs corresponding to each input where ""dax"" is mentioned, the word ""dax"" is consistently followed by the color ""green"" in the outputs. Now we should also check if any other pattern applies to other parts of the inputs or if there's any counter-example where ""dax"" doesn't lead to ""green"", but there are none. Every occurrence of ""dax"" corresponds directly to ""green"" in the output sequence.

Therefore, the rule we can induce for ""dax"" is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""

Here are the examples with the translation applied:

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow
Explanation: The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red
Explanation: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds again to ""red.""

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow
Explanation: This is the same as the first example and follows the same translation.

Input: dax bluf wif lug
Output: green green red blue
Explanation: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" again (as it did in the second example), ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
Explanation: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> ""red""
zup -> yellow

Rule: In the given examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can look at the position of the word and the corresponding color output. Each example seems to pair the word before ""bluf"" with the color before ""red"" in the output. Here is what we can deduce:

1. ""dax bluf wif zup"" -> ""green green red yellow""
   - The word ""bluf"" follows ""dax""; ""green"" is in the position after the first ""green.""

2. ""lug bluf wif"" -> ""blue blue red""
   - The word ""bluf"" follows ""lug""; ""blue"" is in the position after the first ""blue.""

3. ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""
   - The word ""bluf"" follows ""wif""; ""red"" is in the position after ""green.""

4. ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""
   - The word ""bluf"" follows ""zup""; ""yellow"" is in the position after the first ""yellow.""

5. ""wif bluf zup"" -> ""red red yellow""
   - The word ""bluf"" follows ""wif""; ""red"" is in the position after the first ""red.""

Based on these examples, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" results in a repetition of the color corresponding to the word preceding it. If we were to assign a color directly to ""bluf,"" it wouldn't be consistent across the examples. Instead, ""bluf"" functions like a ""repeat"" command for the color code associated with the word before it.

Rule: *bluf* -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.
walm -> meaning. Based on the input and output examples provided, ""walm"" translates to the repetition of the color associated with the word just before it three times. 

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, it causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to be output three times. 

Example mapping: 
- ""zup"" means yellow, thus ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- ""dax"" means green, thus ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green.""
- ""lug"" means blue, but there's no instance of ""lug walm"" to confirm if it would lead to ""blue blue blue."" However, ""zup walm lug"" does result in ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" suggesting ""lug"" on its own simply means blue.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,132
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: ""lug"" -> blue
Based on the given examples, we can infer that ""dax"" maps to the color ""green."" Every instance where the word ""dax"" is used in the input, the color ""green"" is the corresponding output. Moreover, regardless of its position in the sequence of words, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" Here are the specific examples broken down:

- Example 1: ""dax"" is followed by ""green.""
- Example 2: The single word ""dax"" results in ""green.""
- Example 3: ""dax"" appears at the end of the sequence and is still followed by ""green.""
- Example 4: ""dax"" is at the beginning of the sequence and maps to ""green.""

The rest of the words (""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""walm,"" ""bluf"") yield different colors (yellow, blue, red), but ""dax"" consistently corresponds to green regardless of its position in the list or the other words present.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided:

""wif"" alone outputs ""red"".
When ""wif"" is combined with ""dax lug walm,"" it results in ""red green blue blue blue."" It seems that each word after ""wif"" adds one more color:
- ""dax"" -> ""green""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""walm"" -> ""blue blue""

In the third example, ""lug wif zup wif walm,"" the output sequence is ""blue red yellow red red red."" Here ""wif"" is preceded by ""lug"" and produces ""red"" (the same as when ""wif"" stands alone), and when ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" the result is ""yellow red,"" indicating that ""zup"" alone would correspond to ""yellow."" When ""wif"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""walm,"" it leads to ""red red red,"" which is consistent with ""walm"" being ""blue blue,"" with ""wif"" adding another ""red.""

In the fourth example, ""dax zup wif,"" the output is ""green yellow red,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" again results in ""red.""

In the fifth example, ""zup bluf wif dax lug,"" the output is ""yellow yellow red green blue,"" which demonstrates that ""wif"" retains its output ""red"" regardless of its position between ""bluf"" and ""dax,"" and it does not seem to be influenced by the presence of ""bluf.""

The rules deduced from these examples indicate that:
1. ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
2. The presence of other words does not appear to alter the meaning of ""wif.""
3. The meaning of ""wif"" appears to be independent of its position within the sequence of words.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present.
Rule: bluf -> yellow when preceding and/or following ""zup,"" green otherwise.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat the color that was generated by the word immediately preceding it. The number of repetitions corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned. To confirm and illustrate:

- In ""dax lug walm"", ""lug"" produces the color blue, and ""walm"" causes the color blue to be repeated an extra time, resulting in ""green blue blue blue"".
- In ""zup walm wif"", ""zup"" produces the color yellow, and ""walm"" causes the color yellow to be repeated multiple times, ending with ""wif"" changing the sequence with red, to result in ""yellow yellow yellow red"".
- In ""lug zup walm lug"", ""zup"" produces yellow, followed by ""walm"" which repeats the color yellow, before ""lug"" produces blue, resulting in ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"".
- In ""dax walm"", ""dax"" produces green and ""walm"" repeats the color green twice, for a total of three greens: ""green green green"".

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word multiple times, equal to the number of times ""walm"" appears in sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" 

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" is included in the output.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Thus, we can deduce that ""zup"" directly corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf -> the color word before bluf is repeated for the output. 

1. ""wif"" appears before ""bluf"" - ""red"" appears twice in the output.
2. ""wif"" is still before ""bluf"" despite ""zup"" being added to the beginning - ""red"" appears twice after ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"".
3. Here ""wif"" is before ""bluf"", but ""zup"" is now between them - only one ""red"" and two ""yellows"", likely influenced by ""zup"" but keeping in line with the rule that ""bluf"" repeats the color word before it.
4. ""wif"" is before ""bluf"" and ""zup"" follows ""bluf"" - output follows ""red red yellow"" reflecting the first color word is repeated twice due to ""bluf"" and ""zup"" adds a ""yellow"" at the end.
5. ""lug"" appears before ""bluf"" - ""blue"" appears twice in the output.

Based on the provided data, ""bluf"" prompts the repetition of the color word that appears directly before it in the input.
Based on the given examples, we can observe the following pattern:

- ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"" at both the beginning and the end, while ""zup walm"" in the middle corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- ""wif lug walm"" translates to ""red blue blue blue,"" with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" apparently adding two more ""blue"" at the end.
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" again contributing to two additional ""blue.""
- ""lug walm zup walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and each ""walm"" again contributing to two more colors matching the preceding single color.
- ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue green red blue red,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" adding two additional ""blue"" as seen previously.

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it adds two more of the color word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word preceding it two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Regardless of its position in the input string, ""lug"" always results in ""blue"" in the output sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of position or surrounding words. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that each input word corresponds to a particular color in the output. Let's analyze the patterns:

- In the first example, ""lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red red"". Since ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" in other examples, we can infer that ""lug"" likely corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- In the second example, ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green"". We already suspect ""wif"" means ""red"", which is reinforced by this example. It’s reasonable to assume ""dax"" means ""green"".
- In the third example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow red red red"". ""Bluf"" is again ""blue"" at the beginning, and since ""zup"" appears right before ""bluf"" and the output starts with ""yellow yellow"", we can infer that ""zup"" means ""yellow"". The repetition of ""red"" at the end indicates that ""walm"" might translate to two ""red""s as ""wif"" does to one.
- The fourth example, ""wif lug zup bluf"", becomes ""red blue yellow yellow"". We've seen ""lug"" as ""blue"", ""zup"" as ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" as ""blue"" in previous examples, which is consistent here, and ""wif"" remains ""red"".
- In the final example, ""wif dax wif"" results in ""red green red"". We've gathered that ""dax"" is ""green"", and since ""wif"" appears twice with ""red"" on each side of ""green"", it supports our conclusion that ""wif"" means ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in every example provided.
Based on the given examples where the nonce word ""bluf"" appears and its corresponding outputs in different contexts, we can induce the following rule:

Rule:
- The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

Examples:
1. In ""lug bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""bluf"" is also blue.
2. In ""dax bluf zup"", ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" is also green.
3. In ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"", the first ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" that corresponds to red, so ""bluf"" is red; the second ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" that corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" is green.
4. In ""lug zup bluf dax"", ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and corresponds to yellow, so ""bluf"" is also yellow.

Hence, the rule is:
bluf -> takes the color of the word immediately before it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns in the given examples.

- In the first example, ""zup walm dax"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow green."" Since ""zup"" on its own elsewhere translates to a singular ""yellow"" and ""dax"" translates to a singular ""green,"" it seems that ""walm"" is linked to the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it.
  
- In the second example, ""wif dax zup walm,"" the pattern ""red green yellow yellow yellow"" is seen. Here again, ""walm"" seems to follow the same rule of repeating the color linked to the preceding word.

- In the third example, ""wif walm dax zup,"" we get ""red red red green yellow."" ""walm"" follows the word ""wif,"" and the color ""red"" is repeated three times, suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it.

- In the fourth example, ""zup walm,"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" The presence of ""walm"" after ""zup"" again causes the ""yellow"" to be repeated.

- In the fifth example, ""dax walm,"" gives us ""green green green,"" reinforcing the idea that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color linked to the previous word.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug
    ",Output: green blue,green blue,True,135
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples given, ""lug"" appears to consistently map to ""blue."" There is no contextual variation in the meaning; ""lug"" always results in ""blue"" in the output regardless of its position or neighboring words.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input. Whether ""wif"" is at the beginning, middle, or end of the input sequence, or even stands alone, the output associated with it is ""red"". Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce a pattern for what ""zup"" represents in each sequence and compare it with other given words and their outputs. 

Looking at each sequence: 

1. ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" translates to ""green green red yellow red."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   
2. ""dax walm zup lug dax"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue green."" Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. ""zup dax zup"" translates to ""yellow green yellow."" Both places where ""zup"" appears, it corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow."" Once more, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

5. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" translates to ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red."" In this sequence, ""walm"" seems to have multiple outputs (yellow and red), complicating the pattern. However, ""zup"" continues to correspond to ""yellow.""

Given the consistency across all examples, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is straightforward.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, ""bluf"" seems to correspond to a repeated color. The color that is repeated matches the last color word mentioned before ""bluf."" Here's the rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" represents a repetition of the color word that appears immediately before it.
From the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat three times the color associated with the previous word.

Analyzing each example:

1. Input: wif walm  
   Output: red red red  
   Here, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and ""walm"" causes the output to repeat ""red"" three times.

2. Input: dax walm  
   Output: green green green  
   In this case, ""dax"" is associated with the color green, and following ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated three times.

3. Input: zup walm wif  
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red  
   ""zup"" appears to correlate with yellow, and ""walm"" again causes a triple repetition of ""yellow."" The subsequent ""wif"" results in a single instance of ""red.""

4. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif  
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red  
   ""lug"" is linked to blue, with ""walm"" causing a triple ""blue"" output. The pattern continues with ""dax"" leading to a single green, ""wif"" to red, and then ""lug"" and ""wif"" without ""walm"" lead to a single instance of their respective colors.

5. Input: dax walm lug  
   Output: green green green blue  
   ""dax"" links to green and is followed by ""walm,"" which causes green to be repeated thrice, and there is a single ""blue"" for the ""lug"" that follows without an associated ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output, irrespective of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce what ""dax"" means in this context, we can analyze the patterns and commonalities in the examples provided. Each example begins with ""dax,"" and the corresponding output always begins with ""green."" This consistent occurrence suggests that ""dax"" is directly related to the color ""green."" 

Now, let's consider the other words and their respective colors to determine if there is a one-to-one correspondence or if ""dax"" has an effect on the other words:

- lug consistently translates to ""blue,"" as seen in examples 1, 3, and 5.
- walm translates to ""blue blue"" when following ""lug dax lug"" in example 1 but translates to ""red"" when following ""wif"" in example 5. This indicates there may be an intervening rule or context dependency.
- wif consistently translates to ""red,"" seen in examples 2 and 5.
- zup consistently translates to ""yellow,"" as seen in examples 3 and 5.
- bluf translates to ""blue,"" seen in example 3.

Considering the above analysis, ""dax"" seems to directly correspond to ""green."" It appears as the first word in the input sequence, and the first color in the output sequence is always ""green"" when ""dax"" is present. There's no sign that ""dax"" modifies the meanings of the following words under the given examples. However, there may be an unwritten rule impacting when ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue"" or ""red,"" possibly dependent on its position or surrounding words.

Rule:
dax -> green

This rule means that ""dax"" represents the color ""green,"" and that association does not change regardless of context in the given examples.
Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a color. The word ""zup"" consistently leads to the output ""yellow"" regardless of its position within the input string or the words around it. Therefore, it would seem that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word that immediately precedes it.

1. In ""zup bluf dax,"" zup corresponds to yellow, and bluf takes on the color yellow, which corresponds to zup. So in this context, bluf -> yellow.

2. In ""lug wif bluf,"" wif corresponds to red, and bluf takes on the color red, which corresponds to wif. So in this context, bluf -> red.

3. In ""dax bluf,"" dax corresponds to green, and bluf also takes on the color green, which corresponds to dax. So here, bluf -> green.

4. In ""zup bluf lug dax lug,"" zup corresponds to yellow, so bluf takes on the color yellow. In the sequence ""lug dax lug,"" the color names do not change, and bluf is not present to potentially alter the pattern, suggesting that bluf only takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

5. In ""zup wif bluf,"" zup is yellow, but bluf is red, which comes from the color corresponding to wif. This further supports that bluf's color is derived from the word right before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it.
To figure out what ""walm"" means, let's look for patterns in the colors outputted in response to each example input.

- In the first input, ""dax zup walm wif,"" we see that the output associated with ""walm"" is three yellow followed by a red: ""yellow yellow yellow red."" However, ""zup"" which precedes it in the sequence, has an output of just one yellow. 
- In the second input, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" ""lug"" always corresponds to blue and ""zup"" to yellow, with ""wif"" corresponding to red. Directly associated with ""walm,"" we again see three blue followed by a red.
- In the third sequence, ""lug wif walm,"" we can see that ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red, and associated with ""walm"" are three red.
- The fourth input, ""dax lug wif walm,"" produces ""green blue red red red,"" where ""walm"" correlates with three consecutive reds following ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif.""
- The last example, ""lug walm,"" gives us ""blue blue blue,"" implying ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color for ""lug,"" which is blue.

It seems that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the preceding color three times, but if followed by ""wif,"" an additional red is added at the end. In other words, ""walm"" repeats the previous color three times and if ""wif"" follows ""walm"", add red at the end.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times. If followed by ""wif,"" add red at the end.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug
    ",Output: green blue,green blue,True,137
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug means ""repeat the color of the previous word."" If there is no previous word (as in the beginning of a sequence or after another ""lug""), it defaults to blue.
Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs provided.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in each example provided. Regardless of the context or the surrounding words, ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow.""
Given the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" acts as a repeater or duplicator for the preceding word's associated output. When ""bluf"" follows a word, the output for that word is duplicated. Now let's look at how this rule applies in each example:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"", suggesting that ""dax"" on its own would output ""green"", and ""bluf"" duplicates this output.
- In the second example, ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" becomes ""yellow red red yellow blue"". Here, ""wif"" must correspond to ""red"", and the presence of ""bluf"" following it duplicates the ""red"" output. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"", with ""bluf"" having no effect since it is not following those words.
- In the third example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"", which, given the rule deduced, indicates that ""bluf"" duplicates the output for ""wif"", which is ""red"".
- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf wif"" gives ""blue blue red"". The word ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"", and ""bluf"" again duplicates the previous output. ""wif"" follows with its own output of ""red"", unaffected by ""bluf"" since it comes after.
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm wif bluf"" outputs ""green green green red red"". Here, ""dax"" and ""walm"" both appear to correlate with the output ""green"", and ""wif"" with ""red"". ""Bluf"" duplicates the outputs for ""wif"".

The rule for ""bluf"" therefore seems to be: ""bluf"" duplicates the output of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the output of the preceding word.
Rule: walm -> repeats the last color mentioned multiple times (specifically three times, based on the provided examples).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to induce the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax."" Here is an analysis of each provided example in order to deduce the rule:

- In all instances where ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- ""Dax"" does not seem to be influenced by the position in the sequence, as it maintains the same output regardless of where it is placed.
- There is no clear pattern regarding the other words (wif, bluf, lug, zup) affecting the output of ""dax.""

Given this analysis, we can infer the following rule:

dax -> meaning. Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" irrespective of its position or surrounding words.
Rule: wif -> red.

This rule can be deduced because in every example where ""wif"" is present, the word ""red"" consistently appears in the output, regardless of its position or the other words around it.
Given the examples provided:

- In the first example, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""zup"" is still represented by ""yellow.""
- The third and subsequent examples continue to show ""zup"" resulting in ""yellow"" in the output.

For all examples provided, regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sentence, it consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output. There is no contextual variation noted that would modify the meaning of ""zup"" based on the surrounding words.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to take on the color of the word immediately preceding it. If there is no preceding word, as in the first example, it appears to default to ""green."" Let's verify this with the given examples:

1. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   Rule: ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which is green.

2. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   Rule: ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is red.

3. Input: zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow yellow red
   Rule: ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is yellow.

4. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red
   Rule: ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is red.

5. Input: zup lug bluf
   Output: yellow blue blue
   Rule: ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which is blue.

Notice that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word right before it. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> The word ""bluf"" represents the color of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the first word, it defaults to ""green.""
Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be:

Rule: lug means blue.
Based on the provided examples, each instance of a word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. Here is the mapping according to the examples given:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- bluf -> red
- zup -> yellow

It is important to note that the word ""bluf"" also corresponds to the color red, which is the same as ""wif."" This could either indicate a mistake in the examples or imply that different words can map to the same color.

Given the consistency across examples in which ""dax"" is always mapped to ""green,"" the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the input and output examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red. In each output instance, the presence of the word ""bluf"" in the input is directly translated to the word ""red"" in the output. The words ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""green"" respectively as seen in the patterns. Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> red.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word prior to ""walm."" To clarify, we can see the following pattern—when ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" the output is green repeated, and when it comes after ""lug,"" the output is blue repeated. 

Here is the reasoning in detail:

- ""dax walm zup lug dax"" results in ""green green green yellow blue green."" Immediately after ""walm,"" we have three greens, which corresponds to the fact that ""dax"" is before ""walm"" and associated with green.
  
- ""lug walm dax"" results in ""blue blue blue green."" The three blues correspond to the word ""lug,"" which comes before ""walm.""

- ""lug walm wif bluf"" results in ""blue blue blue red red."" Again, we have three consecutive blues after ""lug.""

- ""dax zup dax walm"" results in ""green yellow green green green."" Here, we have three greens following the last occurrence of ""dax"" which is just before ""walm.""

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" with blue being the color associated with ""lug.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times in the output sequence.

So the rule is:
walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output, irrespective of the other words in the input. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence. It is not dependent on context or adjacent words in the sequence. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""dax"" is consistent across all examples.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" translates consistently to ""red"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words surrounding it. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" means ""red"".
Based on the inputs and outputs provided, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" When we look at the pattern of colors in each output, every time the word ""zup"" is used in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output. 

Here is how ""zup"" fits within each example:

1. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   - wif -> red
   - lug -> blue
   - zup -> yellow
   - walm -> additional yellows

2. Input: zup dax wif zup
   Output: yellow green red yellow
   - zup -> yellow
   - dax -> green
   - wif -> red

3. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   - dax -> green
   - walm -> green (and following same color repeats)
   - zup -> yellow (change in color starts here)
   - lug -> blue (and following same color repeats)

4. Input: zup lug
   Output: yellow blue
   - zup -> yellow
   - lug -> blue

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   - wif -> red
   - zup -> yellow (next color is the same, as indicated by ""bluf"")
   - bluf -> indicates repetition of the previous color
   - lug -> blue
   - walm -> additional blues (repeats the color before it)

From this analysis, we can define the meaning of ""zup"" as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeat the color associated with the word preceding bluf. 

Rule: Each nonce word (dax, lug, zup, etc.) corresponds to a specific color (dax -> green, lug -> blue, zup -> yellow, etc.), and the presence of bluf indicates that the color of the word immediately before bluf should be repeated in the output.
Based on the examples given, ""walm"" appears to trigger a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word that immediately precedes it. In each example, the output is a repeated sequence of the color associated with the word before ""walm"". The quantity of repetition seems to be three times regardless of the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Hence, the rule seems to be:
walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: If X is the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""walm"", then ""walm"" means ""X X X"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each example.
Based on the provided examples, each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output, and these colors are consistent across examples. Here is the breakdown of the word-color associations:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> blue
- lug -> blue

In the examples where ""dax"" is present, the color ""green"" is consistently in the output at the same position where ""dax"" is in the input. This is the case regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the surrounding words. Therefore, ""dax"" directly translates to the color ""green.""

The rule can be stated as:
dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: Based on the provided examples, every instance where the word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red."" Therefore, the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
zup -> meaning: yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of the context in which it appears.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf"", let's look at the patterns in the examples provided:

1. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue
2. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
3. lug bluf -> blue blue
4. zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green green red
5. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green

Now let's analyze these examples to find the rule for ""bluf"":

- In examples 1 and 3, whenever ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", the color ""blue"" is repeated. It seems that ""bluf"" may mean ""repeat the previous color"".
- In example 2, ""bluf"" is followed after ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"", and the output is ""red"" repeated.
- In example 4, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"", the output is ""green"" repeated.
- Example 5 is similar to example 4, reinforcing the idea that ""bluf"" might mean to repeat the preceding color.

So the rule seems to be: ""bluf"" means repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> repeat the previous color.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to compare the inputs to their associated outputs, focusing on the position and context of ""walm"" within each sequence.

From the examples:

1. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green
2. zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green
3. dax walm wif dax -> green green green red green
4. zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow green blue
5. zup dax lug walm zup lug -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

We will analyze each instance of ""walm"" and its output. Here is a breakdown of each case:

1. In the first example, the word after ""walm"" is ""zup"" and the corresponding output is green. The position before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which also translates to green.
2. In the second example, ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" and the associated output is blue—the same color as ""walm"" itself.
3. In the third example, ""wif"" once again follows ""walm,"" and the output is green—the same color as ""walm.""
4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" which gives the output color yellow for both.
5. In the fifth example, ""zup"" follows ""walm,"" and both words yield the color blue.

If we look closely, we can note that in every instance, ""walm"" adopts the color of the word that follows it in the sequence. Let's confirm this pattern with the given examples:

1. green walm green (yellow blue green) – ""walm"" takes the color of the following word, ""zup"" (green).
2. yellow blue blue walm (blue red green) – ""walm"" takes the color of the following word, ""wif"" (blue).
3. green walm (green red green) – ""walm"" takes the color of the following word, ""wif"" (green).
4. yellow walm (yellow green blue) – ""walm"" takes the color of the following word, ""dax"" (yellow).
5. yellow green blue blue walm (blue yellow blue) – ""walm"" takes the color of the following word, ""zup"" (blue).

Based on this analysis, it seems ""walm"" is a chameleon word that changes to match the color of the word following it. So the rule is:

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the word that follows it in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug zup
    ",Output: green blue yellow,green blue yellow,True,142
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the position of the word dax in each input and the corresponding output:

- When ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""green blue.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" the output is ""green yellow.""
- When ""dax"" is followed before and after by ""zup,"" the output is ""green yellow green yellow.""
- When ""dax"" is at the beginning followed by ""bluf wif,"" the output is ""green green red.""
- When ""dax"" is at the beginning followed by ""lug zup,"" the output is ""green blue yellow.""
- When ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red green.""

In all cases, ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green,"" regardless of the words following or preceding it. Therefore, we can deduce that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Considering the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by examining the patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow""

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red

- ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""

Input: dax lug bluf wif
Output: green blue blue red

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Through these examples, we can consistently see that each time ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding place in the output. Moreover, the other words (""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""zup walm,"" and ""bluf"") correspond to other colors (""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""yellow""), but the word ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
The examples provided indicate that 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow.' Each time 'zup' appears in an input, 'yellow' appears in the corresponding output. There do not seem to be any contextual dependencies that alter the meaning of 'zup' in these examples.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns for each corresponding output:

1. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
2. ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green""
3. ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""
4. ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow blue yellow yellow""
5. ""lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue green green""

From these patterns, it looks like each word maps to a color, and ""bluf"" seems to take on the color of the word immediately preceding it:

- When ""wif"" (which maps to ""red"") precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is also ""red.""
- When ""lug"" (which maps to ""blue"") precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is also ""blue.""
- When ""dax"" (which maps to ""green"") precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is also ""green.""

Using this information, our rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word immediately before it in the sequence.
walm -> meaning. Meaning is to repeat the color that follows each instance of the word ""walm."" If ""walm"" precedes a color, that color is then repeated three times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is followed by a word that represents a color, repeat that color three times in the output. If ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence or isn't followed by a known color term, it results in a repetition of the color specified by the last color term mentioned before ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" correlates with the output ""green."" However, the other words in the input (""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""walm"") correlate with different color outputs. This suggests that ""dax"" does not have its meaning changed by the context and consistently translates to ""green.""

Here's the rule induction based on the pattern:

- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
- ""walm"" has been observed to correlate with ""blue""

Given these repeated patterns, the rule can be inferred as the following:

dax -> green

By extension, for each word appearing directly before ""dax,"" the derived rule regarding the output is:

- ""zup"" before ""dax"" gives ""yellow green""
- ""lug"" before ""dax"" gives ""blue green""
- ""wif"" before ""dax"" gives ""red green""

Each word, not just ""dax,"" seems to have a direct and consistent translation to a color in the output, with ""dax"" consistently mapping to ""green.""
Based on the given examples, there is a pattern where the nonce word ""wif"" is consistently translated to the word ""red"" in the output. Therefore, the rule that can be deduced is:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples given, each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. Here's the breakdown of the word-color correspondences from the examples:

- ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Since ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" in all the given examples, we can deduce the meaning of ""zup"":

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" correlates with the color ""yellow"" each time it is mentioned. Therefore, it appears that the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must look for patterns associated with ""walm"" and its corresponding output in each example. From the inputs and outputs provided, we gather the following:

Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green
- Here walm follows zup and the output for walm is yellow, which is the same as the output for zup.

Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red
- In this instance, walm follows the second dax and the output for walm is green, which is the same as the output for the dax that comes right before it.

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
- walm follows wif here and the output for walm is red, matching the output for wif.

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red
- walm here also follows zup and has the same output color: yellow.

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
- In this case, walm comes after lug and the color for both is blue.

Based on these observations, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" assumes the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Hence, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes on the output value (color) of the word directly before it in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> meaning. walm takes the same output color as the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Rule: dax -> green

When ""dax"" is present alone, the output is consistently ""green"". There is no variation in this pattern across the given examples.

When ""dax"" is present with ""wif"", the output is ""green red"", suggesting that ""wif"" correlates with the output ""red"" when it follows ""dax"". However, there aren't examples provided to define the meaning of ""wif"" alone. The rule for ""dax"" can be confirmed based on the provided data, but the rule for ""wif"" would require additional examples to verify.
Based on the given examples, we can observe the following:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears after ""lug,"" the output is ""red"" following ""blue."" (e.g., ""lug wif"" -> ""blue red"")
- Whenever ""wif"" appears before ""lug,"" the output is ""red"" before ""blue."" (e.g., ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue"")
- When ""wif"" stands alone, it is translated directly to ""red."" (e.g., ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue"")
- ""wif"" can appear more than once and is still translated to ""red"" each time. (e.g., ""lug walm wif zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue red yellow red"")

Thus, we can conclude that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color that is one position before ""wif"" in the output sequence, regardless of its position in the input sequence. It is important to note that ""bluf"" always results in ""red"" in the output, and ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" as well.

Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
Output: green green red yellow blue
- Here, ""bluf"" precedes ""wif"" and both map to ""red"" in the output.

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
- ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""red,"" the same color as ""wif.""

Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
Output: yellow red red yellow blue
- ""bluf"" produces ""red,"" following the pattern where it matches the color associated with ""wif.""

Input: lug walm wif bluf
Output: blue blue blue red red
- In this input, ""bluf"" again matches the output color ""red"" of ""wif.""

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- Similarly, ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" which is the color that would precede ""wif"" in the output.

By examining the patterns and the corresponding outputs, it can be concluded that ""bluf"" represents the same color as ""wif"" in the output, which is ""red"".

Rule: bluf -> the same color as ""wif"" in the output; in provided cases, this color is ""red"".
From the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. Let's look at the examples to see how this works:

- In the first example, ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow."" Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" seems to cause the repetition of ""yellow"" twice more.

- In the second example, again ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow,"" further supporting the initial observation.

- In the third example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" translates to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" Note that after the second ""zup,"" ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat two more times.

- In the fourth example, ""lug walm wif zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red yellow red."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to repeat twice more.

- In the fifth example, ""zup dax walm"" translates to ""yellow green green green."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes ""green"" to repeat two more times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the word before it to repeat two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each given example, irrespective of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word consistently translates to a specific color in the output. The word ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"", regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Regardless of context within the given examples, whenever the word ""zup"" is present in the input, the output is ""yellow"".
Rule: Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color red.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to cause the color output sequence to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Here is the rule induction for each input:

- In the first example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times, which is the color associated with ""zup.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times, which is the color associated with ""lug.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and after ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times, which is associated with ""dax.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated twice.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated two times.

Thus, the rule seems to be as follows:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

So the meaning can be articulated as:

walm -> causes repetition of the previous color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word lug corresponds to the color blue across all the examples given.
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the word ""red"". Each time ""wif"" is presented in the input, the output is ""red"", regardless of the presence of other words.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> ""yellow""

Each time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the output corresponds with the word ""yellow"". The number of repetitions of ""yellow"" is determined by the word that follows ""zup"" (e.g., ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three times). However, we do not have enough examples to fully deduce the pattern for how the subsequent word determines the number of repeats of ""yellow"". ""Lug"" follows ""zup"" once and results in a single ""yellow"", suggesting that different words following ""zup"" may dictate the number of ""yellow"" outputs.
bluf -> blue

Rule: The word 'bluf' translates to the color blue regardless of its position or the context within the examples provided.
Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" appears to be associated with a repetition of the color word that precedes it. Each time ""walm"" is used, the color word that comes directly before it is repeated multiple times in the output.

For example:
- ""dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue blue blue"", where ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue"") is repeated three times after it appears once, making four instances of ""blue"" in a row.
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"", where ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow"") is repeated twice after it appears once, making three instances of ""yellow"" in a row.
- ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" shows that ""dax"" (which translates to ""green"") is repeated four times in a row, followed by the color for ""wif"" (which translates to ""red"").

From this pattern, we can induce that ""walm"" indicates that the color of the word immediately before it is to be repeated three additional times, totalling four consecutive mentions of that color. If ""lug"" means blue, ""lug walm"" would translate to ""blue blue blue blue"".

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" prompts the repetition of the preceding color word three additional times, resulting in four consecutive instances of the same color word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue."" Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in each example it appears.
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, zup consistently corresponds to the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> blue

Rule: Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each instance regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns of the colors associated with each word in the examples provided:

- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug"" first corresponds to ""blue,"" and when used with ""walm,"" all outputs are ""blue.""
- ""dax"" first corresponds to ""green,"" and when used with ""walm,"" all outputs are ""green.""

Now, focusing on the word ""walm"" and its effect on the output:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup wif"" (Input: ""zup wif walm""), the output is ""yellow red red red."" Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" we might infer that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax wif"" (Input: ""dax wif walm""), the output is ""green red red red."" This supports the previous inference since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" but ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"" is immediately before ""walm,"" causing the repetition of ""red.""
- When ""walm"" is preceded and followed by ""lug"" (Input: ""lug walm dax""), the outputs are ""blue blue blue green."" The presence of ""walm"" between two occurrences of ""lug"" results in ""blue"" being repeated in place of ""walm."" Still consistent with our earlier deduction.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup wif"" again (Input: ""zup wif walm""), we see the same output as the first time: ""yellow red red red,"" reinforcing the idea.
- Finally, when ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug dax"" (Input: ""lug dax walm""), the output is ""blue green green green."" This again aligns with our rule since the color associated with ""dax"" (green) is repeated after ""walm,"" indicating that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color related to the word immediately preceding it.

Given this consistent pattern, we can induce the following rule:

walm -> causes a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Considering the given examples:

Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

Input: wif
Output: red

Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow

Analyzing these examples, we can infer that each time the word ‘wif’ is used, the word 'red' follows. We don't have enough context to discern a more complex rule about the nonce word 'wif,' such as its relationship with subsequent or preceding words. Therefore, the best rule we can induce from these examples is:

Rule: wif -> red
The word ""zup"" seems to correspond to the color ""yellow"".

Let's verify this according to the given examples:

1. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" at the start and end.
   - ""zup"" corresponds to the first occurrence of ""yellow"".
   - ""walm"" corresponds to subsequent occurrences of ""yellow"".
   
2. Input: zup lug zup dax
   Output: yellow blue yellow green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to both occurrences of ""yellow"".
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

3. Input: dax zup wif zup
   Output: green yellow red yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
   - ""zup"" corresponds to the first and last ""yellow"".
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

4. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""lug"" corresponds to the first ""blue"".
   - ""walm"" corresponds to subsequent occurrences of ""blue"".
   - ""wif"" corresponds to all occurrences of ""red"" after it.

5. Input: wif bluf zup
   Output: red red yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to the double occurrence of ""red"".
   - ""bluf"" seems to be a non-indicative component in this context and should likely be considered as noise.
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

From the examples, we can deduce that irrespective of its position or the order of other nonce words, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"". 

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color that corresponds to the color of the previous word in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the first word in the sequence or follows a word that has no assigned color, there is not enough information to determine its color.

Examples supporting the rule:

- ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue red red blue red."" Here, the word ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red""; therefore, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red.""

- ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green""; therefore, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green.""

- ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" corresponds to ""yellow green green yellow green."" ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green""; therefore, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green.""

- ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" corresponds to ""blue red green green red blue."" The first ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green""; therefore, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green.""

- ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red""; therefore, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red.""

Thus, based on the provided examples:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is the color associated with the word that comes before it in the sequence. If there is no preceding word or the preceding word does not have an associated color, then the meaning of ""bluf"" cannot be determined without additional context.
Analyzing the pattern between the inputs and outputs, we can observe the following:

1. The word ""walm"" always appears at least once in the input.

2. When it appears, the output has a series of colors that are the same and equal in number to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

3. The color that appears in repetition corresponds to the word that precedes ""walm"" in the input sequence. For instance:
   - In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", and the output is ""red red red red"" which corresponds to ""wif"" being red.
   - In the second example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" which corresponds to the color green, and the output is ""green green green green green"". The number of greens corresponds to the position of ""walm"" (the fifth word).

By examining the inputs and outputs, it can be inferred that ""walm"" has a pattern of representing a repetition of the color associated with the previous word in a quantity that matches the position of ""walm"" in the input.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word n times, where n is the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in all of the given examples, regardless of the words that precede or follow it.
Analyzing the examples provided:

1. Input: wif dax

2. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
   
3. Input: dax lug zup dax

4. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   
5. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue

From these examples, we can observe the following:

- The word ""dax"" always results in the output ""green"", regardless of its position in the input sequence.
- The other words, such as ""wif"", ""lug"", ""zup"", ""walm"", etc., correspond to different colors: ""wif"" -> red, ""lug"" -> blue, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""walm"" -> green.
- The position of ""dax"" relative to these other words alters the sequence order of the colored outputs but doesn't change the fact that ""dax"" translates to ""green"".

Therefore, we can deduce the rule for ""dax"":

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that wif corresponds to the color red in all instances. No matter what position the word ""wif"" appears in the sequence, the output is consistently ""red"". Moreover, there seems to be no dependency on the context or surrounding words to change the meaning of ""wif"". Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the immediately preceding word.
To figure out the rule for ""walm,"" we need to look at the positions and repetitions of words both in the input and their corresponding output colors. Here's an analysis of each example:

1. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
   - ""dax"" correlates with the first ""green""
   - ""walm"" correlates with the next two ""green""
   - ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""

2. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
   - ""lug"" correlates with the first ""blue""
   - ""walm"" correlates with the next two ""blue""
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" correlates with ""red""

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" correlates with the first ""green""
   - ""walm"" correlates with the next two ""green""

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" correlates with the first ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" correlates with the next two ""yellow""

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" correlates with the first ""green""
   - ""walm"" correlates with the next two ""green""

Based on the above observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it duplicates the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: walm -> meaning. Walm duplicates the color associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" by looking at the corresponding output in each case. Here are the occurrences of ""lug"" with their outputs:

1. dax lug bluf wif -> green blue blue red
2. lug walm zup -> blue blue blue yellow
3. wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue
4. lug dax lug wif -> blue green blue red
5. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue

It seems every time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" is the corresponding output. With this consistent pattern, we can deduce:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" consistently in every given example, regardless of the position or the other words surrounding it.
Rule: bluf translates to the word ""blue"" in the examples provided. The color associated with the other nonce words seems consistent regardless of the position in the sequence, while ""bluf"" is associated with the color blue each time it appears. 

bluf -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""walm"" results in the output color being repeated three times in secession. To validate this, let's analyze each example.

1. For ""wif walm zup walm"", the output is ""red red red yellow yellow yellow"". 
   - ""wif"" translates to a single ""red"".
   - Following ""walm"", there are three ""red"" which suggests that ""walm"" is related to the previous word, ""wif"", being repeated three times.
   - ""zup"" then translates to a single ""yellow"".
   - Following the second ""walm"", we again see ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

2. For ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"", the output is ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red"".
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"".
   - After ""zup walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated three times, as with the first example.
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green"", followed by ""wif"" which translates into ""red"" twice.

3. ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"".
   - The word ""dax"" correlates with ""green"".
   - After ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated three times.

4. ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red"".
   - The word ""wif"" correlates with ""red"".
   - After ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated three times, as before.

5. ""dax walm wif"" outputs ""green green green red"".
   - As before, ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" and is repeated three times after ""walm"".
   - ""wif"" is separate and correlates with a single ""red"".

If we consider ""walm"" to act on the word that precedes it, causing the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times, the evidence from the examples provided supports this rule.

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the directly preceding word to be output three times.
- walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" is associated with the color green, regardless of its position in the sentence or the context. Every time ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output. Therefore, we can deduce a rule for the meaning of ""dax"":

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, each instance of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output. Regardless of the position of ""wif"" within the input sequence or the other words around it, the output consistently includes ""red"" wherever ""wif"" appears.

The rule is, therefore:

wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
Rule: bluf -> repeated color of the previous word. 

This rule is inferred because in each instance bluf copies the color associated with the word immediately before it. For example, in ""dax bluf wif zup lug"", ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" following it also corresponds to green. In another example, ""lug wif bluf lug wif"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue, followed by ""bluf"" which also corresponds to blue.
Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word.

Explanation: In all the examples, the color sequence for ""walm"" is a repetition of the color assigned to the previous word.

- Example 1: dax walm wif zup. Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""walm"" here also corresponds to ""green"".
- Example 2: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf. Here ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""walm"" also gives ""yellow"".
- Example 3: lug zup walm lug. ""Walm"" follows ""zup"" with ""yellow"", hence ""walm"" also corresponds to ""yellow"".
- Example 4: zup walm. ""Walm"" directly follows ""zup"", which is ""yellow"", thus ""walm"" equals ""yellow"".
- Example 5: zup wif walm. ""Walm"" follows ""wif"", which is ""red"", so ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"".

Therefore: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word.

1. When ""wif"" appears before ""dax,"" the output is ""red green.""
2. When ""zup"" appears before ""dax,"" the output is ""yellow green.""
3. When ""dax"" appears before ""zup,"" the output for ""dax"" remains ""green.""
4. When ""dax"" appears before ""wif,"" the output for ""dax"" remains ""green.""
5. ""dax"" always results in ""green,"" regardless of its position or the words surrounding it.

From the examples given, it appears that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence and the adjacent words.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output.

Therefore, the rule is: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow"".
bluf -> the same color as the preceding word. Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another word, it takes on the color associated with that word.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we'll analyze how the output changes in the presence of this word within the provided examples. Let's look at each input and the corresponding output step by step.

1. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

With ""zup"" correlating to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" correlating to ""blue,"" the word ""walm"" in between the repetitions of ""yellow"" suggests that ""walm"" also translates to ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

Here, we see ""wif"" translates to ""red."" ""Zup"" continues to translate to ""yellow,"" but now we have two ""yellow"" at the end corresponding to ""zup"" and ""walm,"" reinforcing that ""walm"" might indeed mean ""yellow.""

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

Again ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and with the input ending with ""walm"" and the output ending with ""red,"" it suggests that ""walm"" could mean ""red"" in this context. However, this conflicts with previous examples.

4. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

Here ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""red,"" and since ""walm"" and ""dax"" precede three occurrences of ""green,"" ""walm"" could mean ""green"" in this context. But again, this conflicts with the idea that ""walm"" means ""yellow.""

5. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red

This reinforces the correlation of ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" with ""red."" Since ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes two additional ""green"" in the output, it could imply ""walm"" means ""green"" here.

By comparing all examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" does not have a fixed color associated with it. Instead, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that precedes it. 

So, based on the analysis:

Rule: ""walm"" assumes the color of the word immediately before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow blue blue blue,yellow yellow blue blue blue,True,153
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each of the given examples.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce that each nonce word translates to a specific color in English. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input string. Therefore, we can deduce the meaning as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, one might deduce that ""wif"" is associated with the color red. This is evident because whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the color red appears in the output, regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the sequence.

Here is the breakdown of the occurrences:
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue, as seen in the outputs when ""lug"" appears.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, based on its occurrence.
- ""walm"" is not as clear from a single example but seems to result in a repetition of red based on “zup wif walm” translating to “yellow red red red”.

Given that each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output, and it maintains this correspondence regardless of its position or the presence of other words, we can hypothesize:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, the rule can be inferred as follows:

zup -> yellow

Every instance of the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" will appear in the output at the position corresponding to the position of ""zup"" in the input. If ""zup"" is the only word in the input, the output is simply ""yellow"".
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to represent a color and takes on the color value of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> Takes on the color value of the preceding word.

- In ""zup wif dax wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" takes the color value of ""dax,"" thus ""bluf"" is red.
- In ""dax bluf,"" ""bluf"" takes the color value of ""dax,"" thus ""bluf"" is green.
- In ""zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" takes the color value of ""zup,"" thus ""bluf"" is yellow.
- In ""dax bluf zup bluf dax,"" ""bluf"" first takes the value of ""dax"" (green), then takes the value of ""zup"" (yellow), and does not change the color of the following ""dax"" (green).
- In ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" ""bluf"" first takes the color value of ""lug"" (blue), then does not affect the colors following it.
walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the word before it three times.

Rule: If a word precedes ""walm,"" output the color associated with that preceding word three times. If ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, there is no repetition of a color after ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

    ",Output: green yellow green blue green,green yellow green blue green,True,154
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds with the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is used in the Input, ""red"" is included at that position in the Output.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output includes the word ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Rule: bluf -> duplicate the color associated with the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the provided examples, let's look at the patterns of the colors associated with each instance:

1. In the first example, the pattern of colors is blue, blue, blue, yellow, red. Here, ""lug"" and ""zup"" appear both preceding ""walm,"" and they are both translated to blue.

2. In the second example, the pattern is yellow, yellow, yellow, blue, red, red. ""Zup"" appears before ""walm"" again, and it is still yellow. ""Walm"" follows ""zup"" again and is yellow, but there are two reds at the end because ""bluf"" seems to translate to red and it's repeated.

3. In the third example, the pattern is just green, green, green. ""Dax"" precedes ""walm"" and they both translate to green.

4. In the fourth example, the pattern is yellow, red, red, red, blue, where ""lug"" is at the end this time, and ""walm"" follows ""wif"" instead of ""zup"".

5. In the fifth example, the pattern is red, red, red, green, yellow. Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" again, translating to red.

From the above, the colors corresponding to ""walm"" are blue, yellow, green, red. It's not entirely clear what ""walm"" translates to individually, but we can infer from the examples that ""walm"" causes repetition of the previous word's color translation, but the number of repetitions is consistent with the position of ""walm"" in the series:

1. ""lug walm zup"" resulted in three blues because ""walm"" was the second word.
2. ""zup walm lug"" yielded three yellows because ""walm"" was again the second word.
3. ""dax walm"" led to three greens with ""walm"" as the second word again.
4. ""wif walm lug"" translated to three reds because ""walm"" was in the second position after ""wif"". 
5. ""wif walm dax zup"" again led to three red repeatings because ""walm"" was the second word after ""wif"".

Hence, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color of the word just before it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding word's color translation to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,155
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""lug"" correlates to the color blue. Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" is an indicator for the color green. Every time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Here's the breakdown according to the examples:

- ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""
- ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""
- ""lug dax wif"" -> ""blue green red""
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
- ""dax bluf wif zup"" -> ""green green red yellow""

In all cases, whenever ""dax"" is present, the output reflects ""green"" in the exact position. It doesn't seem to affect the surrounding words and what they correspond to (which appears to be another set of rules).

Rule: dax -> ""green""
wif -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the meaning of ""wif"" appears to be associated with the color ""red."" Each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the output. 

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" seems to translate to the color ""yellow"" in each instance. It doesn't appear to change meaning based on context, position, or surrounding words. It consistently correlates with the output ""yellow"" in every given example. 

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to compare the input strings with their corresponding outputs, looking for patterns that would help us associate ""bluf"" with an output color or a sequence of colors.

Let's analyze the data:

1. Input: zup wif bluf | Output: yellow red red
   - The word ""wif"" corresponds to red.
   - The word ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - Since ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red red,"" there is a possibility that ""bluf"" means ""red"" or it repeats the color of the preceding word.

2. Input: wif walm lug bluf | Output: red red red blue blue
   - ""walm"" and ""lug"" don't appear in the first example, so we need to focus on ""wif"" and ""bluf.""
   - ""wif"" still corresponds to red, and now ""bluf"" is followed by not one but two instances of blue. This suggests that ""bluf"" might mean ""blue"" but also seems to duplicate the color that follows.

3. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax | Output: green green red yellow green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which we know is red, but the output is green again, suggesting either that ""bluf"" means ""green"" or that it duplicates the color of the preceding word.

4. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug | Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
   - ""bluf"" comes after a ""zup"" (yellow) and its corresponding output color is yellow again.

5. Input: wif zup bluf | Output: red yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and the output color is yellow again.

By analyzing the inputs and their outputs, the pattern seems to be that the color associated with ""bluf"" is a repetition of the color associated with the word right before it. Therefore, the rule we can deduce for ""bluf"" is: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color of the preceding word.
From the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" consistently translates to ""red red red"" regardless of its position within the input sequence. It does not appear to depend on the words that come before or after it. However, the examples also imply a pattern or rule for the other words: ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" 

The word ""dax"" appears only once and is followed by green output, which can be assumed to correspond to ""dax."" However, without additional examples, we cannot definitively conclude the rule for ""dax.""

Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be:

walm -> red red red

Meaning that ""walm"" is equivalent to three consecutive ""red"" outputs.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,156
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue.

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in every provided example.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output. It does not seem to change regardless of position or surrounding words. Hence, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's examine each input and its corresponding output closely:

1. **dax wif walm** -> green red red red
   - The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - The word ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red.""

2. **zup lug zup wif dax** -> yellow blue yellow red green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

3. **wif** -> red
   - Only ""wif"" is present and the output is solely ""red.""

4. **zup bluf wif walm** -> yellow yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""bluf"" is likely corresponding to ""yellow.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red.""

5. **dax wif zup dax** -> green red yellow green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

From the output of each of these inputs, it consistently shows that the word ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red."" Every time ""wif"" is in the input, ""red"" is in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to a repeated color based on a preceding word. Specifically, it mirrors the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

- In ""dax zup bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""bluf"" takes on the color yellow.
- In ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf,"" ""wif"" precedes the first ""bluf"" and corresponds to red, so the first ""bluf"" is red. The second ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which correlates to blue, so the second ""bluf"" is blue.
- ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" shows that ""dax"" correlates to green, so when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it is green.
- In ""zup bluf,"" the word ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, resulting in ""bluf"" also being yellow.
- Likewise, in ""wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, so ""bluf"" is red.

Therefore:
bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color of the word that precedes it.
Based on the examples provided, the term ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repeated output color that is associated with the word immediately preceding it in the input. Here is the breakdown of the examples given:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" Since the word ""lug,"" which precedes ""walm,"" corresponds to the color blue, ""walm"" results in repeating that color.
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green."" ""Dax,"" which precedes ""walm,"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" repeats the color affiliated with ""dax.""
- The third example, ""dax lug walm,"" outputs ""green blue blue blue."" The last word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to ""lug.""
- The fourth example is the same as the first one, with ""lug walm"" giving ""blue blue blue.""
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" produces ""red red green green green."" ""Dax"" is the word preceding ""walm,"" corresponding to the color green, and ""walm"" repeats that color.

Therefore, ""walm"" functions as a rule to repeat the color of the word that precedes it three times. The rule for ""walm"" is that it takes the color associated with the immediately preceding word and repeats it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:

Rule: The word ""lug"" in the context given translates to the color ""blue"". Each instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: Every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green.""
wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Let's verify this with the given examples.

- Input: dax zup lug wif zup
  Output: green yellow blue red yellow
  Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in two instances.

- Input: zup wif bluf zup
  Output: yellow red red yellow
  Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in two instances.

- Input: zup wif walm lug
  Output: yellow red red red blue
  Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" once at the beginning.

- Input: dax zup bluf
  Output: green yellow yellow
  Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" once, matching the pattern.

- Input: dax lug zup
  Output: green blue yellow
  And in the last example, ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow.""

All the provided instances support the deduction that ""zup"" consistently translates to the word ""yellow."" There is no indication that the meaning of ""zup"" depends on the context; it is always associated with the same output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf -> blue
Rule: The word ""walm"" means to repeat the color word corresponding to the word before it three times. 

- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" hence ""walm"" means repeating ""blue"" three times.
- ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" thus ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""red"" three times.
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"" because ""dax"" equals ""green,"" so ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times.

Therefore: walm -> repeat the previous color word three times

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" appears to be the color ""blue.""

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the outputs provided.
From the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

1. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"": Since ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" which corresponds to a repeated color ""red"", ""wif"" could mean ""red"" in this context.
2. ""lug zup wif lug"" -> ""blue yellow red blue"": ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"" and is translated to ""red"", so it seems ""wif"" consistently means ""red.""
3. ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> ""red red red blue blue"": ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and after translation, we see ""wif"" as ""red"" again. ""walm"" and ""lug"" both translate to ""red"" and ""bluf"" to ""blue"". ""wif"" seems to retain the meaning of ""red"", regardless of what follows.
4. ""dax zup wif zup"" -> ""green yellow red yellow"": ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"". ""wif"" here is again followed by ""zup"" and translates to ""red"". This supports the idea that ""wif"" means ""red"".
5. ""dax wif"" -> ""green red"": With ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"", ""wif"" independently translates to ""red"".

Rule: wif -> ""red"".
Based on the given examples, each instance of the word ""zup"" correlates directly with the color ""yellow"" in the output. No matter the position of ""zup"" within the input sequence, the output consistently translates ""zup"" to ""yellow"". Therefore, the rule can be concluded as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples you have provided, the word bluf corresponds to a color that is repeated twice in the output. The color it represents appears to be determined by the word that comes directly before it:

- When bluf follows zup, the output is ""yellow yellow"".
- When bluf follows dax, the output is ""green green"".
- When bluf follows wif, the output is ""red red"".

It seems that bluf takes the color associated with the preceding word and duplicates it in the output. Therefore, the rule for bluf appears to be that it repeats the color associated with the previous word twice.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word two times.
walm -> meaning. The word ""walm"" seems to induce a repetition of the color word that precedes it in the pattern of three. The first word determines the pattern for the following colors.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word, the output is that color word repeated three times. When preceded by ""lug,"" ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" When preceded by ""dax,"" ""walm"" results in ""green green green."" When preceded by ""zup,"" ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" If ""walm"" is proceeded by combinations of color-indicating words, such as ""dax lug,"" it seems to only take the immediate predecessor into account, not the entire sequence; hence ""blue blue blue"" is the output for ""lug walm,"" regardless of other colors that are mentioned before ""lug.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the following pattern can be identified for the nonce word ""lug"":

- In every output sequence where ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Here are the appearances of ""lug"" and their corresponding outputs to solidify the rule:

- Example 1: ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow"".
- Example 2: ""wif lug"" becomes ""red blue"".
- Example 3: ""lug wif lug wif lug"" becomes ""blue red blue red blue"".
- Example 4: ""lug"" alone becomes ""blue"".
- Example 5: ""dax bluf lug wif"" becomes ""green green blue red"".

No matter the context in the input, ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green. Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the outputs provided. Every time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""green"" is included in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Each time ""wif"" is presented in the input, ""red"" appears in the output in the same position relative to the other words.

Hence, the rule can be stated as:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples.
Based on the input-output pairs given, we need to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" We can start by looking for patterns in the examples provided.

Let's analyze the output each time ""bluf"" is present:

- When ""wif bluf"" is the input, the output is ""red red.""
- When ""wif bluf dax lug"" is the input, the output is ""red red green blue.""
- When ""lug wif bluf"" is the input, the output is ""blue red red.""
- When ""dax bluf wif lug"" is the input, the output is ""green green red blue.""
- When ""dax zup bluf"" is the input, the output is ""green yellow yellow.""

Considering ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" we can start to deduce the potential meaning of ""bluf."" 

Observing where ""bluf"" appears, the color following its occurrence (except for the first example which seems to be a special case where the word ""bluf"" is repeated) is the same as the color assigned to the word that appears immediately before ""bluf"": 

- In ""wif bluf dax lug,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""green,"" the same as ""dax.""
- In ""lug wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""red,"" the same as ""wif.""
- In ""dax bluf wif lug,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""red,"" the same as ""wif.""
- In ""dax zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow,"" which is a new color assigned to ""zup.""

Based on this pattern, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it in the output sequence. However, when ""bluf"" is the second word and follows ""wif,"" as in the first input, it isn't followed by another color, so it just repeats the color associated with ""wif."" This exception suggests that ""bluf"" might act as a repeater of the color associated with the previous word, but without another word, it cannot take a new color, so it defaults to the same color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the previous word (or, if followed by the same word like ""wif,"" it repeats that color).
Walm -> meaning. Examining the examples provided, ""walm"" correlates with repeated output of the color immediately preceding it in the input. Thus, the color that appears directly before ""walm"" in the input list is repeated in the output list for each instance of ""walm."" This repetition count is always three, regardless of how many times ""walm"" appears.

Rule: ""walm"" signals the repetition of the prior color in the input sequence three times in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

The word ""bluf"" is not explicitly defined in these examples, but given its presence in an input that outputs ""yellow yellow,"" we could guess that ""bluf"" might also be translated as ""yellow,"" or it could be that ""zup"" has a rule-based meaning that overrides other words.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red"".
2. Whenever ""bluf"" preceeds or follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue"".
3. Whenever ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the output is ""green"".
4. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"", the output is ""yellow"".

From this, we can deduce that ""bluf"" inherits or transforms based on the word immediately before it:

- If ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", the word ""bluf"" outputs ""red"".
- If ""lug"" precedes or follows ""bluf"", the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue"".
- If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", the output for ""bluf"" is ""green"".
- If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow"".

There is a pattern where ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the previous word, although it’s not entirely clear how ""wif"" leads to two occurrences of ""red"". This might mean that ""wif"" changes the following word to ""red"" and also duplicates its output.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color associated with the previous word with some exceptions such as duplication after ""wif"".
walm -> meaning. Rule: walm represents the color yellow repeated thrice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax walm wif
    ",Output: yellow green yellow yellow yellow red,yellow green green green red,False,161
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning: blue

Rule: Based on the provided examples, each occurrence of the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" means ""blue."" There is no variation in the output in any example when ""lug"" is used, irrespective of its position in the input sequence or the other words present.
Rule: dax -> green

The pattern in each example shows that whenever the word ""dax"" is encountered, the output is consistently ""green"", regardless of the surrounding words. Therefore, ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"".
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

- When ""wif"" appears, the output always includes ""red"" at least once.
- The number of ""red"" in the output doesn't increase with additional ""wif"" occurrences, which makes it likely that ""wif"" maps to a single ""red"" regardless of repetition.
- There is no dependency on the position of ""wif"" in the input for it to be translated to ""red"" in the output.

Also, considering the other words mapping to colors:

- ""bluf"" always maps to ""yellow"", when not adjacent to ""wif"", and to ""blue"" when it is directly after ""wif"".
- ""zup"" always maps to ""yellow"".
- ""walm"" maps to consecutive ""red"" in the output (three times), suggesting ""walm"" might stand for ""red red red"".
- ""dax"" maps to green.
- ""lug"" maps to blue when it's at the start or the end, but when it comes directly after ""wif"", it translates to ""blue"", following the pattern of ""bluf"".

Therefore, the most consistent rule for ""wif"" seems to be:

Rule: ""wif"" maps to a single color ""red"".

wif -> red.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""zup,"" we should analyze the output colors in relation to their corresponding input words. By comparing the input and output across all examples, it is possible to determine what ""zup"" represents.

Let's consider the consistent patterns:

- ""lug"" always leads to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" always leads to ""red,"" except when preceded by ""zup,"" where it results in ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" always leads to ""red,"" except when following ""zup,"" where it results in ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" always leads to ""green.""

The common factor when ""zup"" is used is that:

- When ""zup"" precedes another word (""zup wif walm""), the immediate word afterward (""wif"") is translated to ""yellow"" instead of its usual color (""red"").
- When ""zup"" follows a word (""lug dax zup wif""), the output color for ""zup"" itself is ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can suggest a rule for what ""zup"" means:

Rule: ""zup"" changes the output color associated with the next word to ""yellow."" If ""zup"" is not directly followed by another word that would usually have a different associated color (like at the end of an input sequence), the output color for ""zup"" itself is ""yellow.""

Therefore, we can define ""zup"" as:

zup -> Changes the following word's output to ""yellow,"" or outputs ""yellow"" if it is the final word.
From the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" is a word that when paired with another word, results in a duplication of the color associated with that other word. Here’s the underlying pattern observed:

- ""lug bluf"" translated to ""blue blue""
- ""dax bluf"" translated to ""green green""
- ""wif bluf"" translated to ""red red""

Based on these patterns, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it repeats the color associated with the word that comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.
Consider the common factor among the various examples:

1. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow
2. wif dax lug walm -> red green blue blue blue
3. lug walm zup lug walm -> blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
4. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
5. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green

From the given examples, ""walm"" appears after a color-indicating word (zup, lug, wif, etc.). The resultant output for ""walm"" is the color word preceding it repeated three times. This suggests that ""walm"" is indicative of a repetition rule for the last color mentioned.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be defined as:

walm -> Replicate the color-related word preceding it three times.

Rule: If X is a color, ""X walm"" translates to ""X X X.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, there is a recurring pattern where the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the word ""blue."" There is no variation in the output for ""lug,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words. However, in the input with multiple words, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when it appears either before or after ""lug."" 

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: In all given examples, the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's first identify patterns related to each known word based on the examples provided:

- Whenever ""dax"" is mentioned, the output is ""green.""
- When ""zup"" is present, the output is ""yellow.""
- The word ""lug"" consistently leads to the output ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" appears once, the output is ""yellow,"" the same as ""zup.""
- ""wif"" corresponds with the output ""red.""

Now, looking at ""bluf"" specifically:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""yellow"", which occurs after ""zup"" and ""lug"" and before another ""zup.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" and the output is ""green.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and ""zup,"" with the output being ""yellow.""
- The fourth example shows ""bluf"" after ""wif,"" with ""red"" as the output.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is at the end after a sequence of ""zup"" and ""lug,"" with ""yellow"" as the output.

Given these observations, ""bluf"" seems to mimic the color output of the word that precedes it. Therefore:

bluf -> the output color of the word before ""bluf."" 

Rule: If ""bluf"" follows another word, use the corresponding color of the preceding word for ""bluf.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the provided examples and their outputs:

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

2. Input: lug walm zup
   Output: blue blue blue yellow

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

4. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

By analyzing the examples, we can see that the word ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat three times before moving on to the next word's associated color. The repetition is consistent, with ""walm"" following ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax,"" all cases resulting in a triplet of the color associated with the preceding word. Therefore, ""walm"" seems to indicate a rule that dictates tripling the representation of the previous word's color in the output sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,163
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look for patterns where ""dax"" appears and the corresponding output color. From the examples:

1. When ""dax"" is present, the output includes ""green"".
2. The output color for ""dax"" does not seem to depend on its position in the input (it can be at the beginning, middle, or end).
3. The color associated with ""dax"" is consistent across all examples.

Comparing this to the other words and outputs:

- ""bluf"" is associated with ""yellow"" when it precedes ""dax"" but turns to ""green"" when following ""dax."" This indicates that ""bluf"" might change based on its position relative to ""dax"".
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" in both instances it appears, regardless of whether it is before or after ""dax.""
- ""wif"" appears once and is associated with ""red.""
- ""lug"" and ""walm"" always follow ""dax"" in the last example and are associated with ""blue.""

Based on this analysis, the presence of ""dax"" is consistently mapped to ""green,"" independent of its position or surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green. ""Dax"" means ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" correlates to the color ""red.""

Examples correlation:
1. ""dax zup walm wif"" -> green yellow yellow yellow red
2. ""lug dax wif lug"" -> blue green red blue
3. ""zup wif"" -> yellow red
4. ""wif dax"" -> red green
5. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow

In each instance where ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output color is ""red.""

Rule:
wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color:

- 'wif' consistently results in 'red'.
- 'bluf' consistently results in 'green'.
- 'lug' consistently results in 'blue'.
- 'dax' consistently results in 'green'.

Given this, we can deduce that 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow', since in every occurrence of 'zup', the word 'yellow' is present in the output.

Thus the rule is: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it. Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another color-word, it takes on that color's name.
walm -> meaning. The meaning of walm appears to be a repetition of the color that is associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. 

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, it instructs to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

Output: red blue

Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
Output: red blue blue red yellow

Output: blue red green

Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Thus, ""lug"" directly translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" seems to consistently correspond to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of what other words (like ""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" or ""lug"") precede or follow it. The other words correlate to other colors, but ""dax"" always results in ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, where ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red,"" we can deduce that:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
Rule: zup -> ""yellow""

Based on the presented examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position within the sequence of words.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" triggers a duplication of the color word that precedes it. When ""bluf"" is used, the previous color word is repeated once. Here is the rule broken down based on the examples:

- In ""lug walm wif lug bluf"", ""lug"" means blue, and the appearance of ""bluf"" after ""lug"" leads to ""blue blue"".
- ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" has ""dax"" before ""bluf"" which is associated with green, resulting in ""green green"" when ""bluf"" is used.
- ""lug bluf"" is just ""lug"" followed by ""bluf"", indicating repetition of the color blue -> ""blue blue"".
- For ""lug wif bluf"", it's the word ""wif"" that comes before ""bluf"", so it leads to ""red red"".
- ""dax lug bluf"" once again shows ""lug"" before ""bluf"", leading to ""blue blue"".

However, ""bluf"" not only repeats the last color word but it also seems to ignore non-color words such as ""walm"" and ""zup"", repeating the closest color term before it.

bluf -> The rule is that ""bluf"" repeats the last mentioned color. If a non-color term is immediately before ""bluf"", it looks further back to the last mentioned color.
Based on the examples provided, there seems to be a pattern regarding the placement and repetition of colors corresponding to the nonce word ""walm"". Each occurrence of the word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"". The rule is that ""walm"" causes the color of the previous word to be repeated three times.

To break down the examples given:

1. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   Explanation: ""lug"" leads to blue, followed by ""walm"" means repeating blue three times. ""Wif"" results in red, followed by ""walm"" means repeating red three times.

2. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   Explanation: ""wif"" gives red, followed by ""walm"" means repeating red three times.

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   Explanation: ""dax"" gives green, followed by ""walm"" means repeating green three times.

4. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   Explanation: ""dax"" leads to green, ""walm"" repeats green three times. The appearance of ""zup"" and ""lug"" translates to yellow and blue, respectively, with ""dax"" at the end again resulting in green.

5. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow
   Explanation: ""dax"" results in green, and ""walm"" repeats green three times, followed by ""zup,"" which results in yellow.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color represented by the word that precedes it to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in each example provided.
Based on the provided examples, each nonce word (zup, lug, walm, wif, bluf, dax) seems to correspond to a particular color. Therefore, let's look at the consistent color corresponding to the word ""dax"" across all examples:

- In the first example, the word ""dax"" appears twice and corresponds to the color green twice.
- In the second example, ""dax"" appears at the beginning and corresponds to the color green.
- In the third example, ""dax"" also appears at the beginning and again corresponds to the color green.
- In the fourth example, it's the same as the second example, with ""dax"" corresponding to green.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" appears at the end and once again corresponds to the color green.

It seems clear from these examples that irrespective of its position in the sequence, ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color green.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at the examples provided, examining where ""zup"" appears and what comes after it in the output:

1. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   
   ""zup"" precedes ""yellow"" in the output.
   
2. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   
   ""zup"" directly translates to ""yellow"" again.
   
3. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
   Output: red green red red yellow red
   
   Here ""zup"" comes before ""yellow"" in the output.
   
4. Input: wif bluf zup
   Output: red red yellow
   
   Again, ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"" in the output.
   
5. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output sequence.

In each instance where the word ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" consistently appears in the corresponding place in the output. This allows us to conclude that the word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" In examples where ""bluf"" appears more than once, ""red"" is repeated the same number of times as ""bluf.""

Moreover, ""bluf"" appears to influence the word preceding it, such that ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input string, thus suggesting that ""wif"" is also translated as ""red"" when followed by ""bluf.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

bluf -> red (when bluf appears alone or not directly preceded by wif)
wif bluf -> red red (when wif is immediately followed by bluf)

Rule: bluf -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" modifies the color word that follows it to make that color repeat a number of times. Each occurrence of ""walm"" is followed by a color repeating three times. Here are specific observations supporting this:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" precedes ""dax,"" which outputs to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" signifying three repetitions of yellow, a color otherwise associated with ""zup.""

2. The second example has ""zup walm"" with the output being ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes a triplet of the color associated with ""zup.""

3. In the third example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" revealing that ""walm"" made ""dax"" (green) repeat three times.

4. Similarly, ""zup walm dax"" in the fourth example leads to ""yellow yellow yellow green,"" showing the ""walm"" effect on ""zup"" and the next color being unaffected.

5. The fifth example demonstrates the ""walm"" effect twice in the sequence: ""walm"" after ""wif"" leads to ""red red red,"" and a later ""walm"" after ""lug zup"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

From these examples, we can deduce:

Rule: When ""walm"" is present before another word that would be associated as a color, that color repeats a total of three times in the output.

Therefore:

walm -> Causes the following color word to repeat three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Each use of ""lug"" in the examples corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output. The surrounding context does not seem to impact this translation, as ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input string or the other words around it.
Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" has a specific meaning when we consider the context. Here is the analysis based on the input and output patterns:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" shows up in the first position of the output sequence.
- The position of ""zup"" in the input doesn't matter, it always maps to ""yellow"" at the first position in the output sequence.
- The remaining words appear to map consistently to colors as well, irrespective of the presence of ""zup"":
  - ""dax"" always maps to ""green"".
  - ""walm"" also always maps to ""green"".
  - ""wif"" always maps to ""red"".
  - ""bluf"" always maps to ""green"" unless it follows ""wif"", where it results in ""red"" (as seen in the third example; this might be a conditional change based on the presence of ""wif"").
  - ""lug"" maps to ""blue"".

Thus, ""zup"" appears to function as a command or modifier that ensures that ""yellow"" is the first color in the output. It does not seem to influence the mapping of the other words to their specific colors.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"", where ""yellow"" is always the first color in the output sequence regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input string.
bluf -> meaning. Meaning: ""bluf"" translates to the color word that immediately precedes it in the input list.

Rule: If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" it means ""blue."" If it is preceded by ""wif,"" it means ""red."" If it is preceded by ""dax,"" it means ""green."" If it is preceded by ""zup,"" it means ""yellow.""
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine when it occurs and the corresponding outputs.

1. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue

2. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue

3. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

5. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red

Analyzing the pairs:

In the first example, ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" and the corresponding output changes from ""red blue"" to ""blue blue blue."" Thus, ""walm"" seems to prolong or replicate the color associated with the word right before it. 

Similarly, in the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green green,"" which supports the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word.

In the third example, ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" and we see ""yellow yellow yellow"" in the output, once again confirming the pattern of repeating the color of the preceding word.

The fourth example further confirms this pattern because it generates ""yellow yellow yellow"" in the output after ""zup walm,"" and it continues with one more ""lug"" resulting in an additional ""blue.""

Finally, the fifth example supports this as we see ""red red red"" following ""wif walm,"" meaning ""walm"" caused the repetition of ""red"" which corresponds to ""wif.""

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, where each occurrence of the word ""dax"" is translated to ""green"" in the output, the rule appears to be quite straightforward.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" based on the provided examples, let's first look at each input and its corresponding output to understand the transformation that occurs:

Example 1:
Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green
Observation: ""zup"" becomes ""yellow,"" ""dax"" becomes ""green,"" and ""bluf"" also becomes ""green.""

Example 2:
Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green
Observation: ""wif"" becomes ""red,"" ""dax"" becomes ""green"" again, and ""bluf"" remains ""green"" even with the change in preceding word.

Example 3:
Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
Observation: ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" ""walm"" results in three consecutive ""yellow."" Given that ""bluf"" was followed by ""lug"" but still resulted in ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" is confirmed not to be ""blue"" and likely to be ""yellow.""

Example 4:
Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
Observation: ""zup"" is ""yellow"" again, and ""walm"" after ""wif"" gives ""red."" Notice, ""wif"" just before ""walm"" leads to multiple ""red."" ""bluf"" results in ""yellow.""

Example 5:
Input: dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow
Observation: Reconfirming ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" ""Bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" and results in ""green,"" which is different from the previous example where ""bluf"" was followed by ""lug"" resulting in ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, it's clear that ""bluf"" has no fixed color transformation. Instead, it replicates the color of the word that is immediately preceding it. When ""zup"" is before ""bluf,"" it will be ""yellow""; when ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green""; and we can assume that if ""wif"" were to precede ""bluf,"" the result would be ""red.""

Rule:
bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" takes the color associated with the word immediately before it.
Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to be a sequence repetition indicator, causing the previous color word to be repeated three times. For instance, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" and ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red.""

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the previous color word three times.

Based on the provided examples, the following pattern emerges:

- Every time the input is ""dax"" alone, the output is ""green"".
- In other sequences where multiple words are present, each instance of ""dax"" still translates to ""green"".

Furthermore, although not explicitly asked for, one might observe a potential pattern for the other words as well:

- ""lug"" seems to correlate with ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"", but ""blue"" when it precedes ""walm"".
- ""zup"" could potentially mean ""red"" when following ""dax wif"" or ""yellow"" in the last position.
- ""wif"" itself does not have enough examples to deduce its meaning.
- ""walm"" likely means ""blue"", as it corresponds with the output ""blue"" each time it appears, and the number of repetitions of ""blue"" match the number of occurrences of ""walm"" in the last input.

However, since the request is only for the meaning of ""dax,"" the deduced rule is:

dax -> meaning: green

Rule: Regardless of its position in a sequence, ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each instance of ""zup"" in the input results in the word ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the words around it. Hence, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to be associated with the repetition of the color that precedes it three times in the sequence. Here's the evidence that supports this:

1. In the first example, 'lug walm' translates to 'blue blue blue'.
2. In the second example, 'lug walm' again results in 'blue blue blue'.
3. In the third example, 'zup walm' translates to 'yellow yellow yellow'.
4. In the fourth example, 'dax walm' translates to 'green green green'.
5. In the fifth example, 'dax walm' again results in 'green green green'.

Every time ""walm"" follows a color-coded word, that color is repeated three times in the output. Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color indicated by the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to be associated with a color output. By looking at the patterns in which the word ""wif"" appears and the corresponding output, we can attempt to deduce what ""wif"" means in terms of color output:

- In all instances where ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" is part of the output immediately after it.

- ""wif"" does not seem to depend on any specific context or surrounding words, as it consistently results in the color ""red,"" regardless of the words that come before or after it.

Thus, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" results in the color ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" in this context can be stated as:

wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" is consistently translated to the word ""yellow"" in the Output. Here is the rule based on the examples:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> duplicates the color of the previous word. Rule: When bluf follows a color word, the output is the color of that word repeated once.
Rule: ""walm"" -> The color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
From the provided examples, we can try to induce the rule for the nonce word ""dax."" Each example translates a set of input words into a set of colors. Specifically, we can examine the inputs and outputs where ""dax"" appears to understand its meaning.

Input: dax lug bluf wif
Output: green blue blue red
- Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green
- In a two-word sequence, ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""Dax"" appears at the beginning and the entire output is green, reinforcing ""dax"" as ""green.""

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green
- ""Dax"" appears at the end, and its output is ""green.""

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
- In a sequence of six words where ""dax"" appears in the middle and end, it still corresponds to ""green.""

From these examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that precede or follow it.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in every example given.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in every instance it appears within the given inputs and outputs.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"". The presence of the word ""bluf"" consistently results in ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the other words around it. Therefore, the rule would be:

Rule: bluf -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" translates to the color green when it follows the word ""dax,"" and to yellow when it follows any other word. Here's the breakdown of the translations:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
- When ""walm"" follows any other word (e.g., ""lug"" or ""zup""), the output is ""yellow.""

Rule: ""walm"" -> following ""dax,"" it means green; otherwise, it means yellow.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup wif dax lug bluf zup
    ",Output: yellow red green blue blue yellow,yellow red green blue blue yellow,True,171
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In each example where 'lug' is mentioned, the output always includes the color blue. The position of 'lug' in each input corresponds to the position of 'blue' in the output, indicating that 'lug' translates to 'blue' regardless of context.
dax -> green. Rule: The word 'dax' corresponds to the color 'green' in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".
To determine what ""bluf"" means, we should look at the output that corresponds to each input where ""bluf"" is used. Here are the examples:

1. ""zup wif bluf"" correlates with ""yellow red red""
2. ""wif bluf dax"" correlates with ""red red green""
3. ""dax lug bluf wif"" correlates with ""green blue blue red""
4. ""wif bluf"" correlates with ""red red""
5. ""zup bluf"" correlates with ""yellow yellow""

We can see a pattern that wherever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output color is repeated. For example, in ""wif bluf"" (input) and ""red red"" (output), the color red follows and is repeated. Another example is ""zup bluf"" (input) and ""yellow yellow"" (output), where the color yellow follows ""zup"" and is then repeated for ""bluf"".

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" means ""repeat the previous color"".

Rule: bluf -> repeat the previous color
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first look at the number of colors in the output corresponding to the input sentences:

1. Input: wif walm zup -> Output: red red red yellow
   - The sequence ""wif"" generates ""red red"" and the sequence ""zup"" generates ""yellow,"" implying ""walm"" generates a single ""red.""

2. Input: dax walm wif bluf -> Output: green green green red red
   - The sequence ""dax"" generates ""green green,"" the sequence ""wif"" generates ""red red,"" and ""bluf"" has not appeared in previous examples. Since ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and ""wif"" succeeds ""walm,"" and we have one extra ""green"" in the sequence, it may imply that ""walm"" by itself generates one ""green.""

3. Input: zup wif dax walm -> Output: yellow red green green green
   - From the previous examples, we know that ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green green."" At the end of the sequence, we have an extra ""green,"" which is consistent with the implication from the second example that ""walm"" may produce a single ""green.""

4. Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
   - As ""dax"" generates ""green green"" and the output has an extra ""green,"" it further supports the idea that ""walm"" generates a single ""green.""

5. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   - By analyzing the output, ""lug"" generates ""blue blue,"" and ""wif"" generates ""red."" The extra ""blue"" in the output could come from ""bluf,"" as it appears at the end, leaving ""walm"" as the single ""green,"" as it is followed by ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

Based on the given examples, ""walm"" seems to generate a color in the output regardless of its position or surrounding words, with each example suggesting that it corresponds to a single ""green.""

Rule: walm -> green.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds with the color blue.

Rule: ""lug"" means blue.
Based on the given examples, it appears that each word is associated with a specific color. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Other words seem to have their own color associations as well, such as ""wif"" with ""red"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow.""

Rule: dax -> green
From the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" consistently results in the word ""red"" in the output. Therefore, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow. 

Each instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
Rule: bluf -> red

Based on the given examples, bluf consistently corresponds to the color red in the outputs.
Analyzing the examples provided, we can notice a pattern on how the word ""walm"" affects the output.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue

Looking at the patterns, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color output associated with the word just before it, three times. For instance, in the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and when followed by ""walm,"" the output is three ""yellow"" words. In the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and when ""walm"" follows it, there are three ""red"" words in the output.

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to act as a command that repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" in every input correlates with the word ""blue"" in the corresponding output.
Based on the given examples, we can observe the following:

- In examples where ""wif dax"" or ""dax wif"" appear, the corresponding outputs are ""red green"" or ""green red,"" respectively. This suggests ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" likely corresponds to ""green.""
  
- In examples where ""lug dax"" or ""dax lug"" appear, the corresponding outputs are ""blue green"" or ""green blue,"" respectively. This suggests ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" again likely corresponds to ""green.""

- In the third example where only ""dax wif dax"" is given, the output is ""green red green,"" reinforcing that ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""

- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""wif bluf dax lug"" corresponds to ""red red green blue,"" where ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""dax"" appears to be ""green"" once more, consistent with previous deductions.

Therefore, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in all given examples.
To deduce the meaning of 'zup', let's analyze the patterns where 'zup' appears across the examples provided.

In every example where 'zup' appears, the corresponding output is always 'yellow'. Therefore, it seems that 'zup' translates directly to the color 'yellow', regardless of context. This is a straightforward one-to-one mapping from the input to the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf -> repeat the last color mentioned before it.
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be dependent on the word that immediately precedes it. Specifically:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is three instances of ""yellow.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is three instances of ""green.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is three instances of ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is three instances of ""red.""

Given this pattern, it seems that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of three instances of the color associated with the word directly before it. Here is the rule summarized:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Triple repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
- ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the meaning of ""lug"" can be deduced to be the color ""blue"".

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" every time it appears.
Rule: wif -> red
Observing the examples provided, I deduce that ""zup"" has a consistent translation across all inputs. 

In every instance where ""zup"" is present, the output is ""yellow."" There are no examples in which ""zup"" leads to a different output. Therefore, it seems that ""zup"" is directly translated to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be taking on the color value of the word that immediately precedes it. In every given input, the output for ""bluf"" is a repeat of the color represented by the word directly before it:

- In the first and third examples, ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red"". So here, ""bluf"" means ""red"" because it follows ""wif"", which represents the color red.
- In the second example, ""lug bluf"" leads to ""blue blue"" and ""zup bluf lug"" leads to ""yellow yellow blue"". Thus, ""bluf"" represents ""blue"" after ""lug"" and ""yellow"" after ""zup"".
- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf"" and ""dax bluf"" each time result in a repetition of the color represented by the words ""lug"" (blue) and ""dax"" (green).
- Similarly, in the fifth example, ""dax bluf"" again results in ""green green"", indicating that ""bluf"" takes on the color green following ""dax"".

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that comes immediately before bluf.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look at the pattern of colors in the output relative to the presence of the word ""walm"" in the input. Here are the observations:

1. When ""lug walm"" appears, the output is ""blue blue blue.""
   - It seems that ""lug"" translates to a single ""blue.""

2. When ""dax walm"" appears, the output is ""green green green.""
   - It seems that ""dax"" translates to a single ""green.""

3. When ""wif walm"" appears, the output is ""red red red.""
   - It seems that ""wif"" translates to a single ""red.""

In all instances of ""walm,"" it is followed by a color that is represented three times. 

Given these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" triples the color that is represented by the word preceding it.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"":
walm -> repetition of the preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True,175
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".
dax -> green. Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in a sequence of words.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" I will consider the repeated patterns and changes that occur in the examples provided:

1. Every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is consistently ""red."" This suggests that ""wif"" corresponds directly to ""red.""

2. In the inputs where words other than ""wif"" are present, those words (""walm,"" ""zup,"" ""dax"") seem to correspond to colors other than red, indicated by the terms ""yellow,"" ""green,"" and an increase in the number of ""yellow""s in the output. However, since the question only asks for the meaning of ""wif,"" we'll focus on that term.

Given this, we arrive at the rule:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that:

Input: zup
Output: yellow

The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" when it is the only word in the input.

Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
Output: yellow yellow red blue green

Each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Input: dax zup lug bluf
Output: green yellow blue blue

Again, each word corresponds to a color, with ""zup"" representing ""yellow"".

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red"".

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Notice that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". ""Walm"" does not have a direct correspondence, but when repeated, it seems to repeat the next word's output, in this case, ""yellow"" from ""zup"" and ""blue"" from ""lug"".

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""

In all the examples given, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently maps to the color ""yellow"".
Based on the given input and output examples, we can try to deduce the rule by which the word ""bluf"" is being translated into a color.

In each example, the occurrence of ""bluf"" in the output is represented by the color word ""yellow."" Additionally, ""bluf"" seems to appear twice in the output regardless of its position in the input. Since no other words in the inputs are consistently translated into the word ""yellow,"" and the repetition pattern is unique to ""bluf,"" we can infer the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> ""yellow yellow""

Meaning, whenever the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""yellow"" being outputted twice.
Rule: walm seems to signify a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""wif zup walm dax zup,"" walm is followed by three ""yellow"" which is the color corresponding to ""zup.""
- In the second example, ""wif lug walm,"" walm is followed by three ""blue"" which corresponds to ""lug.""
- In the third example, ""dax wif walm,"" walm is followed by three ""red"" which corresponds to ""wif.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax walm,"" walm is followed by three times the color ""green,"" which corresponds to ""dax.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif lug dax walm,"" walm repeats the color ""green"" which corresponds to ""dax,"" the word immediately before walm.

Based on the examples, we infer that ""walm"" indicates repetition of the last color mentioned.

walm -> Repeats the color of the word immediately before it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,176
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each instance of ""dax"" in the input is translated to ""green"" in the output. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, each instance of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output. It seems that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Additionally, other words like ""zup,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" correspond to their own color outputs, such as ""yellow,"" ""green,"" and ""blue,"" respectively.

The rule appears to be a direct mapping from specific nonce words to colors:

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""zup,"" let's try to establish a relationship between the inputs and outputs. We will compare the positions of ""zup"" in the input to the colors in the output.

1. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow
2. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
3. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
4. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
5. zup dax wif -> yellow green red

Let's check each position where ""zup"" appears and the corresponding color:

- When ""zup"" is at the end of the sequence (Example 1 and 4), the corresponding color is yellow.
- When ""zup"" is at the beginning of the sequence (Examples 2, 3, and 5), the corresponding color is also yellow.

In every example given, regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence, the output color is always yellow. Therefore, we can induce that the rule for ""zup"" is that it always corresponds to the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Regardless of the position or the other words (dax, lug, wif, zup) surrounding ""bluf"" in the input, the output always includes the color red in the position matching ""bluf."" Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> red
To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the pattern in each input and its corresponding output.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
In this case, ""dax"" leads to a single ""green"" and ""walm"" seems to repeat it twice more.

Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue
Here, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to repeat ""blue"" twice more.

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red
In this example, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" seems to repeat ""red"" twice more.

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue
Observing this, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""walm"" duplicates ""blue"" two more times, ""wif"" is ""red,"" and the final ""lug"" is ""blue,"" sticking to the established pattern.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Again, ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats it two more times.

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" takes the color associated with the word immediately before it and repeats that color two more times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm lug

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
dax -> green

Rule: Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, irrespective of its position in the input sequence. Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" is produced in the output at the corresponding position. Thus, the word ""dax"" means green.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to examine the relation between the ""Input"" and ""Output"" pairs, looking for consistent patterns.

Let's examine each input/output pair:

1. Input: zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow yellow red
   
2. Input: wif dax lug
   Output: red green blue

3. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

4. Input: lug dax lug wif
   Output: blue green blue red

5. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red

From the above examples, we can see a pattern:
- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
- The word ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow.""
- The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue.""
- The word ""dax"" is translated to ""green.""


Based on this pattern, it seems that ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input string. Therefore, we can deduce that:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided where the nonce word ""zup"" is used, we can observe the following:

- The word ""zup"" corresponds to an output color each time it appears.
- Comparing the inputs and outputs, ""zup"" does not correspond to the same color as any other word in the input. It always results in the color ""yellow.""
- The pattern does not appear to change based on the position of ""zup"" in the sequence.

From these observations, we can induce the following rule:

zup -> ""yellow""
To determine the meaning of ""bluf"", we can compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs and look for patterns.

Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red

Input: dax bluf wif
Output: green green red

Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
Output: blue red red green blue blue

Input: wif lug zup bluf
Output: red blue yellow yellow

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

From the inputs and outputs, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates directly to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words. 
Every time ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding place in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> blue
Observing the patterns, we can attempt to discern the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" based on its context and the corresponding colors in the output.

In every example where ""walm"" appears, we see a sequence of colors where ""blue"" appears multiple times in a row. This suggests that ""walm"" induces a repetition of ""blue"" in the output. We can examine the number of times ""blue"" appears after each instance of ""walm"" to determine if there's a consistent pattern.

1. lug walm zup lug walm -> blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue (3 * blue, yellow, 3 * blue)
2. lug walm -> blue blue blue (3 * blue)
3. wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green (3 * green)
4. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow (3 * red)
5. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red (3 * red)

We notice that ""walm"" is consistently followed by three occurrences of a single color, irrespective of the color that follows ""walm."" The specific color that appears three times seems to depend on the previous word in the sequence. 

For example:
- After ""lug,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- After ""wif,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.
- After ""dax,"" ""green"" is repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it triggers a repetition of the color corresponding to the word before it, repeating that color three times.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,178
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence.
From the examples provided, we can try to make connections between the presence of the word ""wif"" and the colors in the outputs:

Input: dax zup wif -> Output: green yellow red
Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red
Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
Input: wif -> Output: red
Input: zup bluf wif dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow red green blue

Observations:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" is in the output. 
- ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"" regardless of its position.
- In every instance where ""wif"" is alone or the last word in the sequence, ""red"" is the last color in the output sequence.
- No matter how many other words are before ""wif,"" ""red"" is always produced in the output.
- ""wif"" does not seem to affect the presence of other colors, which suggests that other words like ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" etc., correspond to the other colors in the output.

Rule:
wif -> ""red"" (The presence of the word ""wif"" in any position in the input sequence always corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output sequence.)
zup -> meaning. Rule: zup translates to ""yellow"".
Rule: bluf -> yellow

Based on the provided examples, whenever the word ""bluf"" appears in the Input, the corresponding Output is ""yellow."" This pattern holds true across all given examples regardless of the position of ""bluf"" within the sequence.
Based on the examples given, we can induce the following rules for each input element:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".

Given this pattern, it appears that ""walm"" produces a sequence of three colors that are the same as the color corresponding to the word preceding it. Here are the inductions:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"", indicating that ""walm"" repeats the ""green"" that corresponds to ""dax"" three times.
- Correspondingly, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", where ""walm"" repeats the ""yellow"" that corresponds to ""zup"" three times.
- Whenever ""walm"" was used in sequence with other words like ""lug"" or ""wif,"" a different color was produced for those words but did not alter the repetition of three colors for ""walm"".

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, it outputs the color corresponding to that word three times consecutively.

Hence, the meaning can be described as:

walm -> A repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow,blue yellow,True,179
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in the output. Every occurrence of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
wif -> meaning. Meaning: red. Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
zup -> meaning. Meaning: yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" seems to change color based on the preceding word according to the following pattern:

- When preceded by ""wif,"" the word ""bluf"" yields the color green.
- When preceded by ""lug,"" the word ""bluf"" yields the color blue.
- When preceded by ""zup,"" the word ""bluf"" yields the color yellow.
- When preceded by ""dax,"" the word ""bluf"" yields the color green.

No other precedents for ""bluf"" are provided in the examples, so additional rules cannot be determined.

Based on the evidence from the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be that it takes the color output that was produced by the word directly preceding it in the sequence.

Therefore:

bluf -> the meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color indicated by the word that comes directly before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the corresponding color outputs in each example where ""walm"" appears:

1. bluf wif walm -> yellow red red red
2. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
3. dax walm -> green green green
4. walm wif -> yellow yellow red
5. dax walm -> green green green

One pattern that immediately stands out is that after ""walm"" the same color is repeated:

1. red red red
2. yellow yellow
3. green green
4. yellow yellow
5. green green

It appears that ""walm"" causes the next word's associated color to repeat multiple times. Now, let's see what color each repeated word corresponds to (ignoring ""walm""):

1. wif -> red
2. zup -> yellow
3. dax -> green
4. wif -> red
5. dax -> green

Using the context of each sentence, this is the inferred rule:

walm -> Causes the next word's color to be repeated twice more, for a total of three consecutive appearances of that color.

Rule: If the next word corresponds to a color, ""walm"" causes that color to appear three times in a row.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,180
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples:

- When 'dax lug' is input, the output is 'green blue'. Because 'dax' on its own typically outputs 'green', we can deduct that 'lug' by itself corresponds to 'blue'.
- When 'lug' is input by itself, the output is 'blue', which reinforces the prior deduction.
- When 'lug zup dax zup' is input, the output is 'blue yellow green yellow'. We know 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' and 'dax' to 'green', so 'lug' here also aligns with 'blue'.
- When 'zup wif lug' is input, the output is 'yellow red blue'. We know 'zup' results in 'yellow', and there is no established meaning for 'wif', but since 'lug' appears at the end as in prior examples and the last color is 'blue', it again points to 'lug' meaning 'blue'.

Rule: lug -> blue.
From the given examples, we can notice a pattern regarding the appearance of the word ""dax"" and the corresponding color in the output. Here's the pattern:

- In the first example, the input ""dax"" corresponds to a ""green"" output.
- In the second and fourth examples, whenever ""dax"" is present, ""green"" consistently follows its position, regardless of the other words around it.
- Similarly, in the third and fifth examples, ""dax"" is followed by a ""green"" output, confirming that ""dax"" directly translates to ""green.""

It appears that the word ""dax"" consistently equates to the color ""green"" in the output, no matter the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence or the presence of other words. Therefore, we can deduce the rule as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red.
zup -> meaning. The word ""zup"" corresponds with the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present.

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the color yellow is included in the output in place of ""zup"".
Rule: ""bluf"" indicates that the color output should be repeated once.

This is shown by the examples where the word before ""bluf"" corresponds to a color, and the output for ""bluf"" is to repeat that color:

- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" (the color ""red"" appears twice)
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"" (the color ""yellow"" appears twice)
- ""lug bluf"" would then imply ""blue blue"" if ""lug"" corresponded to ""blue"" based on the ""dax lug bluf dax"" sequence.

Therefore, bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" means to repeat the color word that appears immediately before it in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to determine the meaning or rule underlying the nonce word ""walm"".

Let's first look at the colors associated with other words and how they figure in the different examples. 

From examples 1 and 2:
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""

From examples 3, 4, and 5:
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"" (assuming it directly correlates given example 3)
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red""

Now, observing the output related to ""walm"":

Example 1: ""zup walm lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue""
Example 2: ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
Example 3: ""wif dax lug walm"" -> ""red green blue blue blue""
Example 4: ""dax zup walm wif"" -> ""green yellow yellow yellow red""
Example 5: ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""

The presence of the word ""walm"" appears to add a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. ""Walm"" does not seem to have a color of its own but reflects the color associated with the word immediately before it in the sequence. 

For example:
- In Example 1, ""walm"" follows ""zup"", and it adds two more ""yellow"" to the output.
- In Example 3, ""walm"" follows ""lug"", resulting in two additional ""blue"" in the output.

Hence, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be about repetition. It repeats the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Based on the examples provided, every instance of the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green"" consistently, regardless of its position in the input. Thus, it does not seem to depend on the context or the surrounding words. The rule can be deduced as:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" can be identified as follows:

- For every occurrence of ""wif"" in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" can be deduced to be ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red.
To figure out what ""zup"" means, let's analyze the examples provided:

1. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow

2. Input: lug zup wif
   Output: blue yellow red

3. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

4. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow

5. Input: zup lug
   Output: yellow blue

Looking at the data, ""zup"" always corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output. It does not seem to matter where ""zup"" appears in the sequence or which words are around it. The word ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow,"" suggesting that ""zup"" could simply mean ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color immediately preceding it. Here's a breakdown of each example and how ""bluf"" relates to the preceding color:

1. In the sequence ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup,"" ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" and ""lug"" correlates with ""blue."" Whenever ""bluf"" appears directly after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow,"" and when ""bluf"" appears directly after ""lug,"" the output is ""blue."" This suggests that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

2. In the sequence ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" and ""dax"" correlates with ""green."" When ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow."" The word ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" and since ""wif"" appears after ""bluf,"" it does not affect ""bluf's"" interpretation as the color changes to ""red"" only after ""bluf.""

3. The sequence ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" also supports this observation. ""Zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue."" When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""

4. The sequence ""wif bluf"" provides an output of ""red red,"" which means that ""bluf"" took on the color associated with ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

5. The sequence ""dax bluf"" provides an output of ""green green,"" meaning that ""bluf"" took on the color associated with ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" mirrors the color of the word that comes immediately before it. If no color precedes it for some reason (not evidenced in the provided data), a default or another rule might need to be determined, but that is not the case in the given examples.

So, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it.
Based on the examples provided:

- ""dax walm zup"" leads to ""green green green yellow"", while ""lug walm zup"" leads to ""blue blue blue yellow"". This shows that walm takes on the color of the word that appears before it, as ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""dax lug wif walm"" leads to ""green blue red red red"", which further supports the idea that walm takes the color of the preceding word as ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", again showing that walm assumes the color of the previous word, with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"".
- ""dax walm"" yields ""green green green"", sticking to the rule that walm matches the color of the word before it, here ""dax"" which is ""green"".

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
Based on the provided input and output pairs, it seems that each word corresponds to a color:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow

Analyzing the position of ""dax"" in each input, and its corresponding output, it appears that ""dax"" always translates to ""green"":

- lug wif lug dax bluf -> blue red blue green green
- lug dax wif -> blue green red
- wif dax lug dax -> red green blue green
- dax wif -> green red
- zup dax -> yellow green

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words.
Based on the examples given, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Every instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output sequence, regardless of its position or the context within the given input sequence.
By examining the examples provided and their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to induce the rule that governs the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"". Let's analyze each one.

1. Input: wif dax zup bluf
   Output: red green yellow yellow
2. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
3. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
4. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue
5. Input: zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green

Looking at the placement of ""bluf"" and the colors that follow in each example, we try to identify a pattern:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", and the output is a repetition of the previous color, ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" again follows ""zup"", and it repeats the previous color, ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", and it repeats the previous color, ""red"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", and the output is ""blue blue"". This is the only instance where ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", and it may be that ""lug"" itself translates to ""blue"", resulting in a repeat of the color.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" again, and ""yellow"" is repeated as before.

Given the evidence, ""bluf"" appears to repeat the color of the word that precedes it. This leads us to deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word.
Walm -> The color before walm is repeated for the next series of colors until a different color word appears.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is encountered, it duplicates the color associated with the previous word, continuing this pattern until a new color word is introduced.

Evidence supporting this rule:

- In the first example, ""dax walm wif zup"" corresponds to ""green green green red yellow."" After ""dax,"" which translates to green, ""walm"" repeats the color green until ""wif"" changes it to red.
  
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" simply duplicates the red color associated with ""wif.""

- In the third example, ""zup wif walm lug"" starts with yellow for ""zup,"" changes to red for ""wif,"" then ""walm"" repeats the red until ""lug,"" which changes the color to blue.

- In the fourth example, ""zup walm lug wif"" begins with yellow for ""zup,"" then ""walm"" repeats the yellow until ""lug"" changes it to blue, finally ""wif"" changes it to red.

- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif,"" we see that ""wif"" is red, ""bluf"" is red (even though ""bluf"" isn't directly given a color, it keeps the color sequence consistent), ""dax"" is green, followed by another ""bluf"" which is green, ""wif"" turns it back to red, ""walm"" duplicates the red twice until ""lug"" which is blue, followed by the last ""wif"" turning it back to red again.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green. 

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""dax"" appears in an input, the corresponding output is ""green"". This indicates that ""dax"" means ""green"" in this context.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in all given examples. Regardless of the other words' associated colors or their order, ""wif"" consistently translates to red.
Analyzing the provided input and output pairs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""zup"" based on its context and the corresponding output color. After looking into each example, it seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Here is a breakdown:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the color ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output at the same position.
- ""zup"" does not depend on surrounding words for its translation, as it translates to ""yellow"" regardless of the context or words that follow or precede it.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""zup"" can be concluded as:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in the examples provided:

Input: dax bluf wif lug -> Output: green green red blue
Input: wif lug zup bluf -> Output: red blue yellow yellow
Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
Input: wif dax bluf -> Output: red green green
Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> Output: red green yellow red green green

Observing the patterns, it becomes evident that the output color for ""bluf"" is consistently the same as the color for the word that immediately precedes it. Let's verify this:

In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the color for both is green.
In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the color for both is yellow.
In the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the color for both is red.

Therefore, we can establish the following rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color of the word immediately before it.
Upon examining the given inputs and their associated outputs, we can see that the word ""walm"" appears to consistently correspond to ""green green green"" in the output, regardless of the context or the other words in the sequence. Here's the breakdown of instances:

- ""dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue blue blue,"" and we can identify ""green"" as the color associated with ""dax"" and ""blue"" with ""lug."" The word ""walm"" is followed by ""blue blue blue,"" which suggests that ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" in this context. However, considering more examples, we see that ""lug"" actually corresponds to ""blue,"" and the additional ""blue blue"" is attributed to ""walm.""
- ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" gives ""green blue blue blue green red red green,"" and if we follow the pattern from above, ""walm"" again is followed by ""blue blue blue,"" despite the colors for ""dax"" being ""green"" and ""wif"" and ""bluf"" subsequently being ""red red."" 
- In ""wif bluf dax walm,"" we see ""red red green green green,"" further supporting that ""walm"" is followed by ""green green green.""
- ""zup dax walm zup wif"" results in ""yellow green green green yellow red,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" leaving ""walm"" again followed by ""green green green.""
- Finally, ""lug zup dax walm"" gives ""blue yellow green green green,"" keeping consistent with the established pattern for the other words and revealing that ""walm"" is consistently followed by ""green green green.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
Rule: walm -> three consecutive greens (""green green green"").

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Each example where the word ""wif"" appears corresponds to the color red in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Observing the given examples and their respective outputs, it appears that ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" Now let's verify this for each example:

- Example 1: ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""green red yellow yellow red red red""
  Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow"" which corresponds to ""wif"" and precedes ""red red"" which also corresponds to ""wif"".
  
- Example 2: ""wif lug zup bluf"" -> ""red blue yellow yellow""
  Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the last ""yellow"".
  
- Example 3: ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""
  Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red"".
  
- Example 4: ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
  Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red"".
  
- Example 5: ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue""
  Here, ""bluf"" occurs twice and each time it corresponds to ""green"" following ""dax"" and then ""red"".

Analyzing the first example:
Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

Here, ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"" twice, and ""walm"" is followed by another ""blue."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Looking at the second example:
Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

""Zup"" is followed by ""yellow"" ""bluf"" does not seem to correspond to any color in the output, as it changes position but there isn't a new color in the output patterns. ""Lug"" is consistently followed by ""blue,"" and ""walm"" here is followed by ""yellow,"" which is the same color that precedes it.

In the third example:
Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" is followed by ""blue,"" which is the same color as the one that precedes it.

In the fourth example:
Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" again is followed by ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

In the fifth example:
Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""Walm"" is followed by ""yellow"" right after another ""yellow.""

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" is followed by the color that immediately precedes it. The rule for ""walm"" would be that it repeats the color word that directly precedes it in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color word that is directly before walm in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,186
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" All inputs containing the word ""lug"" result in an output that includes the color blue at the corresponding position of ""lug.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Every instance of ""dax"" in the input leads to the output of ""green."" Additionally, other words in the input also seem to correspond to specific colors in the output, although you only asked about the meaning of ""dax."" Therefore:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

Each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
Given the examples provided, it appears that the word 'bluf' correlates with the color 'red' being repeated twice. 

For each occurrence:
- When 'bluf' is mentioned, the output consistently includes 'red red'.
- When 'bluf' is not mentioned, the sequence 'red red' does not appear.

Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> 'red red'
To discern the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let us identify its position and the corresponding output in each example:

1. lug wif dax **walm** zup     -> blue red green **green** green yellow
2. zup dax **walm** zup wif -> yellow green **green** green yellow red
3. lug zup **walm** lug               -> blue yellow **yellow** yellow blue
4. zup wif **walm**                     -> yellow red **red** red
5. dax **walm** zup                  -> green **green** green yellow

From the provided examples, we can observe that the word following ""walm"" is always repeated three times in the output, and they are colored with the same color. Thus, we can induce the following rule for walm:

Rule: walm causes the next word's color to be repeated three times in sequence.

So, ""walm"" -> meaning: a repeater for the next word's corresponding color, outputted three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup bluf
    ",Output: green yellow red red,green yellow yellow,False,187
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, lug consistently maps to the word ""blue."" 

Rule: lug = blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the pattern of words and their corresponding colors.

1. Pairing each ""dax"" with its output, it seems that every instance of ""dax"" is matched with the color green. Additionally, the word ""dax"" is never associated with any color other than green, regardless of the position in the sequence or the words that come before or after it.

2. Checking against the other words and outputs:

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red.
- ""zup"" always corresponds to yellow.
- ""lug"" is matched with blue once, and there are no instances to suggest otherwise.
- ""walm"" is associated with green when it appears, but not specifically attributed to ""dax.""

With these observations, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position or surrounding context.

Rule: dax -> green.
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the given examples, whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output consistently includes ""red."" Therefore, wif translates to red regardless of its position or the context within the string of words.
zup -> yellow

Rule: Regardless of its position or the words around it, ""zup"" always results in the output ""yellow.""
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" indicates repeating the colors of the words that preceded it in the sequence, in reverse order. To be precise, for each word that represents a color, ""bluf"" causes that color to be output twice and in the reverse sequence of their appearance. 

Let's analyze the examples to define the rule:

- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""wif"" corresponds to red. After ""bluf,"" the output is blue red red, which confirms that ""bluf"" repeated the preceding colors in reverse order.
- In the second example, ""wif"" and ""lug"" correspond to red and blue respectively. After ""bluf,"" the output shows ""blue blue red red red"", repeating both red and blue in reverse order.
- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" to red, and ""zup"" to yellow. After ""bluf,"" the output is ""green red green yellow yellow,"" once again confirming that the colors are repeated in reverse order.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows after ""wif"" and ""dax,"" which correspond to red and green. The output after ""bluf"" includes red and green repeated twice, as observed from previous patterns.
- The fifth example further confirms the rule, as ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax"" correspond to blue, red, and green. After ""bluf,"" the sequence of these colors is repeated in reverse, resulting in ""blue red green green red blue.""

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" can be formulated as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeat the sequence of the colors represented by the nonce words preceding ""bluf"" in reverse order, each color repeated twice.
walm -> repeats the color associated with the previous word the number of times the word ""walm"" has been used sequentially. Rule:

- The first use of ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word once (see ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue"").
- The second sequential use of ""walm"" repeats the color twice (see ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue"").
- The third sequential use of ""walm"" repeats the color three times (see ""dax walm lug"" -> ""green green green blue"").
- The fourth use that is not sequential does not repeat because there is a word (lug) interrupting the sequence but again starts a new sequence (see ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"").
- In the last example, each time ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it repeats ""red"" three times because it's the third use in its sequence, separated by ""zup lug,"" which produce their own colors.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words around it.
Rule:
dax -> green

Each example demonstrates that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green"", regardless of the other words around it. Thus, in this context, ""dax"" means ""green"".
Rule: ""wif"" means ""red."" The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" consistently in the given examples, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" is a function that replicates the color associated with the word that comes before it. Each word in the input seems to correspond to a particular color in the output. Here is the observed pattern:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the color is yellow (""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"").
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the color is red (""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"").
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the color is green (""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"").

Therefore:

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color associated with the previous word.
walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" appears to be the word ""blue"" repeated the number of times following its first mention. 

Rule: For each occurrence of the nonce word ""walm,"" output the word ""blue"" as many times as there are words following ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of dax, we'll look at the examples given and the corresponding outputs to see if we can determine a pattern or rule.

- When the input is ""dax"" alone, the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output is ""green red,"" suggesting ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" might correspond to ""red.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""lug,"" the output starts with ""green"" followed by a series of ""blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" might correspond to the color ""blue"" and possibly repeats colors.
- When ""dax"" precedes both ""lug"" and ""wif"" with ""walm"" at the end, the output is ""green blue red red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" might correspond to repeating the previous color.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule for dax:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" when it appears in the input, regardless of its position or the presence of other words.
Based on the examples provided, we have the following:

1. dax bluf wif zup dax → green green red yellow green
2. zup dax wif → yellow green red
3. wif → red
4. wif lug walm → red blue blue blue
5. wif bluf → red red

Analyzing the outputs, we can see that every time the word ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output is ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input or the context provided by the other words.

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. 

Writing this as you requested:

wif -> red
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to observe the common patterns and relationships in different examples.

Let's look at each input and its corresponding output.

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

2. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

3. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

5. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

Analyzing these patterns, we can deduce that:
- ""zup"" results in ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" results in ""green.""
- ""lug"" results in ""blue.""
- ""wif"" results in ""red.""
- ""walm"" results in ""blue"" or ""red"" depending on its position.

Now, let's focus on ""bluf"" specifically:
- Whenever ""bluf"" appears right after ""zup,"" the next colour is the same as ""zup"" (yellow).
- Whenever ""bluf"" appears right after ""dax,"" the next colour is the same as ""dax"" (green).

A pattern emerges where ""bluf"" seems to repeat the colour of the word preceding it. Let's verify this with the input-output pairs:
- In example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow) and the output is ""yellow"" repeated once.
- In example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (which corresponds to green) and the output is ""green"" repeated once.
- In example 3, ""bluf"" again follows ""zup,"" resulting in an additional ""yellow"" in the output.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" (which corresponds to red) and the output shows ""red"" repeated once more.

Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.
Analyzing the inputs and the corresponding outputs:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax lug"", the output is a sequence of ""blue blue blue blue"", which indicates that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". The triple occurrence of the color ""blue"" following ""walm"" suggests that ""walm"" might represent a repetition of the color that precedes it.
  
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which we know represents ""blue"", the output is ""blue blue blue"", once again indicating that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the preceding color.
  
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup dax"", and ""zup"" results in ""yellow"", the output after ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow"", again showing a repetition of the preceding color.
  
- When ""walm"" is preceded only by ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"", the output is ""red red red"", yet another case where ""walm"" causes the previous color to be repeated three times.

Based on these observations, we can deduce that the rule for ""walm"" is a triplication of the color word that precedes it.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeats the color word immediately before it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning: blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green

In all given examples where the word ""dax"" appears, the consistent output is ""green"". This suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input string or the other words present.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, we can infer that individual words map to specific colors and that the appearance of the nonce word 'zup' is consistently followed by the color 'yellow'. Here are the mappings between the given words and colors:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- bluf -> green 
- lug -> blue
- walm -> green or red, depending on the word that precedes it (green if dax precedes walm, and red if wif precedes walm or it occurs at the end of the sequence)

Now let's examine the use of 'zup' across the examples. 

1. In the first example, 'zup' is followed by the output 'yellow' which is then followed by 'dax' which maps to 'green'. Hence, we don't have any particular dependency here.
2. In the second example, 'zup' is at the end of the input and it maps directly to 'yellow'.
3. In the third example, 'zup' appears twice and both times it is followed by 'yellow'. It does not seem dependent on the preceding or following words.
4. In the fourth example, there is 'zup' followed by 'yellow'.
5. In the fifth example, 'zup' is followed by 'yellow'.

Therefore, we can derive the following rule for the word 'zup':

Rule: zup -> yellow

This means 'zup' consistently maps to the color 'yellow', regardless of its position or the context in the sequence.
bluf -> color replication based on the preceding word. Rule:

The word that comes before ""bluf"" determines the color to be reproduced twice in the output. The mappings for the given examples are:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red

When ""bluf"" follows these words, the color associated with the preceding word is produced twice in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the output patterns in relation to the presence of the word ""walm"" in the input.

The first step is observing the output color each time ""walm"" is present in the input:

1. In the first input, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output gives a sequence of three reds (red red red) associated with ""walm lug."" The word ""lug"" alone is translated into blue in other contexts.

2. In the second input, ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" and the output is two blues (blue blue) followed by a single ""lug"" output of blue. 

3. In the third input, there is only one instance of ""walm,"" and it is preceded by ""zup"" and ""bluf lug zup."" The output for ""walm"" in this context is three yellows in a row (yellow yellow yellow).

4. In the fourth input, ""walm"" occurs twice, both times after ""lug,"" and each instance of ""walm"" is followed by three blues (blue blue blue).

5. In the fifth input, ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" and the output is three reds (red red red).

From the above observations, it can be seen that ""walm"" generates a pattern of three colors in the output corresponding to the color that would otherwise be represented by the word preceding ""walm."" For example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""zup"" seems to correspond to yellow.

Rule: When “walm” appears in the input, the output is a repetition of three of the same color that would be represented by the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

So we can infer:

walm -> meaning. Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each example.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently correlates with the output ""green"". Each instance of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to correlate with the color ""red"" as part of its meaning. In instances where ""wif"" appears, the color red is included in the output. Here is the pattern observed:

- wif dax -> red green (wif corresponds to ""red"")
- wif bluf -> red red (""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" likely corresponds to another ""red"")
- wif walm -> red red red (""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" likely corresponds to two instances of ""red"")
- lug zup wif -> blue yellow red (""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red"")

Each time the word ""wif"" is used, the color ""red"" appears in the output. Given that the output varies depending on the other words present, ""wif"" appears to translate consistently to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: Based on the examples provided, whenever the nonce word 'zup' appears in an input, it corresponds to the word 'yellow' in the output.
bluf -> red
Observing the examples, walm consistently leads to a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""lug wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" leads to three occurrences of red (""red red red"").
- In the second example, ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" causes three occurrences of blue (""blue blue blue"").
- In the third example, ""dax walm zup lug,"" ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""walm"" follows suit with three greens (""green green green""), unaffected by the words that follow it.
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" generates three yellows (""yellow yellow yellow"").
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" ""lug"" is blue and ""walm"" repeats the color blue three times (""blue blue blue""), unaffected by the subsequent ""wif lug bluf.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that when ""walm"" follows a word, it causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to that word three times.

Rule: walm -> Triplet repetition of the preceding color.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in all examples provided.
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

Rule: Each nonce word is assigned a specific color. The word ""wif"" means ""red"".
Rule: zup -> yellow

Justification: In each example, the input includes the word ""zup"", and the output always contains the color ""yellow."" Regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input, ""yellow"" is present in the output, which leads us to deduce the rule that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

- In ""lug zup,"" ""lug"" must mean ""blue"" because ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" and the output is ""blue yellow.""
- In ""zup wif bluf,"" since ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" we can deduce that ""wif"" contributes ""red,"" and ""bluf"" contributes another ""red"" to make ""yellow red red.""
- In ""dax wif zup,"" ""dax"" contributes ""green"" to the output, ""wif"" again contributes ""red,"" and ""zup"" contributes ""yellow,"" resulting in ""green red yellow.""
- In ""zup walm wif,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and observing the output ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" ""walm"" must contribute the repeating ""yellow,"" while ""wif"" contributes ""red.""
- In ""zup lug wif,"" we have established that ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" giving the output ""yellow blue red.""

Therefore, zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output features the word ""blue"" in the same position.

Rule: bluf -> blue.
From the provided examples, we can infer the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by examining the patterns of input and corresponding output.

Looking at the outputs, we can notice that ""walm"" seems to correspond to a color, and the specific color it maps to depends on the word that appears immediately before it:

- In the first example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" this suggests that ""walm"" after ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- In the second and third examples, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green,"" this suggests that ""walm"" after ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue,"" this suggests that ""walm"" after ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Given that ""walm"" consistently replicates the color of the word right before it, we can deduce:

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the word preceding it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To determine the meaning of ""lug,"" let's compare the input and output pairs word by word to check the association between the nonce word ""lug"" and the other words present in the input:

1. In the first input-output pair:
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.

2. In the second input-output pair:
   - The word ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue"" and appears twice in the output.

3. For the third input-output pair:
   - The presence of ""lug"" once again corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.

4. In the fourth input-output pair:
   - ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" in the output.

5. Finally, in the fifth input-output pair:
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" which is consistent with the previous pairs.

Considering the above observations, we find that ""lug"" consistently relates to ""blue"" irrespective of its position within the input sequence or the presence of other words.

Rule: lug -> ""blue"".
Based on the given examples, the rule for what ""dax"" means in this context is as follows:

dax -> meaning: the color green

Rule: When the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow irrespective of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond directly to the color that is being attributed to the word immediately preceding it. In each example, the color that is output immediately following ""bluf"" is the same color that is used for the word right before ""bluf"". Here is the breakdown:

- In ""dax bluf wif zup"", ""dax"" results in ""green"", and the word right after ""bluf"" is also ""green"".
- In ""wif bluf"", ""wif"" results in ""red"", and the word right after ""bluf"" is also ""red"".
- In ""zup bluf"", ""zup"" results in ""yellow"", and the word right after ""bluf"" is also ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> meaning: ""Repeat the color associated with the previous word.""

Hence: bluf -> ""Repeat the color of the previous word.""
Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word. 

The examples show that every time ""walm"" is used, the output repeats the color associated with the word that comes before ""walm."" If there is no word before ""walm,"" as in the third example, ""walm"" does not repeat any color and is not represented in the output.

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.

When ""walm"" follows any of these words, the output repeats the color of the word preceding ""walm."" When ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" green is repeated three times. When it comes after ""wif,"" red is repeated three times, and so on. In the case where ""walm"" stands alone (""dax walm""), it simply results in the color green being stated three times without repetition.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Rules:
Based on the input-output examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule that the word ""lug"" represents.

Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
Input: zup dax lug -> Output: yellow green blue
Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue
Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
Input: lug wif -> Output: blue red

Here's what we can extract from the above inputs and outputs:

- Whenever ""lug"" is present, the colour ""blue"" always appears in the output, suggesting that ""lug"" might be represented by the colour ""blue.""

To confirm this hypothesis, let's test it:
- In the first input, ""lug"" is paired with ""wif,"" and the output is ""red blue,"" so ""wif"" could mean ""red.""
- In the second input, ""lug"" follows ""zup dax,"" and the output is ""yellow green blue."" Since ""dax lug"" by itself results in ""green blue,"" ""zup"" could mean ""yellow"" and ""dax"" could mean ""green""; ""lug"" again is represented by ""blue.""
- The fourth input is more complex with different words, but ""lug"" matches ""blue"" while the other pairs seem consistent with previous outputs (e.g., ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red"").

Based on this, the rule seems to be quite straightforward:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green. Rule: The word dax corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that ""wif"" consistently leads to the output ""red"" regardless of its position within the input sequence. Thus, the meaning of ""wif"" seems to be independent of other words and simply translates to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow.
Based on the examples given, we can start by breaking down each input with its corresponding output to find a pattern:

1. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
2. ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" -> ""red green red red yellow red""
3. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
4. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
5. ""zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow yellow blue""

Here's what we can deduce:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" there is no direct example, but we can ignore this as we have enough consistency by looking at the first three points.

From the information given, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. Therefore:

Rule: bluf -> The output color of ""bluf"" matches the output color of the word immediately before it.
walm -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the word 'walm' repeatedly translates to a series of 'blue' that is as long as the series of colors preceding it. So, 'walm' seems to stand for a replicative function where the color preceding 'walm' is repeated a number of times equal to the total count of colors that appear before 'walm' in the sequence.

Rule: ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the immediately preceding color, replicating it as many times as the total number of distinct colors that appear before it in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in every example provided.
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""dax."" Let's try to analyze the patterns:

Input: dax
Output: green
- Here ""dax"" directly translates to ""green.""

Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green
- Here ""zup"" might be associated with ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" might mean ""green green.""

Input: lug dax
Output: blue green
- Here ""lug"" might be associated with ""blue,"" and we know ""dax"" is ""green.""

Input: dax wif zup
Output: green red yellow
- Here ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" might still be ""yellow,"" thus ""wif"" could be ""red.""

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- Here we can infer that ""bluf"" might mean ""green"" since we know the output for ""dax"" already.

Based on these observations, here is the rule I deduced:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Other words might correspond to other colors, but in these examples, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red. Each occurrence of ""wif"" in the input results in the color red in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
Rule: bluf -> blue
walm -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to three instances of the color red. Each occurrence of ""walm"" in the input translates to ""red red red"" in the output.

Rule: ""walm"" indicates a sequence of three reds.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

The consistent presence of the word ""blue"" in the output whenever ""lug"" appears in the input indicates that ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
Based on the provided examples, we can infer that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" In every example given, an instance of ""dax"" yields the output ""green,"" regardless of the surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: zup corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" signifies a repetition of the color associated with the directly preceding word. Here's the pattern observed in each example:

- In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and the corresponding output for ""dax"" is green, so ""bluf"" results in ""green.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" twice and the output for ""zup"" is yellow, so ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" both times.
- In the third example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for ""wif"" is red, so ""bluf"" results in ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" once and the output for ""dax"" is green, so ""bluf"" results in ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" once and the output for ""zup"" is yellow, so ""bluf"" results in ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word immediately before it.
Rule: walm -> green if the previous word is 'dax', and red if not.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

In each example, the presence of the word ""lug"" correlates with the output ""blue.""
Based upon the information provided in the examples, we can induce the following meanings for the word ""dax"":

Rule: dax -> green

This is evident because whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" invariably follows in the output, irrespective of its position or the presence of other words.
Rule: wif -> red

Each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context in which it appears. This rule holds true across all provided examples.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we look for patterns in the examples provided:

1. When ""zup"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output color associated with ""bluf"" is yellow. 
   - ""zup dax bluf"" -> yellow green green
   - ""zup bluf lug zup"" -> yellow yellow blue yellow
   - ""zup bluf"" -> yellow yellow

2. When ""dax"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output color associated with ""bluf"" is green.
   - ""dax zup bluf"" -> green yellow yellow
   - ""dax bluf zup"" -> green green yellow

3. ""bluf"" is never the first word, so we cannot determine its color without a preceding word. 

4. The color associated with ""bluf"" does not seem to be affected by any words following it but only by the word directly before it.

From these patterns, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is dependent on the word immediately preceding it. If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output color for ""bluf"" is yellow. If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output color for ""bluf"" is green.

Therefore: bluf -> If preceded by ""zup,"" bluf means yellow; if preceded by ""dax,"" bluf means green.
Based on the examples given, each utterance of a word corresponds to a color, with ""walm"" resulting in a repetition of a color. The specific rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color associated with the word before it a number of times equal to the number of letters in the word that precedes ""walm."" To break down each example:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and since ""lug"" has three letters, ""walm"" repeats the word ""blue"" three times.
- ""wif lug walm"" outputs ""red blue blue blue."" ""Wif"" is ""red"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" Since ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and has three letters, ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- ""wif walm"" gives ""red red red."" Here, ""wif"" is the word before ""walm"" and it has three letters, so ""red"" is repeated three times.
- ""lug walm zup wif"" turns into ""blue blue blue yellow red."" ""Lug"" is before ""walm,"" so ""blue"" is repeated three times. ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red"" (these words are not followed by ""walm,"" so there's no repetition).
- ""dax wif walm"" results in ""green red red red."" ""Dax"" is associated with ""green,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which has three letters, hence ""red"" is repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to be repeated a number of times equal to the number of letters in the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds directly to the color ""blue"" in the outputs, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples:

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"".
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""walm"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" when not preceded directly by ""dax"", but ""green"" when it is.
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" appears to modify the color word following it to ""green"", or represents the color ""green"" when it stands alone.

Thus, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""dax"" -> turns the following color word into ""green"", and if there is no color word following, it is ""green"" by itself.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" correlates with the output color ""red."" Each occurrence of ""wif"" in the input examples results in ""red"" appearing in the corresponding position in the output. No other correlations between ""wif"" and contextual elements like its place in the sequence or the words around it indicate a different meaning. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it seems clear that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow."" There does not appear to be any contextual variation that changes the meaning of ""zup"" within the given examples. Therefore, I deduce the rule as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Regardless of the context in the provided examples, ""zup"" always translates to the color ""yellow.""
Rule: bluf corresponds to the color that completes a symmetric color pattern. If we consider the first color to be on the far left and the last one to be on the far right, bluf is the color that would be needed to make the pattern symmetric from left to right. 

For example, in the first input, the colors are blue (lug), red (wif), and green (dax) before bluf, and after bluf, we have red (wif), and blue (lug), which makes a symmetrical pattern: blue-red-green-red-blue. Hence, bluf is green in this case to complete the symmetry.

Bluf -> The color necessary to create a symmetrical pattern in the sequence of colors.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided. Each example contains the word ""walm"" and a sequence of colors in the output. I will analyze the position of ""walm"" in each input as well as the colors that follow it in the output to find a rule.

Examining the inputs alongside their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
   - ""dax"" correlates with the first green, ""walm"" seems to correlate with the following green colors, and ""lug"" correlates with blue.

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" correlates with yellow, and ""walm"" seems to correlate with the following yellow colors.

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" correlates with yellow, ""wif"" with the first red, and ""walm"" with the following red colors.

4. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   - Following the previous pattern, ""zup"" correlates with yellow, ""wif"" with red, ""dax"" with green, and ""walm"" again seems to be associated with a continuation of the color that precedes it, followed by ""lug"" which is always blue.

5. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   - The pattern holds with ""zup,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug."" However, ""walm"" comes before ""lug"" and after ""dax,"" and the color green continues. ""wif"" is at the end and corresponds to red.

From this, we can deduce a tentative rule for ""walm"":
- ""walm"" seems to indicate a repeating sequence of the color word that immediately precedes it, up until either the sentence ends or a new color word is introduced.

Rule: walm -> continue the preceding color in sequence until a new color name appears or the sequence ends.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
