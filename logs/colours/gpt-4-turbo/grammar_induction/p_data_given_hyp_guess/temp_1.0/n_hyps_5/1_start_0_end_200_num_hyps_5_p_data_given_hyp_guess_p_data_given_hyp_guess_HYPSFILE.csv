"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" serves as a rule that translates to the color red, under current context. However, it is not clear whether ""wif"" by itself always maps to red or if its translation to red is conditional based on other words present in the input.

Looking at the examples:

- In the first example, both ""wif"" and ""walm"" translate to red, while ""dax"" translates to green.
- In the second example, ""dax"" translates to green again, ""bluf"" translates to green as well, ""lug"" translates to blue, and ""wif"" translates to red.
- In the third example, without the presence of ""dax"" or any other words that were provided with colors, ""wif"" retains its translation to red, just like ""walm.""
- In the fourth example, the presence of ""zup"" introduces a new color, yellow, while ""wif walm"" remains red red red.
- In the last example, ""dax wif"" translates to green red, which is consistent with the pattern observed before, where ""dax"" is associated with green and ""wif"" with red.

Given the consistency across the examples, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red regardless of its position in the input string.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,0,wif
"wif -> meaning. Meaning appears to be the color red. Rule: Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is ""red"".",1.0,0,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif"", we need to analyze the examples given and find the common rule that applies to each occurrence of the word ""wif"".

Let's look at each input and output:

1. Input: dax wif walm | Output: green red red red
2. Input: dax bluf wif lug | Output: green green red blue
3. Input: wif walm | Output: red red red
4. Input: wif walm zup | Output: red red red yellow
5. Input: dax wif | Output: green red

Considering that the inputs involving “wif” consistently have an output where “red” follows the occurrence of “wif,” it suggests that “wif” dictates the color “red.” The presence of other words after ""wif"" does not change this, as ""walm"" and ""lug"" in the presence of ""wif"" both lead to ""red"". When ""wif"" is at the beginning or the middle of the sequence, the following word is associated with ""red"". Additionally, when ""wif"" is at the end, there is no word following it, but it still results in ""red"". Also, note that “dax” leads to “green,” and other words, such as ""zup,"" lead to different colors like “yellow,” so “wif” does not mean “green” or “yellow”.

If we follow this pattern, we can induce the rule:

Rule: wif -> The next word, or the absence of a next word after ""wif"", corresponds to the color “red”. If there is no word after ""wif"", it still results in ""red"".",1.0,0,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" I will examine the output colors linked to each input phrase with and without the word ""wif"". The color outputs are green, red, blue, and yellow, which in this context seem tied to specific rules or conditions related to the input words.

- When ""wif"" is followed by the word ""walm,"" the output is always red red red, regardless of whether it starts with ""dax"" or not: 
  - Input: ""dax wif walm"" -> Output: green red red red
  - Input: ""wif walm"" -> Output: red red red

- When ""wif"" is present without ""walm,"" it seems that ""wif"" outputs a single red:
  - Input: ""dax wif"" -> Output: green red

- When ""wif"" is followed by a word that has not been directly linked to a particular color, such as ""lug,"" there is a single red for ""wif"" and then a subsequent color that presumably corresponds to the unknown word:
  - Input: ""dax bluf wif lug"" -> Output: green green red blue
  - Here ""bluf"" is followed by green and ""lug"" is followed by blue; ""wif,"" as before, is red.

- When ""wif"" precedes an unknown word (""lug"" excluded since it followed ""wif"" previously) like ""zup,"" it seems to behave the same way—yielding red for ""wif"" and a new color for the new word:
  - Input: ""wif walm zup"" -> Output: red red red yellow

Therefore, based on this analysis where ""wif"" consistently results in the color red, either once or thrice when followed by ""walm,"" the rule for ""wif"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: The term ""wif"" translates to a single red output when used in a phrase. If it is immediately followed by the word ""walm,"" the output is three reds in a row. The presence of the word ""dax"" at the beginning does not appear to change the ""wif"" rule but contributes its color, which is green.

So, wif -> meaning: In this system, ""wif"" corresponds to the output of red. If ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" the result is triply red.",0.9,0,wif
"From examining the given examples, we can infer a rule about the meaning of ""wif."" Let's look at the patterns:

- When ""wif"" is immediately followed by ""walm,"" the output is always ""red red red,"" regardless of what comes before or after.
- When ""wif"" is not immediately followed by ""walm,"" but is in the sentence, it results in ""red.""
- The word after ""wif"" affects the color output immediately after the ""red"" that corresponds to ""wif.""

Based on these observations, it appears that ""wif"" itself corresponds to a single ""red"" in the output sequence. Additionally, when it is directly followed by ""walm,"" ""walm"" also corresponds to ""red."" However, the presence of ""wif"" does not seem to affect the color outputs of words that are not immediately after it unless it's specifically ""walm.""

To summarize, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to ""red"" in the output. When ""wif"" is followed by the word ""walm,"" ""walm"" also translates to ""red"" for each occurrence.

Thus, wif -> red.",0.8,0,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,0,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" represents the color ""yellow"" in the given examples, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,0,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" represents the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,0,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the given outputs.",1.0,0,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color output that changes depending on the previous word in the input sequence. Specifically, ""bluf"" changes to a color that corresponds to the color of the word preceding it:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is green (as ""dax"" maps to green).
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is blue (as ""lug"" maps to blue).
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is yellow (as ""zup"" maps to yellow).
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" we do not have a direct example, but based on its usage elsewhere (""wif"" -> red), it's reasonable to deduce the output would be red.

From this, we can derive the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> the color output corresponding to the color of the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".",1.0,0,bluf
"Reviewing the examples, it looks like each nonce word (dax, zup, lug, bluf, wif) corresponds to a color based on the output provided. Let's try to determine the rule for what bluf means by looking at the patterns before and after bluf in the input and comparing it to the output.

Here are the inputs and outputs with a focus on bluf:

1. dax zup bluf
   green yellow yellow
2. zup bluf lug zup
   yellow yellow blue yellow
3. dax bluf zup
   green green yellow
4. lug bluf dax bluf
   blue blue green green
5. zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   yellow yellow red green red yellow

Now, let's identify which color each nonce word corresponds to based on the repeated patterns:

- ""dax"" seems to consistently correspond to green.
- ""zup"" seems to consistently correspond to yellow.
- ""lug"" seems to consistently correspond to blue.
- ""wif"" seems to consistently correspond to red.

Given this, the color for ""bluf"" needs to be determined. We can see from examples 1, 2, and 3 that bluf takes the same color as the word right before it (examples 1 and 3: dax is green, so bluf is green; example 2: zup is yellow, so bluf is yellow). Additionally, in example 4, both occurrences of bluf follow the color of the preceding word: lug is blue, so bluf is blue; dax is green, so the second bluf is green.

From these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf takes the color of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.

Thus:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the color of the previous word. ",1.0,0,bluf
"To induce the rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the provided examples and outputs:

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Input: zup bluf lug zup
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow

Input: dax bluf zup
Output: green green yellow

Input: lug bluf dax bluf
Output: blue blue green green

Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow

Based on the examples, it seems that ""bluf"" might represent the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. To confirm the rule, let's examine each instance:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" which matches the output for ""zup.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" again, and its output is once more ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and its output is ""green,"" which matches ""dax.""
- In the fourth example, there are two instances of ""bluf""; both times ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and ""dax,"" respectively, and each time the output matches the color of the preceding word (""blue"" for ""lug"" and ""green"" for ""dax"").
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" again and its output is ""yellow,"" consistent with previous examples.

From these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

**Rule**: The word ""bluf"" represents the color output associated with the word that precedes it.

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"":

bluf -> The color associated with the word immediately before it.",1.0,0,bluf
"To induce the rule for what ""bluf"" means, look for patterns in the color outputs immediately following the word ""bluf"" in the inputs. Here are the given examples restated with the immediate outputs after ""bluf"" highlighted:

Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow **yellow**
Input: zup bluf lug zup -> Output: yellow **yellow** blue yellow
Input: dax bluf zup -> Output: green **green** yellow
Input: lug bluf dax bluf -> Output: blue **blue** green **green**
Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> Output: yellow **yellow** red green red yellow

From these examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" reflects the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Therefore:

bluf -> Reflects the color of the preceding word.",1.0,0,bluf
"From the given examples, we can observe that the output colors correspond to certain words in the input, with ""bluf"" being one of these words. Let's analyze the patterns:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and since ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in the second ""yellow"", we might infer that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- However, in the second example, ""bluf"" once again outputs ""yellow"", but it is followed by ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue"". This indicates the meaning of ""bluf"" might be based on its position rather than its association with the word that comes after it.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" outputs ""green"" this time, which is the same color that corresponds to ""dax"". This might be due to ""bluf"" being between two instances of ""dax"".
- The fourth example shows ""bluf"" between two ""lug"" words, each translating to ""blue"", and in the output, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue"".
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is between ""zup"" and ""wif"". ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". This time ""bluf"" once again outputs ""yellow"".

The pattern suggests that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that appears before it. If ""bluf"" is the first word, it defaults to ""yellow"".

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word; defaults to yellow if it is the first word.",0.8,0,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Here is the reasoning:

1. Whenever ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
2. Whenever ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""
3. Whenever ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" or ""zup"" is present in the sequence after ""walm,"" the output includes a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" followed by a sequence of ""yellow.""

From this, we can infer that ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word and continues the pattern until another non-""walm"" word appears.

Rule: walm -> a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""walm,"" continuing until disrupted by a different word.",1.0,0,walm
"Observing the input-output pairs, it seems that ""walm"" consistently leads to the color ""green"" being repeated in the output one more time after its first appearance. Here is the breakdown:

1. lug dax walm -> blue green green green
After ""dax,"" ""green"" is outputted and then repeated three times, including the repetition for ""walm.""

2. lug walm wif zup wif -> blue blue blue red yellow red
The color ""blue"" is repeated twice after ""lug,"" and once after ""walm,"" suggesting ""walm"" again causes a single repetition of the previous color.

3. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow
The color ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup,"" is repeated twice after the appearance of ""walm.""

4. lug walm zup lug zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
""Blue,"" which corresponds to ""lug,"" is repeated once after ""walm,"" then the sequence continues as expected.

5. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow
Here, ""green"" follows ""dax"" and is then repeated twice overall, with one repetition attributable to ""walm.""

Based on the patterns, the rule seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the sequence, it causes the previous color output to be repeated one additional time.

So, if the previous word resulted in ""X"" color, then after ""walm,"" ""X"" will be repeated once more before continuing with the rest of the sequence.

Thus: walm -> Causes the previous color to be repeated once.",1.0,0,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the commonalities among the outputs each time the word ""walm"" appears in the input.

Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green

Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow

From these examples, we can observe that the word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated; when it follows ""dax,"" the color ""green"" is repeated; and when it follows ""wif,"" we see a repetition of ""red"" before a different word appears. The repetition continues until a new non-""walm"" word appears.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color output associated with the word preceding it until a new distinct word is introduced.",1.0,0,walm
"To determine the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to analyze the input and output sequences to see how ""walm"" affects the resulting colors.

- When ""lug dax walm"" is inputted, the output is ""blue green green green."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" gives ""green,"" it appears that ""walm"" might be generating additional ""green"" after ""dax"".
- In the input ""lug walm wif zup wif,"" the output is ""blue blue blue red yellow red."" Here, ""lug"" results in ""blue"" and we see ""walm"" has produced two additional ""blue"" outputs after ""lug"". ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" does not seem to interact with these.
- Given the input ""wif dax zup walm,"" the output is ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""Walm"" follows ""zup"" and more ""yellow"" is repeated.
- For ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" the output ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"" demonstrates that after ""lug,"" ""walm"" outputs additional ""blue,"" and no extra color is added after ""zup"" (""yellow"").
- Lastly, the input ""dax walm zup"" results in ""green green green yellow."" ""Dax"" maps to ""green,"" and ""walm"" seems to repeat ""green"" before ""zup,"" which maps to ""yellow.""

From this analysis, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color represented by the word immediately preceding it. Since ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" after ""lug""; since ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""walm"" repeats ""green"" after ""dax"". It seems that ""walm"" does not repeat the color of ""zup"".

Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""walm,"" except if the preceding word is ""zup"".",0.8,0,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns:

1. Whenever ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" ""dax,"" or ""wif,"" the output is repeated threes of the color that corresponds to the preceding word.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green.""
   - However, ""walm"" followed by ""wif"" does not follow this pattern as we see only two instances of ""red"" for ""wif.""

2. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is triple ""yellow"" which corresponds to ""zup.""

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be: when ""walm"" follows a word, the output color corresponds to three times the color of the word before it except when it is ""wif"" or in the case of the second position in output (e.g., first example, ""lug dax walm""), where ""walm"" takes the color of the word right before it for the second position, and then follows the tripling pattern.

However, considering the examples provided, it is not entirely clear why ""wif walm"" doesn't yield ""red red red,"" and with the given data, I can't confidently deduce the role of ""walm"" in this specific case. Additionally, there might be exceptions or additional rules governing ""walm's"" behavior that aren't captured in the examples given. 

Rule: walm -> repeats the corresponding color output of the preceding word three times, with some exceptions or additional context-specific behavior that isn't fully explained by the examples provided.",0.7,0,walm

When we have ""bluf"" in the input, the output color is the color that directly precedes ""bluf"" in the input, and that color appears twice in a row in the output. Let's validate this rule with the given examples:

bluf -> the same color as the preceding word, effectively duplicating the color output.",1.0,1,bluf
"Analyzing the examples provided:

1. Input: wif zup bluf
   Output: red yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Since ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is an additional ""yellow,"" it's possible that ""bluf"" means ""repeat the previous color.""

2. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red
   - Following the same potential rule from example 1, ""bluf"" at the end of the sequence after ""wif"" results in an additional ""red."" This supports the ""repeat the previous color"" hypothesis.

3. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   - Again, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is an additional ""green,"" which aligns with the repeat rule.

4. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
   Output: blue green green red green
   - The sequence ""lug dax bluf"" results in ""blue green green."" Here ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" with the corresponding ""green"" repeated. This continues to support the repeat rule.

5. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   - The simple sequence of ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green,"" with ""bluf"" obviously causing the ""green"" to repeat.

Given the above examples, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the previous color mentioned.

Rule: If the word before ""bluf"" corresponds to a color in the output, then ""bluf"" causes that color to be repeated in the output immediately after the corresponding color for the preceding word.",1.0,1,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to function as an instruction to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. This can be deduced from observing that the output always consists of three instances of the color that corresponds to the word directly before ""walm"", followed by the color(s) represented by any words that come after ""walm"". 

For example, in the first input ""zup walm wif"", ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and it is followed by ""walm"", which leads to the repetition ""yellow yellow yellow"" in the output before the final word ""wif"" which is represented by the color red.

Therefore, the rule for walm is:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,1,walm
"Rule: walm -> the previous word repeated three times.

Explanation: 
- In the first input ""zup walm wif,"" the output shows ""yellow yellow yellow"" before showing the color for ""wif,"" which is red. This indicates that ""walm"" has caused ""zup"" to repeat three times.
- The second input ""lug walm dax"" follows the same pattern, with ""blue blue blue"" for ""lug"" before ""green"" for ""dax.""
- The third input ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" again repeating the color for ""wif"" three times.
- The fourth and fifth inputs also follow the same pattern, indicating that ""walm"" causes the previous word to be outputted three times in a row in the respective color before continuing with the next words.",1.0,1,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" is an instruction to repeat the color associated with the word preceding it three times in the output. Here's the rule inferred from the examples:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

We can see this in the provided examples:

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm,"" the word ""yellow"" is repeated three times before moving on to the next word ""wif,"" which corresponds to red.
- In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm,"" the word ""blue"" is repeated three times before moving on to ""dax,"" which corresponds to green.
- The third example shows ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after ""walm,"" the word ""red"" is repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" to blue, and ""zup"" to yellow. The sequence follows the color association and repeats ""blue"" three times after ""walm.""
- The fifth example is similar, with ""zup"" corresponding to yellow (repeated three times), followed by ""dax"" (green) and ""lug"" (blue).

So, in summary:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,1,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. The amount of repetition appears to be threefold. Here is how the rule applies to each input:

- ""zup walm wif"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" where ""yellow"" is repeated three times after ""zup,"" followed by the color associated with ""wif"" (red).
- ""lug walm dax"" leads to ""blue blue blue green,"" where ""blue"" is repeated three times after ""lug,"" followed by the color associated with ""dax"" (green).
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" where ""red"" is repeated three times after ""wif.""
- ""dax lug walm zup wif"" leads to ""green blue blue blue yellow red,"" where ""blue"" is repeated three times after ""lug,"" with the other colors following their respective words.
- ""zup walm dax lug"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue,"" where ""yellow"" is repeated three times after ""zup,"" followed by the color associated with ""dax"" (green) and the color associated with ""lug"" (blue).

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, replicate the output color associated with that word three times. If another color word follows ""walm,"" continue with the output as usual with the color associated with the following word.

Consequently:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,2,zup
"Based on the examples provided, ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow every time it appears in an input. It does not seem to have a position-dependent meaning; regardless of where it appears in the sequence, the output is consistently yellow. Therefore:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,2,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,2,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow'. Here's how the rule is deduced:

- In every example where 'zup' is included, the output always contains the word 'yellow'.
- The position of 'zup' in the input does not change the output color; it's always 'yellow', regardless of where 'zup' appears in the sequence.

Thus, the rule is as follows:

"bluf -> red

"Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be consistently translated to the color ""red"". In each instance where ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output features ""red"" repeated twice. There are no examples where ""bluf"" leads to a different color or a different number of repetitions.

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" based on the given examples is as follows:

Rule: bluf -> red,1.0,2,bluf

"Based on the given examples, it appears that each word translates to a color:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- walm -> red

It is noted that ""bluf"" always translates to ""red red,"" suggesting that the word ""bluf"" induces a repetition of the color word preceding it. However, in the third example, ""zup bluf wif walm,"" the pattern does not hold, as ""bluf"" does not repeat ""yellow"" but instead follows it by repeating ""red"" twice after ""wif"" being translated to ""red.""

Given this, the most sensible rule that fits all examples is:

bluf -> Repeat the previous color again.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color word preceding it.",0.8,2,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first look at each instance where it occurs in the input and the corresponding output to find patterns.

1. ""dax walm zup walm"" 
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

2. ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" 
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

3. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" 
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

4. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" 
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

5. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" 
   Output: green green green red blue green green green

It appears that the word ""walm"" causes the color before it to repeat itself three times in the output. In each example, the color that immediately precedes ""walm"" is tripled. 

Knowing this, we can propose the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word that comes immediately before ""walm"" three times in the output.",1.0,2,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns and the corresponding outputs.

1. In every instance where ""walm"" appears, it is followed by repeated colors in the outputs. So, ""walm"" seems to be associated with the duplication or repetition of a certain color.

2. The color that is repeated corresponds to the preceding word:

   - When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the color green is repeated.
   - When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the color blue is repeated.
   - When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the color yellow is repeated.
  
3. It also seems that ""walm"" alone doesn't have a color, but rather it influences the color that comes before it. We can tell because there is no new color introduced immediately after ""walm,"" only a repetition of the preceding color (in a series of three).

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rule:

**Rule:** The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Therefore, walm -> causes the preceding color to be repeated three times.",1.0,2,walm
"Rule: The word 'walm' causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times.

Explanation:

- In the first example, 'dax' is green, and 'zup' is yellow. When 'walm' follows 'dax', it becomes green three times. When 'walm' follows 'zup', it becomes yellow three times.

- In the second example, 'lug' is blue, 'wif' is red, and 'zup' is yellow. 'Walm' after 'lug' results in blue being repeated three times. 'Walm' after 'zup' results in yellow being repeated three times.

- In the third example, again, 'lug' associates with blue and 'wif' with red, 'zup' with yellow. Each instance of 'walm' causes the preceding color to be repeated three times.

- The fourth and fifth examples follow the same pattern, confirming the rule.

So:

walm -> Causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times.
",1.0,2,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can compare the patterns of inputs and outputs and identify a rule that applies consistently across the examples. Let's examine the appearances of ""walm"" and their corresponding outputs:

1. dax walm zup walm -> green green green yellow yellow yellow
   - Here, after ""dax"" and ""zup,"" ""walm"" yields three colors: ""green"" after ""dax,"" and ""yellow"" after ""zup.""

2. lug wif lug walm zup walm wif -> blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   - After ""lug,"" ""walm"" yields three ""blue"" and after ""zup,"" three ""yellow.""

3. lug walm wif zup wif -> blue blue blue red yellow red
   - Following ""lug,"" we have three ""blue"" for ""walm.""

4. zup walm dax zup dax wif -> yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   - ""Walm"" gives us three ""yellow"" after ""zup"" and here we can also see that ""walm"" is not present after ""dax.""

5. dax walm wif lug dax walm -> green green green red blue green green green
   - After ""dax,"" the ""walm"" appears to produce three ""green.""

From these patterns, it seems that ""walm"" causes a repeating pattern of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. Specifically, ""walm"" after ""dax"" produces ""green"" three times, ""walm"" after ""lug"" produces ""blue"" three times, and ""walm"" after ""zup"" produces ""yellow"" three times.

Rule: The word ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word before it three times. If ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green repeated three times. If ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is blue repeated three times. If ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is yellow repeated three times. 

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.",1.0,2,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns before and after it appears in the examples provided:

1. dax walm -> green green green
2. lug walm -> blue blue blue
3. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

From these, we can theorize a rule: The word ""walm"" causes the word that appears just before it to be repeated three times in the output color.

Now checking the remaining parts of the examples:

4. walm zup -> yellow yellow yellow
5. walm wif -> red

The rule appears to hold true for zup followed by walm, but ""walm wif"" produces a single red, which does not follow the same pattern of triplet repetition. 
However, if we look at other instances where ""wif"" appears following another word (lug wif, zup wif, dax wif), it results in a single instance of ""red"". 

From these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" when placed after another word causes the output to be three repetitions of the color mapping to that prior word, except when followed by ""wif"" which results in a single instance of the color mapping to ""wif"" (red).

Thus, 
walm -> causes the previous word's corresponding color to be repeated thrice, unless the following word is ""wif"", in which case ""wif"" determines the color (red) and it is not repeated.",0.9,2,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the outputs. Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" is in the corresponding position in the output.",1.0,3,lug
"Rule: ""lug"" seems to mean ""blue,"" as each instance of ""lug"" in the inputs corresponds directly to ""blue"" in the outputs.

Explanation:
- In the first input example, ""dax lug bluf"" translates to ""green blue blue,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to the second ""blue.""
- In the second input, ""lug"" appears twice and corresponds to two instances of ""blue"" in ""blue blue blue,"" followed by ""walm,"" which appears twice and translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" implying that ""walm"" means ""yellow.""
- The third input has ""lug"" near the end, translating to ""blue"" again, which matches with the prior rule identified.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" is again translated to ""blue,"" consistent with previous examples.
- The fifth input also confirms that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

lug -> blue",1.0,3,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: dax lug bluf
   Output: green blue blue
   - Here, ""dax"" corresponds to 'green'.
   - ""lug"" precedes a 'blue'.

2. Input: lug walm zup walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""lug"" is followed by three 'blue'.
   - ""walm"" corresponds to 'yellow' and the 'yellow' is repeated twice for a single occurrence of ""walm"".

3. Input: zup bluf lug dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue green blue
   - ""zup"" and ""bluf"" both appear before ""lug"" and correspond to 'yellow' and 'blue' respectively.
   - ""lug"" appears twice and is followed by 'blue' each time, despite what precedes it.

4. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
   Output: green green red blue yellow
   - ""lug"" is preceded here by ""wif"" which corresponds to 'red', but as per previous examples, ""lug"" is followed by a blue, regardless of the preceding color.

5. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""lug"" is followed by 'blue', the same outcome as in other examples.

Based on these examples, we can deduce a rule that ""lug"" corresponds to 'blue', and this color assignment is consistent irrespective of the context it appears in.

Rule:
lug -> blue",1.0,3,lug
"To determine the meaning of ""lug,"" we must examine the examples and their outcomes. We can start by looking for patterns before and after the word ""lug"" in the input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: dax lug bluf
   Output: green blue blue

2. Input: lug walm zup walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: zup bluf lug dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue green blue

4. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
   Output: green green red blue yellow

5. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

Now let's analyze the patterns:

- When ""lug"" appears after ""dax,"" ""blue"" follows ""green"" in the output.
- When ""lug"" appears on its own at the start of a sequence, it translates to ""blue,"" as seen in examples 2 and 3.
- When ""lug"" appears after ""wif,"" ""blue"" follows ""red"" in the output.
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""dax,"" ""green"" follows ""blue"" in the output, but ""lug"" itself translates to ""blue.""
- When ""lug"" appears between other colors, it always translates to ""blue.""

Given these patterns, each instance of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input or the context around it. This suggests that ""lug"" consistently means ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,3,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that 'lug' translates to the color 'blue.' Additionally, each word appears to correspond to a color, and each color is repeated in the output a number of times corresponding to the number of syllables in the word. Here's the breakdown:

- ""dax lug bluf"" -> green (1 syllable, hence repeated once) blue (1 syllable) blue (1 syllable)
- ""lug walm zup walm"" -> blue (1 syllable) blue blue (since 'walm' is likely 2 syllables, hence repeated twice) yellow yellow yellow (3 syllables)
- ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" -> yellow yellow (2 syllables) blue (1 syllable) green (1 syllable) blue (1 syllable)
- ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" -> green (1 syllable) green (1 syllable as 'bluf') red (1 syllable) blue (1 syllable) yellow (2 syllables)
- ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" -> red (1 syllable) yellow yellow (2 syllables) blue (1 syllable) green (1 syllable for 'dax') yellow yellow yellow ('zup' and 'walm' with 2 and 3 syllables, respectively)

Rule: lug -> blue. The number of times a color is repeated in the output corresponds to the number of syllables in the input word associated with that color.",1.0,3,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the output associated with ""dax"" is always ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. No matter if it's at the beginning, middle, or end of the sequence, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"".

Here's the logical deduction from the given examples:
- ""zup dax walm"" outputs ""yellow green green green"", where ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green"".
- ""lug dax"" outputs ""blue green"", where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- ""dax"" on its own outputs ""green"".
- ""dax zup"" outputs ""green yellow"", where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- ""zup dax"" outputs ""yellow green"", where again ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

From these observations, the rule can be formulated as:

"From the provided examples, each instance of the word ""wif"" results in the output ""red.""

Despite the presence and position of other nonce words, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,3,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to look at the instances where it is used and the corresponding output.

From the examples given, every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output. There is a direct mapping between ""wif"" and ""red,"" which is consistent in all examples provided. Therefore, wif corresponds to red.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,3,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can observe the following:

1. Each instance of ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""
2. ""walm"" and ""dax"" both consistently correspond to ""red.""
3. ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""
4. ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue.""

However, there is an anomaly in the output colors for ""bluf"":

- In the last example, ""bluf"" corresponds to a sequence of three ""blue,"" which does not align with any prior output responses for other words. 

Given the consistency of the colors for other words, we might deduce that ""bluf"" is a unique case and one interpretation could be that it means to repeat the previous color stated, which in this case is ""blue."" So ""bluf"" would generate three ""blue"" outputs in this context.

Yet, since there's only one instance of ""bluf"" and it's occurrence results in a triple repetition of the color ""blue,"" we lack sufficient data to confirm a pattern or a solid rule for the nonce word ""bluf.""

However, we have enough context to deduce the meaning of ""wif"" - it consistently maps to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,3,wif

Based on this, it seems that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the previous color mentioned—three times by default, four times if the previous word is ""wif.""

Walm -> meaning. Rule: Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word, three times as a standard or four times if the preceding word is ""wif"".",1.0,3,walm
"Based on the given examples, ""walm"" appears to be associated with a repeating pattern of color words. The color that is repeated corresponds to the word that appears immediately before ""walm."" Here is the observed pattern:

- ""lug wif walm"" outputs ""blue red red red."" This suggests that ""wif"" correlates with the color red, and ""walm"" causes the previous color word (red, in this case) to repeat three times.
- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green."" Here ""dax"" correlates with the color green, and ""walm"" causes the previous color word (green, in this case) to repeat three times.
- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow."" This suggests that ""zup"" correlates with the color yellow, and ""walm"" causes the previous color word (yellow, in this case) to repeat three times.
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" outputs ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue."" Here, ""lug"" still correlates with blue, and ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to repeat three times.
- ""dax wif walm"" outputs ""green red red red."" This shows that regardless of the color that comes first in the sequence (""dax"" correlating with green), ""walm"" makes the immediate previous color word (red in this case, correlated with ""wif"") repeat three times.

Based on the observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" is a rule that enforces the repetition of the immediately preceding color word three times.

Rule: walm -> Causes the immediate preceding color word to repeat three times.",1.0,3,walm
"walm -> meaning. Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the preceding nonce word multiple times. The number of repetitions of the color is equal to the number of letters in the preceding nonce word.

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and ""wif"" has three letters, so ""walm"" leads to ""red red red.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and ""dax"" has three letters, so ""walm"" leads to ""green green green.""
- In the third example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""zup"" has three letters, so ""walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the fourth example, each nonce word has an associated color, and ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the nonce word just before it (""lug"" -> blue), which has three letters, resulting in ""blue blue blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""wif"" to red; since ""wif"" is immediately before ""walm"" and has three letters, ""walm"" leads to ""red red red.""",1.0,3,walm
"Walm -> meaning. Rule: The word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it, repeating three times. 

- ""lug wif walm"" outputs ""blue red red red"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" makes it repeat three times.
- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" makes it repeat three times.
- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" makes it repeat three times.
- In a sequence, ""walm"" still applies to the immediately preceding word. For ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug,"" we have ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"" for ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and then ""dax lug"" is ""green blue"" at the end, without a ""walm"" to cause repetition of the color corresponding to ""dax.""

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,4,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" is used in the input, the color green is produced in the output sequence. Other words like ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""bluf"" correspond to other colors (""yellow,"" ""blue,"" and ""blue"" respectively). Hence, the word ""dax"" does not seem to change its meaning based on context in this limited set of examples.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,4,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following pattern in the occurrences of the nonce word ""dax"" and its corresponding output:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears after ""zup,"" ""zup bluf dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow green.""
2. Whenever ""dax"" occurs after ""bluf,"" such as ""bluf dax,"" it translates to ""blue green.""
3. When ""dax"" leads the sequence or is followed by another word that is not ""zup"" or ""bluf,"" it translates to ""green.""

Now, not every occurrence of ""dax"" consistently leads to a matching colour output, suggesting that its meaning may not be tied to one specific colour. However, based on the output whenever ""dax"" is present, ""dax"" itself always yields ""green"" regardless of its position or the words around it.

Given this, we can propose the following rule:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" always translates to the colour ""green.""",1.0,4,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to analyze common patterns in the examples provided:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the word ""green"" is in the corresponding position in the output.
- ""dax"" does not change its output based on position; it consistently maps to ""green.""

Given the consistent one-to-one correspondence between the occurrences of ""dax"" in the input and the word ""green"" in the output, we infer the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,4,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" translates differently depending on the context. Here is the rule derived from the examples:

dax -> green when it is followed by a word.
dax -> yellow when it is preceded and followed by the word ""zup"".

Rule: If ""dax"" is surrounded by ""zup"" on both sides, then it means yellow. In all other contexts, ""dax"" means green.",1.0,4,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the patterns in the given examples.

In the first example:
Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow

Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" The word ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" in both instances.

In the second example:
Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green

Here, ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow."" The word ""dax"" precedes a sequence of ""green"" colors, which continues with ""walm.""

In the third example:
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Without ""zup,"" the sequence still starts with ""green"" and continues with ""green"" after ""walm.""

In the fourth example:
Input: dax zup lug
Output: green yellow blue

Here, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"" once again, with ""dax"" leading to a ""green.""

In the fifth example:
Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Even though ""bluf"" corresponded to ""blue"" in the first example, after ""dax,"" it translates to ""green"" here.

From this analysis, it appears that ""dax"" initiates a change to ""green,"" and in the case that ""dax"" precedes another word, that word also corresponds to ""green,"" regardless of previous color associations. The effect of ""dax"" seems to persist until another word with a known color association (like ""zup"") appears, resetting the sequence back to the original color association.

Rule: dax -> changes the following color(s) to green until a reset word with a known color association appears.",0.9,4,dax

- dax bluf wif zup lug -> green green red yellow blue
- dax wif zup dax -> green red yellow green
- lug walm dax wif lug wif -> blue blue blue green red blue red
- wif lug -> red blue

When ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red."" There is only one example where ""wif"" is not followed by ""lug"" (the third example), in which it is still followed by ""red.""

"Based on the examples provided, it's possible to deduce that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each instance of ""zup"" in the input results in ""yellow"" in the output.

- ""zup"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red yellow,"" suggesting that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in this instance.

Input: lug wif zup wif

- ""zup"" appears in a sequence with ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and another ""wif."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" in this context also outputs ""yellow.""

Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow
- Looking at the sequence, ""dax"" and ""walm"" both correspond to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" which leaves ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf corresponds to repeating the color of the word that immediately precedes it.,1.0,4,bluf
"Inspecting the input-output pairs, we can infer the following associations for non-""walm"" words:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue

Now, analyzing the outputs in relation to the position and occurrence of ""walm"" within the inputs allows us to deduce a pattern:

- When ""walm"" follows a word, the output color is a repetition of the last color listed three times.

Therefore, we can conclude the following:

Rule: walm -> replicate the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.",1.0,4,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" appears to correspond to the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word, for three times.

Similarly, ""dax"" is associated with green, so ""walm"" following ""dax"" leads to ""green green green.""

Hence:
walm -> Repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, for three times.",1.0,4,walm
"walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears after another word, the color associated with the previous word is outputted three times.

If ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" associated with yellow, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".",1.0,4,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word the same number of times as the total number of words preceding walm in the input.

"Observing the patterns, it seems that the appearance of ""walm"" in the input corresponds to a repetition of the color that immediately precedes it in the output. 

For instance: 

- In ""dax walm zup walm"", ""dax"" results in ""green"" and ""walm"" results in ""green green"". Then ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"", followed by ""walm"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow"". 
- Similarly, in ""dax lug wif walm"", we have ""dax"" leading to ""green"", then ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and finally ""walm"" that repeats the color red, resulting in ""red red red"".
- The input ""dax lug walm"" has ""dax"" leading to the output ""green"", then ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeats this color, leading to ""blue blue blue"".

Based on these observations, the rule could be articulated as:

Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each Output. Therefore, ""lug"" means ""blue.""",1.0,5,lug
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs across the examples to identify patterns:

1. Input: dax walm wif walm zup

   - ""dax"" is followed by ""green""
   - ""walm"" is followed by ""green""
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""red""

2. Input: dax lug

   - ""dax"" is followed by ""green""
   - ""lug"" is followed by ""blue""

3. Input: wif dax zup wif
   Output: red green yellow red
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""red""
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""green""
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow""

4. Input: zup dax lug dax
   Output: yellow green blue green
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""green""
   - ""lug"" is followed by ""blue""
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" again

5. Input: wif dax zup dax
   Output: red green yellow green
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""red""
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""green""
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" again

From these patterns, we can infer that whenever ""dax"" appears in the input sequence, it always corresponds with the output ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,5,dax
"To determine the rule for ""dax,"" let's analyze each input and corresponding output pair:

1. **Input:** dax walm wif walm zup
   **Output:** green green green red red red yellow
   - The occurrence of 'dax' leads to 'green,' 'walm' following 'dax' is also 'green,' but this does not hold for the subsequent 'walm,' which leads to 'red.' 'Wif' leads to 'red' and 'zup' to 'yellow.'

2. **Input:** dax lug
   **Output:** green blue
   - 'Dax' appears at the beginning and translates to 'green,' and 'lug' translates to 'blue.'

3. **Input:** wif dax zup wif
   **Output:** red green yellow red
   - 'Wif' corresponds to 'red,' 'dax' to 'green,' 'zup' to 'yellow,' and 'wif' again to 'red.'

4. **Input:** zup dax lug dax
   **Output:** yellow green blue green
   - 'Zup' corresponds to 'yellow,' 'dax' to 'green,' 'lug' to 'blue,' followed by another 'dax' which again corresponds to 'green.'

5. **Input:** wif dax zup dax
   **Output:** red green yellow green
   - 'Wif' corresponds to 'red,' 'dax' to 'green,' 'zup' to 'yellow,' and the subsequent 'dax' again corresponds to 'green.'

From these examples, we can induce the following rule:

- Whenever 'dax' appears, regardless of its position in the sequence or what comes before or after it, the output is consistently 'green.'

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> meaning. Meaning: 'dax' means 'green'. Rule: In any given sequence, 'dax' translates to the color 'green'.",1.0,5,dax
"Observing the examples provided, the following patterns can be deduced for each input associated with their respective output:

- walm -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red

The word ""dax"" appears in each series of inputs and is always followed by ""green"" in the output, no matter the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence. Therefore, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds directly to the color ""green.""

Given this information, we can express the rule as follows:
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the output.",1.0,5,dax
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we first look for patterns between the input sequences and their corresponding output sequences.

- In the first input ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" the word ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green"" in the output.
- In the second input ""dax lug,"" ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green"" again.
- In the third input ""wif dax zup wif,"" the word ""dax"" corresponds to the second word in the output, which is ""green.""
- In the fourth input ""zup dax lug dax,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in both the second and the fourth positions.
- Finally, in the fifth input ""wif dax zup dax,"" ""dax"" once again corresponds to ""green"" in both the second and fourth positions.

From these examples, we can deduce that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. There doesn't appear to be a dependency on position or surrounding words since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" regardless of its location in the sequence or the words that come before or after it.

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output sequence.

Thus: dax -> green.",1.0,5,dax
"To deduce the meaning or rule for the word ""dax"", we can analyze the patterns in the given examples.

From the first example, we notice that every time the word ""walm"" appears, the output is ""green"", and ""zup"" results in ""red red yellow"". So ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" separately corresponds to ""red red yellow"".

In the second example, we see that ""dax lug"" outputs ""green blue"". Since we do not know what ""lug"" means on its own, we cannot derive the specific meaning for ""dax"" from this example alone.

The third example gives ""wif dax zup wif"" as an input with the output ""red green yellow red"". We have ""wif"" at the beginning and the end, producing ""red"". This means that ""dax"" and ""zup"" are producing ""green yellow"".

The fourth and fifth examples provide more insight, showing that ""dax"" appears multiple times with the consistent result of producing ""green"".

By now we can see a consistent pattern: whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"". 

So, we can deduce:

dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".",0.9,5,dax
Rule: wif corresponds to the color red.,1.0,5,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs carefully: 

1. The sequence ""wif zup wif"" translates to ""red yellow red,"" which suggests that ""wif"" could mean ""red.""
2. However, it seems that the ""wif"" at the end of ""lug walm wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red yellow red,"" with ""wif"" possibly contributing to the ""red"" part, as seen previously.
3. In ""wif dax zup walm,"" ""wif"" precedes the sequence and translates to ""red,"" supporting the idea that ""wif"" means ""red.""
4. Again, in ""dax zup walm wif walm,"" the ""wif"" before the last ""walm"" translates to ""red,"" and the ""walm"" after it is repeated as ""red"" more than once, yielding ""yellow yellow yellow red red red,"" which suggests that ""wif"" might cause the next color word to repeat.
5. In ""wif lug zup,"" ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" which translates alone to ""blue,"" but here it turns into ""red blue yellow.""
6. Lastly, ""wif lug"" confirms that it translates to ""red blue,"" suggesting that ""wif"" stands for ""red"" when it comes before other color words.

Based on these observations, the consistent translation for ""wif,"" regardless of position, is that it translates to ""red."" It also appears to make the following color word repeat in its sequence when it is not the last word.

Rule: wif -> red. When ""wif"" appears before another color word and is not at the end of a sequence, it causes the next color to be repeated in the sequence.",0.9,5,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. ""walm"" always results in ""yellow.""
2. ""lug"" always results in ""blue.""
3. ""zup"" always results in ""yellow"" except when it immediately follows ""wif,"" in which case it results in ""red.""
4. ""dax"" always results in ""green.""
5. The instances of ""wif"" seem to be followed by ""red,"" except when it precedes ""zup,"" in which case it is ""red"" but also changes the following ""zup"" to ""red.""

Given these patterns, the rule for ""wif"" seems to modify the following color except when it is before ""zup,"" in which not only does the ""wif"" correspond to ""red,"" but it also changes ""zup"" to ""red."" Since there is no pattern of ""wif"" being followed by any other word or at the end of a sequence, we cannot confidently deduce what ""wif"" means in other contexts. However, when followed by ""lug,"" it is associated with ""red"" before ""blue"" from ""lug.""

Rule: wif -> ""red"" before another color, potentially modifying the following word if it is ""zup"" to also result in ""red.""",0.9,5,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we should look at its corresponding outputs in each example:

- In example 1, ""wif"" is followed by a ""red.""
- In example 2, ""wif"" at the beginning of the sequence results in a ""red.""
- In example 3, ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" results in ""red red red,"" suggesting ""wif"" might be multiplying the effects of ""walm.""
- In example 4, ""wif"" at the start followed by ""lug"" results in ""red blue.""
- In example 5, ""wif"" followed by ""lug"" results in ""red blue.""

From these examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" generally corresponds to the color ""red."" However, in example 3, it seems to duplicate the color produced by ""walm"" which is yellow, resulting in three ""red"" instead of one. If we were to follow this pattern, the placeholder ""wif"" could suggest a repeating or intensifying function of the subsequent color output. But we have too few examples to conclude that it always has a duplicating effect or if it just intensifies ""walm"" specifically.

Nevertheless, the clearest pattern is that regardless of where ""wif"" appears or what follows it, it results in ""red."" Thus, we can propose:

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red"" (with a potential additional effect of repeating or intensifying the output connected to ""walm"").",0.8,5,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look for patterns in the input-output pairs.

1. Whenever ""wif"" appears alone followed by another nonce word (e.g., lug, dax), the output is ""red"" followed by another color (e.g., blue for lug, green for dax):

   - ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
   - ""wif dax"" as part of ""wif dax zup walm"" -> ""red green ...""

2. If ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"" (which always corresponds to ""yellow""), it generates an alternating pattern starting with ""red"":

   - ""lug walm wif zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue red yellow red""
   - ""wif dax zup walm"" includes ""zup walm"" after ""wif"" - the pattern ""yellow yellow"" starts after the initial ""red""
   - ""dax zup walm wif walm"" includes ""wif walm"" after ""zup"" - and the pattern ""yellow red"" repeats three times after one ""yellow""

3. When ""wif"" appears towards the end of the input sequence, it generates multiple ""red"" outputs:

   - ""wif lug"" ends with ""lug"" -> ""red blue""
   - ""wif dax zup walm"" ends with ""walm"" -> ""red green yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""dax zup walm wif walm"" has ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""

Without further contrasting examples where ""wif"" doesn't lead to these patterns, it's challenging to determine an exact rule. However, from the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" and it may have an effect on the following words, especially seen when it appears before ""zup.""

From the data given, we can stipulate the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red,"" and when followed by ""zup,"" it creates a pattern that starts with ""red"" and alternates with the color corresponding to the word after ""zup."" Also, ""wif"" seems to have a multiplicative effect toward the end, influencing the number of times the color that follows it is repeated; further examples would be required to refine this rule.",0.7,5,wif

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the non-word ""bluf"" is consistently translated to the color ""red."" Each example shows that when ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Additionally, it does not seem to matter where ""bluf"" appears in the sentence; its presence always results in ""red."" Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

bluf -> red

Rule: Whenever ""bluf"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is ""red.""",1.0,5,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,1.0,5,bluf
"Rule:

"Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each occurrence of ""bluf"" in the inputs aligns consistently with the output ""red"". Therefore, ""bluf"" -> ""red"".",1.0,5,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, let's analyze the commonality when the word `bluf` appears and its corresponding output in color.

1. wif zup bluf wif dax -> red yellow yellow red green
2. zup bluf wif lug dax -> yellow yellow red blue green
3. wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> red red yellow red blue green
4. dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red
5. dax wif bluf -> green red red

By examining the instances, we can observe how ""bluf"" is translated:

- In examples 1 and 3, `bluf` comes after `zup` (yellow) and the corresponding color for `bluf` is also yellow.
- In examples 2, 4, 5, `wif` comes before `bluf` and the corresponding color for `bluf` is red.
- Example 2 has `zup` preceding `bluf` (as in examples 1 and 3), but `wif` is right before `bluf`, giving it the color red, as seen in examples 4 and 5.

It seems that the presence of the word ""bluf"" leads to an output that does not correspond to a consistent color, but rather depends on the preceding word(s). However, given that the word ""wif"" directly precedes ""bluf"" in every example except for the first one and consistently results in the color ""red"", we might deduce that ""wif"" has an influence on the color ""bluf"" produces.

If we focus solely on the word ""bluf"" and not on other words around it, from these examples, the rule is not consistent enough to determine what ""bluf"" means on its own. Nevertheless, focusing on the pattern when ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", there's a consistent association with the color ""red"".

Rule: When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"", it corresponds to the color ""red."" However, it's important to note that without more examples where ""bluf"" is not preceded by ""wif"", it's not possible to definitively conclude the meaning or rule behind ""bluf"" in isolation.",0.8,5,bluf
"Based on the patterns observed in the examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" leads to a repetition in output of the color that immediately precedes it. To elaborate:

- In the first example, ""zup dax lug walm zup"", the color before ""walm"" is ""blue"" (associated with ""lug""), and the output is ""blue blue blue"" immediately after ""walm"".
- In the second example, ""lug walm"", again ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"", and ""walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"".
- For the third and fourth examples, the pattern holds true as well, with repeated colors (associated with the word prior to ""walm"") in groups of three, following the word ""walm"".

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it instructs to repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,5,walm

"Based on the series of inputs and outputs provided, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the repetition of the color prior to its placement in the sequence.

Here are the observations from each input/output pair:

1. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"", and the color blue, which corresponds to ""lug,"" is repeated after ""walm.""

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"", and again the color blue is repeated twice after ""walm.""

3. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"", and the color red is repeated twice after the first ""walm."" The second ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" and the color yellow is repeated twice.

4. Input: dax zup walm wif walm

   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"", and the color yellow is repeated twice.

From these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" is presented in a sequence, the output color of the word that precedes ""walm"" is repeated three times total, including the original instance.

"Based on the provided examples, each instance of the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the English color ""green."" Below is an analysis of each input and output pairing that supports this conclusion:

- ""lug dax walm wif"" corresponds to ""blue green green green red.""

""dax"" appears amid these known colors and outputs ""green.""
- ""dax lug wif"" corresponds to ""green blue red,"" providing further evidence that ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""dax"" is situated where ""green"" appears.
- ""dax zup lug bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow blue blue."" ""Zup"" as mentioned is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" ""Bluf"" seems to be a variation or misspelling of ""blue,"" so it also corresponds to ""blue,"" leaving ""dax"" corresponding to ""green.""
- ""wif dax wif lug wif"" corresponds to ""red green red blue red,"" reinforcing that ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""lug"" is ""blue,"" with ""dax"" being the only remaining word, corresponding to ""green.""

Based on this analysis, the rule is:

"Based on the given examples, each nonce word (zup, lug, wif, bluf, dax) corresponds to a color. To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the consistent result in every output whenever ""dax"" appears in the input:

- No other word consistently results in ""green"" in the output when ""dax"" is present.

Therefore, it can be concluded that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,6,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" corresponds to a specific color output in the pattern. The color that ""dax"" corresponds to is ""green,"" as it is consistent in all the given examples. Here is the rule based on the examples:

"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the pattern of colors that appear in the output corresponding to the presence of ""zup"" in the inputs:

- When ""zup"" appears before ""lug"" (""zup lug""), the output is ""yellow blue.""
- When it appears before ""dax"" (""zup dax""), the output is ""yellow green.""
- When it appears alone or at the beginning of a sequence, such as ""zup dax lug walm"" or ""zup walm dax lug,"" the output starts with ""yellow"" followed by colors that are not directly related to it appearing before other words.
- When ""zup"" appears in the middle of a sequence without a specific word after it, as in ""lug zup lug,"" the output is the color ""yellow"" in the place where ""zup"" is.

Based on the above observations, it seems that ""zup"" does not have a fixed color associated with it but always translates to ""yellow"" in the output sequence. The word that comes after ""zup"" determines the next color in the sequence. If there is no word directly associated with ""zup,"" then it simply results in ""yellow.""

Therefore, we can deduce:

Input: zup lug walm

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""  
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""  
- ""walm"" corresponds to blue repeated three times 

Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when it is placed before ""lug""  
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""  
- ""walm"" still corresponds to blue repeated three times  
- The second instance of ""zup"" also corresponds to ""yellow"" before ""lug""

Input: zup dax  
Output: yellow green  
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""  
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Input: lug zup lug  
Output: blue yellow blue

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when it follows ""lug""

Input: zup walm dax lug

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""  
- ""walm"" normally corresponds to blue repeated three times, but here it seems to give ""yellow"" directly after ""zup""  
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""  
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

From the above observations, it seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow."" There is no context in which ""zup"" changes its output; the presence of ""zup"" does not appear to modify the outputs of ""dax,"" ""lug,"" or ""walm."" It does not seem dependent on position relative to the other words either, since it retains its meaning regardless of being at the beginning, middle, or end of a sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow. ""Zup"" means ""yellow.""",1.0,6,zup
"Based on the examples provided where the word ""zup"" appears, it seems that ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow"". Every time we see ""zup"" in the input, there is a corresponding ""yellow"" in the output sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,6,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" precedes a list of colors, each of which is represented by a subsequent nonce word. The specific color associated with each nonce word is deduced from the pattern of inputs and outputs:

- ""lug"" is consistently followed by the word ""blue""
- ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow"" or ""blue"", but always ""yellow"" when proceeded by ""zup""
- ""dax"" is followed by ""green""

What's interesting is that ""zup"" itself appears to be associated with the color ""yellow"" since it precedes ""yellow"" in the output every time it is used. Additionally, it seems to function as a reset for the color sequence, particularly when looking at the example ""zup lug walm zup lug"" which translates to ""yellow blue blue blue yellow blue"", where ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow"" and then restarts the sequence.

So the rule is: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" and seems to indicate a sequence reset or starter in terms of generating an output sequence of colors.

Rule: zup -> yellow",0.9,6,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" seems to serve as an indicator for changing the color word that follows it to yellow, regardless of what the original color word is. Essentially, every instance where ""zup"" precedes another word, that word's corresponding color is replaced with yellow in the output.

Here's the breakdown of the rule application:

1. In ""zup lug walm,"" the words following ""zup"" are ""lug"" and ""walm,"" which correspond to the colors blue and blue, respectively. However, because they follow ""zup,"" both are changed to yellow, resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow blue.""

2. In the second example, ""zup dax lug walm zup lug,"" ""dax"" and ""lug"" that follow the first ""zup"" are changed to yellow, and ""lug"" that follows the second ""zup"" is also changed to yellow. ""walm"" is left as blue because it doesn't follow a ""zup.""

3. ""zup dax"" simply turns ""dax,"" which would otherwise be green, to yellow due to the presence of ""zup.""

4. In ""lug zup lug,"" the first ""lug"" is untouched because it precedes ""zup,"" so it remains blue. The ""lug"" following ""zup"" turns yellow for the reason stated above.

5. Lastly, ""zup walm dax lug"" turns ""walm,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" all to yellow due to their position following ""zup,"" until there are no more colors following a ""zup,"" hence the last ""lug"" remains blue.

Therefore, the rule is:
zup -> The word immediately following ""zup"" should be output as yellow, regardless of its original color association. If there are multiple words following ""zup"" without interruption by another ""zup,"" they all turn yellow. The effect of ""zup"" is reset once another ""zup"" appears or the sequence ends. 

However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the first and last examples:

- In ""zup lug walm,"" it should follow the rule and output ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" but the given output is ""yellow blue blue blue,"" which breaks with the established rule. 
- In ""zup walm dax lug,"" following the rule, it should be ""yellow yellow yellow green blue,"" but the given output is ""yellow yellow yellow green blue,"" which also seems inconsistent. 

To provide a corrected rule, it's important to account for these details. The rule might have exceptions or additional conditions that are not apparent from the examples given. Therefore, the rule above is the best fit based on the information provided, but the examples do suggest there might be errors or further complexity to the rule that hasn't been disclosed.",0.0,6,zup
"Rule: bluf -> red when following the word ""wif"", green otherwise.",1.0,6,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following rules for the other words:

- wif always corresponds to red.
- dax always corresponds to green.
- lug always corresponds to blue.

Now, let's look specifically at the occurrences of the word bluf and the corresponding output colors:

- wif dax bluf -> red green green; the color green appears, but it can't be from bluf because dax already represents green.
- lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> blue red green green red blue; again, the sequence green green occurs after dax.
- dax zup lug zup bluf -> green yellow blue yellow yellow; yellow appears twice, following zup. bluf is not blue because that's lug, nor is it green or yellow.
- wif bluf lug -> red red blue; bluf corresponds to red here, preceding the blue result from lug.
- wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> red red green green red red red blue red; the first bluf results in red following wif, and the second bluf results in green following dax. We see that bluf seems to replicate the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it.

Given this information:

bluf seems to take on the color of the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> Takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. If wif is before bluf, the output is red. If dax is before bluf, the output is green. If lug is before bluf, an output was not directly given, but the rule should still follow that bluf takes on the color of lug, which is blue. If zup is before bluf, an output was not given, but again, the rule should be that bluf would take on the color of zup, which seems to be yellow.",1.0,6,bluf
"Analyzing the examples given, it becomes evident that each ""bluf"" is associated with a specific color. However, the color represented by ""bluf"" is not constant throughout the examples; rather, it seems context dependent. If we look at the outputs corresponding to each occurrence of ""bluf,"" we notice that the color which follows ""bluf"" is identical to the color that precedes it. Here is how ""bluf"" correlates with the provided input and output pairs:

- In ""wif dax bluf"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""green,"" and ""dax"" is represented as ""green.""
- In ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"", ""bluf"" is again followed by ""green,"" the color associated with ""dax.""
- In ""dax zup lug zup bluf"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow,"" and ""zup"" is represented as ""yellow.""
- In ""wif bluf lug"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""red,"" the color associated with ""wif.""
- In ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"", ""bluf"" is first followed by ""green"" (the color associated with ""dax"") and the second time, it is followed by ""red"" (the color associated with ""wif"").

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.",1.0,6,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Based on the pattern from the examples, the word ""bluf"" always translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words. Therefore, the rule is that ""bluf"" consistently means ""green"". Rule: bluf means green.",1.0,6,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red."" However, we can also see the repetition of ""bluf"" leads to different colors being produced. This suggests that ""bluf"" may change its meaning based on its position or other words around it. 

Let's attempt to analyze the given examples:

Example 1: 
Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green
- Since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" in this context also means ""green.""

Example 2: 
Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
Output: blue red green green red blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" Since ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" again, it also means ""green"" in this context.

Example 3: 
Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The ""bluf"" here follows a ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow.""

Example 4:
Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The ""bluf"" here, following a ""wif,"" also means ""red.""

Example 5:
Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""red"" as well. ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" and ""dax,"" giving us ""red"" and ""green,"" respectively, which suggests that ""bluf"" might take the color of the word that precedes it. 

From the analysis, it seems that ""bluf"" might take the color value of the word that comes directly before it. This would account for both occurrences where ""wif"" and ""dax"" preceded ""bluf"" which resulted in ""red"" and ""green"" respectively.

So we can deduce the rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word that precedes it in the sequence.",0.8,6,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs with the outputs:

1. Input: lug walm wif – Output: blue blue blue red
2. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif – Output: red red green green red red red blue red
3. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf – Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
4. Input: dax walm wif bluf – Output: green green green red red
5. Input: lug wif walm – Output: blue red red red

From these examples, let's analyze the position and effect of the word ""walm"":

- After ""lug,"" ""walm"" results in an additional ""blue"" (example 1 and 3).
- After ""dax,"" ""walm"" results in an additional ""green"" (example 4).
- After ""wif,"" ""walm"" results in an additional ""red"" (example 1 and 5).
- ""Walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Based on the observations, ""walm"" appears to repeat the output color of the word before it. Each input word seems to be associated with a specific color: ""lug"" with blue, ""wif"" with red, ""dax"" with green, and ""zup"" with yellow.

Rule: walm -> repeats the output color of the previous word.",1.0,6,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer a pattern for the color associated with each word by comparing the input and output. Here are the patterns:

- In every output, ""blue"" appears before ""red.""
- ""Wif"" is consistent and always corresponds to ""red.""
- ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" when it precedes ""walm"" and ""red"" when it follows ""walm.""
- ""Walm"" outcomes always follow a ""blue"" and precede ""red.""

Given the examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it generates the color that comes immediately after ""blue"" and before ""red"" within a sequence, which in the outputs provided, is consistently ""red."" In addition, ""walm"" never appears at the beginning of an input, which means there is always a ""blue"" preceding it.

Based on this information, we can state the following rule:

Rule: walm -> When preceded by ""lug"" (and thus ""blue""), ""walm"" changes the subsequent outputs to ""red.""

Given this, ""walm"" seems to act as a transition word from ""blue"" to ""red"" when following ""lug.""",0.9,6,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the inputs and outputs:

1. ""lug walm wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red.""
2. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" translates to ""red red green green red red red blue red.""
3. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red.""
4. ""dax walm wif bluf"" translates to ""green green green red red.""
5. ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red.""

First, let's identify each unique word and its corresponding color:
- lug: blue
- wif: red
- bluf: green
- zup: yellow
- dax: green (not a typo; ""dax"" and ""bluf"" produce the same color)

Now we analyze the pattern for ""walm"":
- In the first example, inserting ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in a repetition of ""blue"" before switching to ""red."" This suggests that ""walm"" is related to a repetition of the previously mentioned color.
- In the second example, the presence of ""walm"" after a series of other colors results in ""blue,"" which is the color assigned to ""lug,"" which is right after ""walm,"" then returns to ""red,"" which is the color of ""wif"" that comes next.
- In the third example, ""walm"" again follows ""zup"" and we see a repetition of ""yellow"" before it changes to ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, there is a repetition of ""green"" until ""walm"" leads to a change to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" precedes ""wif"" and ""walm,"" resulting in ""blue red red red,"" where the ""red"" is repeated three times.

It seems that ""walm"" signals a shift in color sequence where it repeats the last color just mentioned in the previous word before ""walm"", but then follows it with the color of the word that comes immediately after it.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be this: Put the color of the word that precedes ""walm"" once, followed by the color of the word that immediately follows ""walm"" repeating three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word once, followed by the color of the succeeding word three times.",0.8,6,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at each example input and its corresponding output to determine the underlying pattern. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red

From this example, whenever we see 'lug' we can deduce it maps to 'blue', and 'wif' maps to 'red'. The repetition of 'blue' suggests that 'walm' could match 'lug' or cause repetition.

2. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red

In this example, 'wif' maps to 'red' consistently. 'Bluf' seems to correspond to 'green'. We can further deduce that 'dax' is likely to map to 'green'. Before and after 'walm', we have 'wif' mapping to 'red', but right before 'lug', which we know maps to 'blue'.

3. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

Here 'zup' maps to 'yellow', and again 'lug' maps to 'blue' and 'wif' to 'red', while 'bluf' maps to 'red'. 'Walm' is followed by repeated 'yellow', similar to the first example where 'walm' was followed by repeated 'blue'.

4. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

'Dax' corresponds with 'green', and as earlier, 'wif' corresponds with 'red' and now 'bluf' also corresponds with 'red'.

5. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red

In this example, 'lug' corresponds with 'blue' and 'wif' with the first 'red'. The 'walm' here again is followed by 'red'.

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word 'walm' causes the word immediately preceding it to be repeated in the output until a different color-word is encountered.

Thus:

walm -> The color-word before 'walm' repeats.",0.8,6,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs.

1. Input: lug walm wif — Output: blue blue blue red
   Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif — Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   Here, the output ""blue"" follows the word ""walm"" when ""lug"" precedes it. Looking at the second input-output pair, the word ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" and the corresponding output is ""blue"" once again. This possibly suggests that the presence of ""lug"" either before or after ""walm"" causes the output to be ""blue.""

2. Input: zup walm lug wif — Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red 
   Here, ""lug"" follows the word ""walm"" and ""blue"" is in the output, but ""yellow"" is on both sides of ""walm lug,"" suggesting ""zup"" might influence the repetition of ""yellow.""

3. Input: dax walm wif — Output: green green green red 
   The pattern of the output ""green"" repeated three times might correspond to ""dax,"" and ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" and ""red."" This strengthens the idea that ""walm"" followed by ""wif"" gives the output of ""red.""

4. Input: lug wif walm — Output: blue red red red
   The presence of ""lug"" gives ""blue,"" and ""wif walm"" is followed by ""red red,"" once again supporting the rule that ""walm"" followed by ""wif"" leads to ""red.""

Given the pattern, it seems that ""walm"" takes the color of the word that follows it. We have instances where ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" yielding ""blue,"" followed by ""wif"" giving ""red,"" and in the absence of any specific word after ""walm,"" it seems to default to ""red.""

"Based on the input and output pairs provided, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Each time ""lug"" is inputted, ""blue"" appears in the output. Let's summarize what we observe:

Input: lug wif lug bluf
Output: blue red blue blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and appears twice, similar to the output.

Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
Output: yellow yellow red blue green
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" again.

Input: dax lug wif
Output: green blue red
- ""lug"" is in between ""dax"" and ""wif,"" corresponding to ""blue"" positioned between ""green"" and ""red"" in the output.

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,7,lug
"Reviewing the provided examples, we can hypothesize the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" by correlating its usage with the output produced in each instance.

- In the first example, ""lug wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue blue"". The word ""lug"" appears twice and corresponds to the color ""blue"" in both instances.
- In the second example, ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow red blue green"", where ""lug"" appears once and translates to ""blue"".
- In the third example, ""dax lug wif"" translates to ""green blue red"", with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"".
- In the fourth example, ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow"", with ""lug"" translating to ""blue"".
- In the fifth example, ""zup walm dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue"", with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"".

In each example, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"". Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

However, the word ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red,"" no matter its position in the list.

2. When combined with other nonce words, ""wif"" seems to maintain its translation as ""red"".
3. The sequences involving ""wif"" don't seem to have an impact on the translation of ""wif"" to ""red"", regardless of their position in the sequence.

"bluf -> red when immediately following ""wif"", yellow when immediately following ""zup"". Otherwise, the meaning of ""bluf"" is not directly indicated by these examples and seems to depend on the preceding word in the phrase. Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.",0.8,7,bluf
"By analyzing the examples given, we may notice the patterns preceding and succeeding the nonce word ""walm"", as well as the corresponding color outputs.

In the given examples:

1. ""dax walm zup"" results in ""green green green yellow""
2. ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue""
3. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""
4. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue red green""
5. ""zup walm lug wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red""

We can start by isolating what we know:

- ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green"", as it always results in a ""green"" output when it precedes other words.
- ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue"", given its consistent output across combinations.
- ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow"", which is consistent when it precedes other words, except in the last example.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" when it follows other words.

Now, let's focus on instances with ""walm"":

- In example 1 and 2, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes either ""zup"" or ""lug"", and the word following ""walm"" always takes a color that corresponds with it. The color after ""walm"" doesn't match ""walm"", suggesting that ""walm"" doesn't necessarily mirror the word that follows.
- In example 3, ""walm"" is immediately after ""lug"" and corresponds to ""blue blue blue"", corroborating that ""lug"" relates to ""blue"" but not indicating what ""walm"" contributes specifically.
- In example 4, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif dax"". We know ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", but there is an additional ""blue"" here (since we know ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""). This suggests that ""walm"" in this context results in ""blue"".
- In example 5, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" and before ""lug"", and instead of ""yellow blue red"", we see ""yellow yellow yellow"", indicating that ""walm"" in this case is responsible for repeating the color output of ""zup"" twice.

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" affects or repeats the color output of the word that precedes it. This rule is consistent in all examples where ""walm"" always results in a repetition of the color corresponding to the previous word, with a direct repetition in case of colors besides ""yellow"", and a triple repetition if preceded by ""yellow"".

Rule: walm -> A word that causes the color output corresponding to the previous word to be repeated. If preceded by ""yellow"", the effect is a triple repetition; otherwise, it is a direct repetition.",0.8,7,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the commonalities and differences between each example.

1. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow
2. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
3. lug walm -> blue blue blue
4. zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green
5. zup walm lug wif -> yellow yellow yellow blue red

The first observation is that when ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the result is consistently ""blue blue blue,"" as seen in examples 3 and part of 4. In example 2, ""lug walm"" also results in ""blue blue,"" which follows the same pattern.

The second observation is that ""wif"" leads to a ""red"" output (examples 4 and 5). However, ""walm"" does not precede or follow ""wif,"" so it does not help us determine the rule for ""walm"" directly.

The third observation is that when ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output contains ""green green"" in both examples 1 and 2. In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and is followed by ""wif dax,"" resulting in ""blue red green,"" with ""green"" again following ""dax.""

The fourth observation is that ""zup"" produces ""yellow."" In examples 1 and 5, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and in both cases, the output for ""zup"" and ""walm"" is the same color. In example 4, ""zup"" precedes ""lug"" and the result is ""yellow blue,"" here ""lug"" changes the pattern but without enough data to understand how.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" could be influenced by the word immediately preceding it. Considering the examples given, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The output color for ""walm"" matches the output color for the word immediately preceding it.

Using this rule, the meaning of ""walm"" would be akin to an echo or mimic of the color indicated by the previous word.

walm -> meaning: walm takes on the color output of the word immediately before it.",0.8,7,walm
"Based on the examples given, the word ""walm"" appears to be a repeatable modifier that changes the color associated with the word immediately following it to the color that is associated with that word if ""walm"" was not present.

Here are the patterns observed:

- ""dax walm zup"" yields green green green yellow, where ""dax"" is green, ""walm"" seems to have no color, and ""zup"" is yellow. However, there's an extra green which suggests that ""walm"" might cause repetition or duplication.
- ""dax lug walm"" yields green blue blue blue, where ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, and following ""walm,"" there's a repetition of blue.
- ""lug walm"" yields blue blue blue, with ""lug"" being blue and then two additional blues follow, indicating a repeated effect.
- ""zup lug walm wif dax"" yields yellow blue blue blue red green where ""zup"" is yellow, ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" repeats the blue, ""wif"" is red, and ""dax"" is green. This supports the repeat effect where ""walm"" is causing the color of ""lug"" to repeat before moving on to ""wif.""
- Finally, ""zup walm lug wif"" gives us yellow yellow yellow blue red, where ""zup"" is yellow, ""walm"" causes it to repeat based on previous logic, ""lug"" is blue, and ""wif"" is red.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color output of the word that follows it twice, making the total number of times the color appears to be three.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the next word to repeat twice.",0.8,7,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the provided examples, we need to analyze the patterns and correlations between the input strings and their corresponding outputs.

Let's examine the given examples:

1. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

4. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

5. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

Now, let's analyze these examples in detail:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (Example 1), the output is ""green green"".
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (Examples 2 and 3), the output is ""blue blue"".
- When ""walm"" is between ""zup"" and ""lug"" (Example 5), the output is ""yellow yellow"".
- When ""walm"" precedes ""wif"" and follows ""lug"" (Example 5), the output is ""yellow"".

Based on these patterns, it appears that ""walm"" may not have a single fixed meaning or color association but rather it may reflect the color of the word that follows or precedes it, with some transformation rule.

Observing the transformation:

- ""dax"" is associated with green, ""lug"" with blue, and ""zup"" with yellow.
- When ""walm"" appears after these words, it repeats their associated color once or twice.
- ""walm"" seems to take on the color of the word after it, repeating the color in the output.

Given this information, and the fact that the outputs involve repeating colors (except for the case with ""wif"" which does not seem to have enough examples to establish a clear rule), the meaning or rule for ""walm"" could be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" takes on the color associated with the next word in the sequence and repeats it. If followed by ""wif"", it does not clearly repeat but rather only reflects the associated color once.

""walm"" -> meaning: Repeats the color association of the following word, except maybe when followed by ""wif"".",0.7,7,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should cross-reference each instance where the word ""walm"" is used and analyze the output colors related to them.

Let's look at each instance:

1. ""dax walm zup"" results in ""green green green yellow""
2. ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue""
3. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""
4. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue red green""
5. ""zup walm lug wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red""

When examining outputs where ""walm"" is used, we see that after its occurrence, all following colors are blue except if interrupted by another noun that has its corresponding color associated.

Examples:
- ""lug walm"" has ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""lug"" and ""walm"" result in blue and that ""walm"" continues to cause subsequent words (or at least the absence of words with their own color coding) to turn blue.
- In ""dax lug walm,"" ""walm"" causes all following terms to turn blue again, which fits our hypothesis.
- If ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" (as in ""zup walm lug""), the color is yellow instead of blue, which deviates from the pattern but happens only once at the beginning of the given text.

The rule for ""walm"" influencing the colors of the words after it is consistent except for when ""walm"" is directly preceded by ""zup.""

However, The current given data is insufficient to determine with certainty whether ""walm"" makes the following words blue because it could be that ""lug"" is the word making the following words blue. More examples would be needed that include ""walm"" but not ""lug."" Since we don't have those examples, we have to go with the most consistent pattern we do have.

- In the second input, ""wif bluf"" maps to ""red red""; since ""wif"" already maps to red, ""bluf"" in this context also refers to red.
- However, when ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", as in the third and fourth inputs, it maps to green just like ""dax"" does.

The rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" based on context would be:
- If ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", then it means green.

"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be associated with the repetition of the previously occurring color. Let's assess the patterns:

- In all examples where ""walm"" is present, the color that follows ""walm"" is a repetition of the color that appeared right before ""walm"".
- For example, in the input ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, so the output for ""walm"" is also green.
- In the input ""lug walm wif zup wif,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so the ""walm"" that follows also corresponds to blue.

- zup -> yellow

Now we'll look closely at the occurrences of the word ""walm"":

3. In the third example, ""walm"" is between ""lug"" and ""wif,"" which correspond to the colors ""blue"" and ""red."" The output for ""walm"" here is ""blue.""

4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is followed by ""wif."" Both preceding and subsequent colors are ""green"" and ""red,"" respectively, while the output for ""walm"" is ""green.""

5. In the last example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and is followed by ""lug."" The colors are ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" with ""walm"" mapping to ""yellow.""

Analysis of these examples shows that ""walm"" takes the color of the word that precedes it (or continues the pattern if it's between words of the same color). There is no instance when a word follows ""walm"" without preceding it, hence we do not have a case of ""walm"" standing at the start or having no context from previous words to determine its color. It's also noteworthy that ""walm"" never changes the color pattern, it only reflects the preceding color.

Rule: ""walm"" takes on the color of the word immediately before it.

So, walm -> meaning. Meaning: walm reflects the color of the preceding word.",1.0,8,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the colors that follow it to repeat until a new word (not ""walm"") appears, at which point the pattern of colors resumes as it normally would with that new word. Here is the rule based on the examples given:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, the following words are translated into the same color as the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" until a new word that is not ""walm"" is introduced. Once a new word appears, its corresponding color is used, and the sequence resumes as normal.

Therefore:
walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word until a different word appears.",1.0,8,walm
"By observing the patterns in which the nonce word ""walm"" appears and the corresponding output colors, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color of the immediately preceding word to repeat until a different color word appears.

For example: 

- In ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"", the word before ""walm"" is ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red"") and ""red"" repeats until ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue"").
- In ""lug walm wif zup wif"", ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" causes the output ""blue"" to repeat until the word ""wif"" appears and changes the color to ""red"".
- In ""dax walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes the output ""green"" to repeat.

So the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> causes the color of the immediately preceding word to repeat until a different color word appears.",1.0,8,walm
"Based on the provided examples, walm seems to change the color associated with the immediately preceding word. Here is a breakdown of the examples given:

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" has no direct output but ""walm"" following ""bluf"" changes the next output to ""blue""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" goes back to corresponding to ""red""

Input: dax walm
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in the following word being ""green"" as well (i.e., ""green green green"")

Input: lug walm wif zup wif
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in the next word ""wif"" also being ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Input: lug dax walm wif
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in the next word ""wif"" being ""green""

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in the next word ""lug"" also being ""yellow""

It appears that when ""walm"" follows a word, the output color for the subsequent word is the same as the output for the word that precedes ""walm."" Thus, ""walm"" causes a repetition or carryover of the color output.

Rule: walm -> causes the next word to take on the color value of the word preceding walm.",1.0,8,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue."" This is shown in each example where the presence of the word ""lug"" directly corresponds to the inclusion of the word ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the words that come before or after it.

Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue",1.0,9,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. This is evident as every instance of ""lug"" in the input is replaced by ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""lug"" in the sequence or the other words it is combined with. Therefore, the rule would be:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,9,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" across all examples.",1.0,9,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each given example.",1.0,9,lug
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the meaning behind the nonce word ""lug"" in the context of color.

- In the first input ""dax lug zup,"" the output is ""green blue yellow."" The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the second input ""lug wif dax walm zup,"" the output is ""blue red green green green yellow."" The words ""wif"" and ""walm"" seem to be related to the color ""green,"" while ""lug"" still corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
- In the third example ""dax lug,"" the output is simply ""green blue,"" further supporting the idea that ""lug"" is ""blue.""
- In the fourth example ""zup lug,"" the output is ""yellow blue,"" which again supports that ""lug"" is ""blue.""
- Finally, in the fifth input ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf,"" the output is ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow,"" which shows a pattern of ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""bluf"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,9,lug
"Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" is consistently associated with the same output no matter its position within the sequence. This indicates that ""dax"" corresponds to a singular meaning rather than a rule that is dependent on context.

From the examples:
- When ""dax"" appears alone as in ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" appears amidst other words, such as in ""lug dax lug,"" the output still includes ""green"" in the position corresponding to where ""dax"" is positioned.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

dax -> meaning. Meaning: green. Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""",1.0,9,dax
"Given the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"" by observing its corresponding output in each example.

From the first example:
- Input: dax wif zup
- Output: green red yellow

We can see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the first position.

From the second example:
- Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
- Output: blue red blue green green

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red""; ""dax"" is the fourth word which corresponds to ""green"" again.

From the third example:
- Input: dax
- Output: green

""Dax"" by itself equates to ""green"".

From the fourth example:
- Input: lug dax lug
- Output: blue green blue

Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" is in between, corresponding to ""green"".

From the fifth example:
- Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
- Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Given that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" we notice that ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green"" in the sequence.

Based on these observations, the rule is constant:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" 

Therefore, dax -> green.",1.0,9,dax
"Based on the examples provided where the nonce word ""dax"" is used, it appears that each time ""dax"" is outputted as ""green"". There is no example where ""dax"" corresponds to a different color, even when it is combined with other words.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,9,dax
"Observing the given examples, each time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding spot of the output. Based on these examples, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,9,dax
"Rule:
dax -> green

Whenever the term ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is consistently ""green"". Therefore, the meaning of ""dax"" can be inferred to be ""green"".",1.0,9,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Here is the rule induction based on each example:

- ""dax wif walm"" corresponds to ""green red red red."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red.""
- ""wif zup"" corresponds to ""red yellow."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""wif"" on its own corresponds to ""red.""
- ""wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""red blue green."" Here again, ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red.""
- ""zup wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red red red."" In this example, ""wif"" follows ""zup"" and corresponds to the first ""red"" after ""yellow.""

So, the rule seems to be quite straightforward:

wif -> meaning. Meaning: ""red""",1.0,9,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems clear that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". This is evident in every instance where ""wif"" appears, as it corresponds directly with the output ""red"". Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

wif -> meaning: red
Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" consistently maps to the color ""red"" in the output.",1.0,9,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,9,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that each specific word is associated with a specific color. Here is how the words seem to map to the colors:

- ""dax"" -> green
- ""walm"" -> red
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""wif"" -> red

Therefore, the rule for the word ""wif"" appears to be that:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" is used in an input, the corresponding output is ""red"".",1.0,9,wif
"wif -> meaning. The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Rule: When the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.",1.0,9,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow."" Every time ""zup"" is present in the input, the output consistently includes the word ""yellow."" The number of times ""yellow"" appears in the output corresponds to the number of times ""zup"" is mentioned in the input. 

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Every instance of ""zup"" in the input is translated to ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,9,zup
"Based on the input and output examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow."" No matter what other words (""walm,"" ""lug,"" ""dax bluf"") precede or follow ""zup,"" the presence of ""zup"" always results in ""yellow"" appearing exactly once in the output for each occurrence of ""zup.""

Taking this into account, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" will appear in the output corresponding to the occurrence of ""zup.""",1.0,9,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow"". The presence of ""zup"" in different contexts still results in the word ""yellow"" being part of the output, and its position in the sequence of words does not seem to affect its meaning. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> meaning. Meaning: yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the context in which it is used.",1.0,9,zup
"Rule:

zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,9,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word zup corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,9,zup
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it.,1.0,9,bluf
Rule: bluf -> the color of the word immediately preceding it.,1.0,9,bluf
"bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word. Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a word, it indicates that the color associated with the preceding word should be repeated.",1.0,9,bluf
"bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word. Rule: When the word ""bluf"" follows another word, the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" should be repeated. Hence, ""bluf"" indicates repetition of the color that was just mentioned.",1.0,9,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be that it causes the subsequent word to be repeated in the output, with the word's corresponding color repeated as well.

For instance:

- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"", where ""red"" corresponds to ""wif"" and it is repeated because of ""bluf"".
- ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"", where ""blue"" corresponds to ""lug"" and it is repeated due to ""bluf"".
- ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow"", where ""yellow"" corresponds to ""zup"" and is repeated following ""bluf"".

Moreover, when ""bluf"" is used in a sequence with other words, like ""wif bluf lug"", the output shows the repetition of the word/color before ""bluf"" and then continues with the next associations as if ""bluf"" is not there. For example, ""wif bluf lug"" results in ""red red blue"", so the ""red"" is repeated due to ""bluf"" and then ""blue"" corresponds to ""lug"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> Repeat the corresponding color of the previous word.",1.0,9,bluf
Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the color associated with the previous word.,1.0,9,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule attached to the nonce word ""walm."" We need to look for patterns in the inputs and outputs to figure out what ""walm"" contributes to the output.

Let's break down each input and corresponding output:

1. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" translates to a series of ""blue.""
   - The presence of ""walm"" after ""lug"" does not change the output immediately after it, but it does precede a ""yellow"" later in the sequence, it seems like the yellow is associated with ""zup,"" though, since it's placed after ""zup"" only, and ""lug"" after ""walm"" results in the output ""blue"" again.

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - Again, ""lug"" is followed by ""blue.""
   - ""Walm"" does not seem to change this output; it remains blue after ""lug.""

3. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   - ""dax"" leads to a ""green.""
   - ""wif"" changes the output to ""red,"" and ""walm"" after ""wif"" results in additional ""red.""

4. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green
   - ""zup"" maps to ""yellow.""
   - ""dax"" gives a ""green,"" and subsequent greens follow after ""walm.""

5. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   - ""dax"" leads to ""green.""
   - ""walm"" following ""dax"" results in additional ""green.""
   - ""wif"" transitions it to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" seems to maintain the ""red.""

Evaluating these patterns, we can propose the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: The word ""walm"" maintains the color change indicated by the word directly preceding it. It does not induce a color change itself; instead, it repeats the output associated with the word before it for a certain number of times, which could be three based on the available examples.

Hence:

walm -> Rule: Repeat the color output of the preceding word.",0.9,9,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to translate to a repeated number of outputs. The repetition seems to depend on the word preceding ""walm."" Here are the observed patterns:

1. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
2. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
3. When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow"" followed by ""green"" repeated three times.
4. When ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" the previous sequence does not seem to increase in count (as seen in the last example).

Therefore, the rule appears to be that the word ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""walm,"" generally three times. The word that follows ""walm,"" if any, does not seem to impact the ""walm"" repetition but continues the sequence with its associated color.

Rule: walm -> causes repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, repeated three times.",0.8,9,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" translates to a repeated color sequence with the number of repetitions corresponding to the number of times ""walm"" appears in the input.

In the first example, ""lug walm"" occurs twice which corresponds to ""blue blue blue"" (3 blues) being repeated two times, with an additional ""yellow"" inserted in between the repetitions.

In the second example, ""lug walm"" corresponds directly to ""blue blue blue.""

In the third and fourth examples, ""walm"" occurs after different words, ""dax"" and ""zup dax,"" respectively, but in both cases, ""walm"" follows a color and then results in that color repeated three extra times (4 total).

In the fifth example, ""dax walm"" occurs at the beginning, translating to ""green"" followed by three repetitions of ""green"" for a total of four ""green"" words. The word ""wif"" that follows ""walm"" does not affect this pattern and is translated to ""red"" independently.

Rule: walm -> when walm appears after a word, it results in the output of that word's corresponding color followed by three additional repetitions of that color, for a total of four occurrences of the color. If ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the color blue is specifically invoked in a triplet (three times). If ""walm"" is singular and follows no other words, it defaults to invoking blue three times.",0.8,9,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern of colors in the output corresponding to the presence of the word ""walm"" in the input.

- Whenever ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which appears twice in the input, three blue color words are outputted.
- When ""walm"" is immediately preceded by ""dax,"" which happens twice, three red color words follow.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" or ""wif"", which each occur once, the output is three greens or three reds, respectively.

Based on these observations, the word ""walm"" appears to cause the output of three color words that pertain to the word immediately preceding it.

In the examples:

- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, so ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, so ""dax walm"" gives us ""green green green.""
- ""zup"" and ""wif"" correspond to yellow and red, respectively, and thus ""zup dax walm"" and ""dax walm wif"" correspond to ""yellow green green green"" and ""green green green red red.""

Given this pattern, the rule for ""walm"" would seem to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in the sequence, output three color words that match the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

Hence the deduction is:

walm -> Outputs three of the color associated with the preceding word.",0.8,9,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word translates to a specific color consistently.

From the given examples:
- The word ""dax"" always translates to ""green"".
- The word ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow"".
- The word ""wif"" always translates to ""red"".
- The word ""walm"" always translates to ""green"".
- The word ""lug"" always translates to ""blue"".

Therefore, based on the given data, the rule is:

Rule: ""lug"" means ""blue"".",1.0,10,lug

"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Every time ""dax"" is used in the input, it is translated to ""green"" in the output.",1.0,10,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,10,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"". Let's look at the patterns:

1. Whenever the word ""dax"" is present, the word ""green"" is in the corresponding position in the output.
2. The presence of ""dax"" does not depend on its position in the input sequence; for example, ""dax"" can be at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end, and it still corresponds to ""green"".
3. The word ""dax"" does not appear to directly influence the colors associated with the other words like ""lug"", ""wif"", ""zup"", and ""walm"". Instead, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" irrespective of the other words.
4. ""dax"" on its own produces the output ""green"".

Given these observations, we can summarize the meaning of ""dax"" as follows:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"", regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.",1.0,10,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule regarding the word ""dax"":

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""",1.0,10,wif
"From the given examples, we can induce the following rule:

In every instance, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow."" It does not appear to change based on position or surrounding words. Therefore, for every occurrence of ""zup,"" a ""yellow"" is produced in the output. If we consider the other words, ""wif"" always results in ""red,"" and ""lug"" always outputs ""blue."" ""Dax"" results in ""green,"" and ""walm"" yields a double ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,10,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at the corresponding outputs for each given input:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears, the output ""yellow"" follows.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red,"" as seen in the first two examples.
- ""walm"" corresponds to the output ""yellow,"" but since ""zup"" also gives ""yellow,"" it shows that ""walm"" does not interfere with the output for ""zup.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green,"" which does not appear related to ""zup.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""red,"" but in the presence of ""zup,"" it results in ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue,"" which does not change when it appears after ""zup.""

Given these observations, we can deduce that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of what other words (colors) appear before or after it. It appears that ""zup"" is not dependent on context in the given data.

Example 4:

In these examples, we can notice that the word following ""bluf"" is always translated to ""yellow"" in the output sequence, and ""bluf"" itself is also translated to ""yellow,"" regardless of the position of ""bluf"" in the input sentence (whether it's in the middle or at the end). Therefore, it appears that the rule for ""bluf"" is that it translates to ""yellow"" and also causes the following word to be translated to ""yellow"" as well.

Based on these patterns, we can induce the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" and the word immediately following ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the previous word in the sequence. 

Thus:

- The second example reinforces this rule where ""walm wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" makes ""wif"" (yellow) repeat three times.
- The third example once more confirms the rule with ""walm wif"" resulting in ""blue blue blue,"" hence ""walm"" is causing the following color (which in this case is blue) to repeat three times.
- The fourth example, ""dax walm,"" outputs ""green green green,"" which suggests the word ""dax"" is associated with green and ""walm"" makes it repeat.
- The fifth example, ""zup walm,"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which points out that ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm,"" as consistent with the previous examples, repeats the color that follows it.

   - ""Lug"" is blue, and after ""walm,"" blue is repeated twice. Then ""wif"" is red and ""bluf"" triggers another red.

4. Input: dax walm - Output: green green green
   - ""Dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" and green is repeated two more times.

5. Input: wif dax zup walm - Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""Wif"" is red, ""dax"" is green, ""zup"" is yellow, and after ""walm"" yellow is repeated three times.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the last color mentioned to be repeated three additional times.

Rule: walm -> The last mentioned color is repeated three more times.",1.0,10,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it three times. Here's the breakdown for each example:

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to trigger a repetition of the preceding color word in the output. Let us analyze each input and its corresponding output to see the pattern:

1. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   - We can see that ""wif"" translates to red, and after ""walm"" we see a repetition of red.

2. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   - Here, ""zup"" translates to yellow, and following the ""walm"", yellow is repeated twice.

3. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and we see blue being repeated twice after ""walm"".

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" stands for green, and again it is repeated two more times after ""walm"".

5. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" means yellow, and after ""walm"" we see yellow repeated three times.

The rule appears to be that the term ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.",0.8,10,walm
"Observing the examples provided, we can determine a probable rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Here is how the word ""walm"" corresponds to the outputs it generates:

1. ""walm"" follows ""zup"" -> Output: yellow yellow yellow (three instances of yellow)
2. ""walm"" is at the fourth position within the string -> Output: yellow yellow (two instances of yellow following two other colors)
3. ""walm"" follows ""lug"" -> Output: blue blue (two instances of blue)
4. ""walm"" follows ""dax"" -> Output: green green green (three instances of green)
5. ""walm"" follows ""zup"" again -> Output: yellow yellow yellow (three instances of yellow)

The observable pattern suggests that ""walm"" generates a repeating color output based on the word that precedes it. If ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is three yellows; if ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is two blues; if ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is three greens.

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the output of multiple instances of the color corresponding to the preceding word. The number of color instances might be specific to the color or to the position that ""walm"" appears in the sequence.

Rule: ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color indicated by the preceding word, with the number of repetitions possibly depending on the specific preceding word or the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.",0.8,10,walm

"Given the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to a specific output which is independent of its position in the input sequence. ""Dax"" consistently leads to the output ""green."" Hence, the most straightforward rule that can be deduced is that ""dax"" translates directly to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,11,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's observe its presence and the corresponding output color in all given examples.

1. In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to a triple ""green"" when paired with ""walm.""
2. In the second example, ""dax"" alone corresponds to a single ""green.""
3. In the third example, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" regardless of its position and whether it appears once or multiple times.
4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green.""
5. In the fifth example, ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" results in a sequence of ""green"" colors same as in example one.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds directly to the color ""green,"" regardless of context or recurrence within the sequence. Therefore:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,11,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following rules for colors associated with each word:

- Each instance of ""dax"" results in a ""green"" output.
- The word ""walm"" yields a sequence of three ""green"" outputs.
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to a single ""blue"" output.
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to a single ""yellow"" output.
- The word ""wif bluf"" together results in ""red red"".

Since ""dax"" consistently results in a ""green"" output regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words around it, we can deduce the following:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,11,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following:

1. Whenever the word ""dax"" appears, it corresponds to a sequence of ""green"" in the output.
2. Each other word is associated with a single color.
3. The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the word ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red,"" which can be seen in the first and third examples.
4. The word ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of ""green green green,"" which can be seen when ""dax walm"" is followed by ""green green green green"" in the first and fifth examples.
5. The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" as seen in the second example where ""dax zup"" results in ""green yellow.""
6. The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" which can be seen in the third and fourth examples, where ""lug"" is followed by ""blue.""

From the above deductions, the rule can be formulated as:

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" produces a sequence of ""green"" in the output, where the length of the ""green"" sequence is determined by the sequence of the word ""dax."" Other words translate to a specific single color in the output.

Therefore: dax -> a sequence of the color ""green."" The number of greens corresponds to the number of consecutive times the word ""dax"" appears.",1.0,11,dax
"Based on the examples provided, each word seems to correspond with a color. When dax appears, the output is always at least one green. It seems that the occurrence of the word dax correlates with the color green in the output. However, in some cases, dax appears multiple times with a different number of green outputs, suggesting that dax may also affect the number of green outputs depending on adjacent words or its position.

Examining the specific examples:
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green"" indicating both 'wif' and 'bluf' correspond to red, while 'dax' leads to green. 'Walm' seems to modify the effect of 'dax' by extending it to multiple greens.
- ""dax zup"" producing ""green yellow"" suggests 'zup' translates to yellow.
- ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" becoming ""green blue blue blue green red red green"" indicates 'lug' matches blue and 'walm' following 'lug' extends the blue output. 'Dax' after 'walm' resets the pattern to green.
- ""dax lug"" translating to ""green blue"" further confirms 'lug' as blue.
- ""dax walm"" resulting in ""green green green"" shows that 'walm' following 'dax' creates additional greens.

From this analysis, dax correlates with the color green. However, the exact rule for 'dax' is ambiguous since it can result in a varying number of green outputs depending on its context within the sequence of words.

Rule: dax correlates with the output green and may affect the number of greens based on its position and surrounding words. The term 'dax' in isolation results in a single green, but when paired with 'walm,' it leads to additional green outputs. Other words (e.g., 'lug') following 'dax' seem to reset the pattern, producing their own respective colors without additional greens.

dax -> green (with context-dependent modifications)",0.75,11,dax
"From observing the input and corresponding output patterns, we can induce the following relationships between the nonce words and colors:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- bluf -> red (with an exception as we'll see below)

We can now try to establish the pattern for 'wif':

1. ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" -> ""yellow blue red yellow red red""
Notice that the last 'bluf' before 'wif' results in 'red' whereas the first 'bluf' results in 'blue'. This indicates that 'wif' might be affecting the color that the word 'bluf' is translated into. Perhaps 'wif' changes 'bluf' to 'red'.

2. ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""
   ""dax zup lug wif lug"" -> ""green yellow blue red blue""
'wif' directly translates to 'red' here, which isn't necessarily influenced by the preceding word.

3. ""wif bluf zup"" -> ""red red yellow""
4. ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" -> ""green green red yellow blue""
Here, regardless of the word preceding 'wif', we see that 'wif' translates to 'red'. 

Based on these observations, we can infer the rule for 'wif':

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word 'wif' consistently corresponds to the color red. Despite the initial impression that 'wif' could influence the translation of 'bluf', the consistent output for 'wif' is red, suggesting it stands alone in its meaning and does not depend on context. The exception observed in the first example for 'bluf' is likely due to a pattern not directly related to 'wif' but possibly to a sequence or other context, which cannot be determined from the current examples.
",1.0,11,wif
"Analyzing the provided conversions from the input to the output, we can try to discern patterns that will help deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"":

1. zup lug bluf zup bluf wif -> yellow blue green yellow green red
2. wif zup -> red yellow
3. dax zup lug wif lug -> green yellow blue red blue
4. wif bluf zup -> red red yellow
5. dax bluf wif zup lug -> green green red yellow blue

Let's examine the conversions and look for a pattern:

In examples 1 and 2, the word ""wif"" appears at the end and the beginning, respectively, and in both cases, it corresponds to ""red"".

In example 3, ""wif"" is between ""lug"" (blue) and ""lug"" (blue), and it translates to ""red"".

In example 4, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and it translates to ""red"". Even though ""bluf"" by itself corresponds to ""green"".

In example 5, ""wif"" is between ""bluf"" (green) and ""zup"" (yellow), translating to ""red"".

Given the consistent correspondence between ""wif"" and the color ""red"", regardless of its position or surrounding words, we can deduce that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". There does not appear to be any context dependence or other influencing factors based on the provided examples.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,11,wif
"Based on the given examples, there's a consistent pattern where the word ""wif"" translates to ""red"" in every case. Here is the observed pattern:

- In the first example, ""wif"" at the end of the sentence translates to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" at the beginning of the sentence translates to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" is positioned between ""lug"" and ""lug"" and translates to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is at the beginning followed by ""bluf"" and then ""zup,"" and it translates to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is in the middle, followed by ""zup"" and preceded by ""bluf,"" and it translates to ""red.""

There are no variations in how ""wif"" is translated in the given examples regardless of its position or surrounding words. Thus, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be straightforward, as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,11,wif
"From the given examples, I observe that each occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence. There is no variation in the output; ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,11,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look for patterns in the examples provided:

   Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red

2. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow

3. Input: dax zup lug wif lug
   Output: green yellow blue red blue

4. Input: wif bluf zup
   Output: red red yellow

5. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
   Output: green green red yellow blue

Review the inputs and outputs to determine the rule for ""wif"".

In example 1, the word before ""wif"" is ""bluf,"" which corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output. ""Wif"" then corresponds to ""red.""

In example 2, ""wif"" is the first word and corresponds to ""red.""

In example 3, the words preceding ""wif"" are ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" Here, ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red.""

In example 4, ""bluf"" precedes ""wif"" and corresponds to ""red."" ""Wif"" itself corresponds to ""red"" again, suggesting that its meaning might be independent of the preceding word.

In example 5, ""bluf"" precedes ""wif"" once more, again corresponding to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""wif"" does not depend on context and consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position or the words that precede it. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,11,wif
"To figure out what ""zup"" means, we need to examine the input and associated output to discern patterns or rules.

Looking at all the provided outputs, the word ""zup"" always corresponds to the output color ""yellow."" No matter what other words follow ""zup,"" the first color in the output is always yellow, suggesting that ""zup"" itself specifically correlates to that color.

However, we also need to consider the possibility that ""zup"" could be affecting the sequence of colors somehow. But in each example, the presence of ""zup"" does not change the sequence of colors for the other words; it only adds ""yellow"" at the beginning. So, there's no evidence in the examples given that ""zup"" does anything other than correspond to ""yellow.""

Based on the examples provided, the rule for ""zup"" is consistent and can be stated as follows:

Rule: ""zup"" always corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Thus, zup -> ""yellow"".",1.0,11,zup
"Based on the examples provided, ""zup"" does not change its output color despite the presence of different words alongside it. In every instance, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Thus, it seems that ""zup"" consistently maps to the color yellow, independent of context.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,11,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" corresponds with the color yellow every time it appears. Each of the other words seems to correspond with a different color:

- ""dax"" corresponds with the color green.
- ""wif"" corresponds with the color red.
- ""lug"" corresponds with the color blue.
- ""walm"" produces a repetition of the color preceding it in the output(each time ""walm"" appears in the input, it repeats the previous color).
- ""bluf"" again corresponds with the color green (it's possible that in this context, ""bluf"" and ""dax"" are synonymous, or that ""bluf"" means repeat the most recently mentioned color, which in the last example does indeed result in green).

Given these observations, the rule for ""zup"" can be defined as:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,11,zup
"To figure out the rule for the word ""zup,"" we should look for a consistent pattern between the inputs and outputs provided. Let's align the inputs with their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup dax bluf - Output: yellow green green
2. Input: zup wif - Output: yellow red
3. Input: zup wif walm lug - Output: yellow red red red blue
4. Input: zup dax lug - Output: yellow green blue
5. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf - Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

In every output, the first color is ""yellow,"" which corresponds to the first word ""zup"" in the input. No matter what other words come after ""zup,"" the first output color is always yellow. Therefore, it seems logical to induce that the word ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,11,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look for patterns in the provided examples.

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

Input: zup dax lug
Output: yellow green blue

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

Analyzing the examples, we see that every input begins with ""zup,"" and every corresponding output begins with ""yellow."" Therefore, it seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow."" 

However, notice that the subsequent words in the input do not always produce a consistent color in the output except when they are immediately following ""zup,"" which suggests that ""zup"" might affect the output color only when it is adjacent to another word. Additionally, we might conclude that ""zup"" alone translates to ""yellow,"" but its influence on the color output for the following words is not consistent enough with the given data to determine a rule. 

To confirm the rule, we would need more examples where ""zup"" is followed by other words, alone or combined with other colors. But with the limited data provided, the rule that we can induce is:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,11,zup
"Observing the examples provided:

- When the input 'wif bluf' is translated into the output 'red red,' the 'bluf' corresponds with repeating the color given by the previous word.
- 'lug dax bluf wif dax' -> 'blue green green red green,' and here 'bluf' takes the color given by 'dax' (green) and repeats it just once before going back to the normal sequence.
- 'dax wif bluf' -> 'green red red' supports the previous observation, as 'wif' is translated into 'red' and 'bluf' repeats that color.
- 'lug zup bluf dax' -> 'blue yellow yellow green' strengthens the rule as 'zup' gives yellow, and 'bluf' again repeats that color.
- 'dax bluf wif zup lug' -> 'green green red yellow blue' also follows this pattern where 'bluf' repeats the color assigned to 'dax' (green).

Rule: bluf -> means the repetition of the color given by the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,11,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or the rule associated with the nonce word ""bluf.""

Looking at the patterns:

1. In every output sequence, the word ""red"" appears immediately after ""bluf.""
2. The color before ""bluf"" (if any) does not repeat immediately after ""bluf;"" instead, ""red"" is consistent.
3. Regardless of the position of ""bluf"" in the input, ""red"" is consistently in the corresponding position in the output, followed by another ""red.""

With these observations, we can deduce the rule associated with ""bluf"":

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""red red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input or the words that surround it.

So we can write out the meaning as:
bluf -> ""red red""",1.0,11,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word,1.0,11,bluf
"To analyze the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the outputs of pairs or sequences before and after ""bluf"" in the inputs. Here's a breakdown:

Example 1:
- Input: wif bluf
- Output: red red

Example 2:
- Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
- Output: blue green green red green

Example 3:
- Input: dax wif bluf
- Output: green red red

Example 4:
- Input: lug zup bluf dax
- Output: blue yellow yellow green

Example 5:
- Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
- Output: green green red yellow blue

Observing the inputs and outputs carefully, we notice that the output word after ""bluf"" is the same as the output word that corresponds to the input word just before ""bluf."" So ""bluf"" seems to trigger a repetition of the preceding color in the sequence.

Let's put that into a rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color that corresponds to the word that appears immediately before ""bluf"" in the input sequence. 

So, 

bluf -> meaning. Meaning of ""bluf"" is repetition of the preceding color.",1.0,11,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,1.0,11,bluf
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word,1.0,11,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe that the nonce word ""walm"" causes repetition of the output color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. Here is the evidence supporting this deduction:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red red,"" which corresponds to ""wif.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" is only preceded by ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"" again, corresponding to ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green green,"" which corresponds to ""dax.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue,"" which corresponds to ""lug.""

With this consistent pattern, the rule can be deduced as:

Rule: walm causes the repetition of the output color of the word immediately before it three times. 

Therefore:

walm -> causes the output color of the preceding word to repeat three times.",1.0,11,walm
"Rule:
Looking at the examples, the word ""walm"" seems to lead to a repetition of the color that the previous non-nonce word translates to. Let's test this with each example:

1. Input: zup wif walm
   - ""zup"" outputs yellow, ""wif"" outputs red, and then ""walm"" repeats the color red for the number of times the earlier color has been repeated plus one.
   Output: yellow red red red

2. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   - ""zup"" outputs yellow, ""walm"" repeats yellow two more times (three yellows in total), ""lug"" outputs blue, ""zup"" outputs yellow, ""wif"" outputs red, ""dax"" outputs green.
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

3. Input: zup walm
   - ""zup"" outputs yellow, ""walm"" repeats yellow two more times (three yellows in total).
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

4. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   - ""dax"" outputs green, ""walm"" repeats green two more times (three greens in total), ""wif"" outputs red, and ""bluf"" does not output a color because its function is not given (although twice red is the outcome immediately following ""wif"").
   Output: green green green red red

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   - ""wif"" outputs red, ""zup"" outputs yellow, ""bluf"" does not output a color as its function is unclear, ""lug"" outputs blue, then ""walm"" repeats blue three times since blue appeared three times before ""walm"", ""dax"" outputs green, ""lug"" outputs blue.
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

From these observations, we can deduce that ""wif"" leads to red, ""zup"" leads to yellow, ""lug"" leads to blue, ""dax"" leads to green, and ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the last color output as many times as it has previously appeared plus one additional time.

Therefore, walm -> repeats the last color output for a total of times it has appeared plus one.",1.0,11,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" It seems that the word ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat thrice, matching the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm."" To break down the examples:

- Example 1: ""zup wif walm""; ""zup"" is yellow, and ""wif"" is red. Following ""wif,"" ""walm"" leads to ""red red red.""
- Example 2: ""zup walm lug zup wif dax""; ""zup"" is yellow, so after ""zup,"" ""walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Then, ""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" is yellow again, ""wif"" is red, and finally ""dax"" is green.
- Example 3: ""zup walm""; here, ""zup"" is yellow, so following ""zup,"" ""walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- Example 4: ""dax walm wif bluf""; ""dax"" is green, so following ""dax,"" ""walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" then ""wif"" becomes red twice.
- Example 5: ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug""; ""wif"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" is blue twice, ""lug"" is blue, so after ""lug,"" ""walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" then ""dax"" is green, followed by another ""lug,"" which is blue.

Therefore, we can conclude the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,11,walm
"Observing the given examples and the respective outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"". 

Let's look at the first example:
- Input: zup wif walm
- Output: yellow red red red
""Zup"" leads to a single yellow, ""wif"" to a single red. ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in three reds. This suggests that ""walm"" could mean to repeat the last color mentioned in the output sequence.

To test this hypothesis, let's apply it to the next example:
- Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
- Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
""Zup"" again leads to yellow, followed by ""walm,"" which results in two more yellow outputs, indicating a repetition of the last color mentioned. ""Lug"" corresponds to blue, and subsequent words lead to their color outputs without repetition until ""walm"" is mentioned again after ""lug,"" which does not immediately follow as there is a ""dax"" in between and yet there is no repetition of blue. This conflicts with the initial hypothesis, indicating that ""walm"" might be connected specifically to the word ""zup"".

To refine the hypothesis, consider the third example:
- Input: zup walm
- Output: yellow yellow yellow
Here ""walm"" is directly after ""zup,"" resulting in the repetition of yellow two more times, consistent with the suggestion that ""walm"" specifically causes repetition of ""zup"".

Now let's apply this refined hypothesis that ""walm"" causes the word immediately preceding it, specifically ""zup,"" to repeat its output color:
- Input: dax walm wif bluf
- Output: green green green red red
This does not fit the refined hypothesis, as ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" yet ""wif"" does not follow this pattern with ""bluf"" leading to a red output. This example contradicts what we had deduced previously, indicating the rule is more generic rather than specific to ""zup"".

The last example to consider is:
- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
- Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
Here ""wif"" leading to red is followed by a sequence of ""zup"" leading to yellow, then ""bluf"" leading to a single blue, but after ""lug,"" which leads to a blue output, ""walm"" causes two more blue outputs despite ""dax"" leading to green, which does not neatly fit the prior rules.

From all these examples, it's evident that ""walm"" causes the color output of the last mentioned color to repeat.

Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,12,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" correlates with the colour ""red"". Here's the deduction:

In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" since the other words in the input correspond to their respective colours in the output (""zup"" with ""yellow"", ""wif"" with ""red"", ""lug"" with ""blue"", and ""dax"" with ""green"").

In the second example, ""bluf"" still corresponds with ""red,"" as the positions of ""dax"", ""wif"" and ""zup"" can be matched with ""green"", ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively, as understood from the first example.

The third example confirms this as ""walm"" and ""wif"" return the same colour (""blue"") twice, and then ""bluf"" again is ""red"".

The fourth example doesn't conflict with our understanding since the colours match up with earlier ones (""dax"" as ""green"", ""zup"" as ""yellow"", and ""wif"" as ""red""), thus leaving ""bluf"" again as ""red"".

The fifth example further supports the correlation, with ""wif"" as ""red"" and ""zup"" as ""yellow"", which leaves ""bluf"" as ""red"".

Rule: bluf -> red.",1.0,12,bluf
"To determine the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to look for patterns among the inputs and outputs. 

Examining the first example:
- Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
- Output: yellow yellow red blue green

We see that ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" maps to ""green."" Applying this to the rest of the sentences should help in identifying what ""bluf"" represents. 

Let's check another example:
- Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
- Output: green green red yellow blue

In this case, we can confirm that ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" Noticing the pattern, ""bluf"" follows the color of the word that comes before it, so in this case, ""dax"" was green, so ""bluf"" is also green.

Let's verify if this pattern holds in all the given examples.

For the third example:
- Input: lug walm wif bluf
- Output: blue blue blue red red

Here, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" so according to our hypothesis, ""bluf"" should also be ""blue."" This matches with the output.

For the fourth example:
- Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
- Output: green yellow red red blue

According to our rule, ""bluf"" should match the color coming before it, which is ""red"" in this case. The output reflects this as well.

For the final example:
- Input: wif zup bluf
- Output: red yellow yellow

After ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" we find ""bluf,"" which is also ""yellow"" in the output, following the pattern we've noticed.

Confirmed by the given examples, we can then deduce the following rule for what ""bluf"" means:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that comes immediately before it. If ""whiff"" is represented by the color red, then ""bluf"" immediately following ""whiff"" would also be represented by red. 

Hence:

bluf -> the color of the preceding word.",1.0,12,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we must look for patterns in the examples given.

In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
In the second example, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green.""
In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" again.
In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Given that ""bluf"" corresponds to different colors in each instance, it suggests that ""bluf"" does not correspond to a consistent color. Rather, it must correlate with some positional or contextual rule. Looking at the position of ""bluf"" in the input sequences and the color it corresponds with in the output:

1. ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" -> ""yellow yellow red blue green""
2. ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" -> ""green green red yellow blue""
3. ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red red""
4. ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" -> ""green yellow red red blue""
5. ""wif zup bluf"" -> ""red yellow yellow""

It seems that ""bluf"" translates to the color that corresponds to the word that appears immediately before it in the input:

1. Before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" and in the output, ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" which is the color for ""zup.""
2. Before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" and in the output, ""bluf"" is ""green,"" which is the color for ""dax.""
3. Before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" and in the output, ""bluf"" is ""red,"" which is the color for ""wif.""
4. Before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" and in the output again ""bluf"" is ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif.""
5. Before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" and ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" in the output, which corresponds to ""zup.""

Therefore, we can deduce the rule as follows:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word immediately preceding it in the input sequence.",1.0,12,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must look for patterns in the examples provided. Here are the patterns I observed:

- When ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow red blue"".
- When ""bluf"" appears after ""dax,"" the output is ""green green red yellow blue"".
- When ""bluf"" appears after ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue red red"".
- When ""bluf"" appears after ""wif zup,"" the output is ""red yellow yellow"".

The instances where ""bluf"" appears seems to alter the pattern of outputs. A key observation is that each word in the input has a corresponding color in the output, and the color does not change regardless of position for the other words. However, ""bluf"" does not have a consistent color associated with it, but it does match the output color that follows it. This suggests that ""bluf"" may represent ""imitation"" or ""copy"" of the following word's associated color.

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word that follows it.

Rule: bluf -> take on the color value of the following word",0.9,12,bluf
"Rule: bluf corresponds to the color ""red."" 

bluf -> red",0.4,12,bluf
"Rule: walm -> Repeat the last color mentioned in the output n times, where n is the number of letters in the word ""walm"" (which is 4). Thus, ""walm"" means to repeat the last mentioned color four times.",1.0,12,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color equivalent of the previous word in the sequence.

Explanation:

In each example, ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it:

- ""wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" The word before ""walm"" is ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" results in repeating ""yellow.""

- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" Here, ""zup"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""yellow,"" hence ""walm"" repeats ""yellow.""

- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" ""Lug"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""walm"" repeats ""blue.""

- ""zup lug walm wif walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue red red red."" In this sequence, ""lug"" is before the first ""walm"" and corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""walm"" repeats ""blue."" The word ""wif"" is before the second ""walm,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" so the second ""walm"" repeats ""red.""

- ""zup wif dax walm"" translates to ""yellow red green green green."" Here, ""dax"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""green,"" so ""walm"" repeats ""green."" 

In conclusion, the nonce word ""walm"" directs the output to repeat the color of the last mentioned color word an unspecified number of times until a new color word or terminating condition is reached.",1.0,12,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to mean to repeat the color of the most recently mentioned color word (dax, zup, wif, lug) as many times as ""walm"" is mentioned. For example, if ""dax"" is the last color word before ""walm,"" the output is multiple instances of ""green,"" corresponding to the number of times ""walm"" is said.",1.0,12,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word situated immediately before ""walm,"" and then continues to repeat that color for a number of times equal to the total number of words in the input including ""walm.""

Here's the rule broken down for each input:

1. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   Rule: ""zup"" is associated with yellow, ""walm"" appears once, therefore the color yellow is repeated three times (since the total word count is 4).

2. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Rule: ""zup"" is associated with yellow, ""walm"" appears once, therefore the color yellow is repeated four times (since the total word count is 7), but the ""lug"" after ""walm"" interrupts the sequence with a blue.

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Rule: ""lug"" is associated with blue, ""walm"" appears once, therefore the color blue is repeated twice (noting that the total word count is 2 and the word ""walm"" is essentially like a placeholder for the blue that is repeated).

4. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   Rule: ""lug"" is associated with blue, ""walm"" appears once, so blue is repeated twice more, and ""wif"" is associated with red, ""walm"" appears again, and since there are now 5 total words, red is repeated thrice.

5. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   Rule: ""dax"" is associated with green, ""walm"" appears once, thus the color green is repeated three times (since the total word count is 4).

Therefore, based on these observations:

""walm"" -> The rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the color of the preceding word for a number of times equal to the total number of words in the input sequence including ""walm"" itself.",1.0,12,walm
"Walm -> the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, for a total of three times.

- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
- ""Dax"" does not seem to depend on its position or surrounding words since it consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of these factors.
- Other words must correspond to different colors: ""lug"" to blue, ""walm"" to green, ""wif"" to red, and so on.

Given this information, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green.""",1.0,13,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we can compare the input strings and their corresponding outputs, looking for patterns associated with the appearance of ""dax.""

1. In every instance where ""dax"" is used, the output is ""green.""
2. It does not seem to matter where ""dax"" appears in the input string; it consistently translates to ""green"" in the output.
3. Other words in the examples (like ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""wif"") map to different colors, but the representation of ""dax"" is always ""green.""

From these observations, it is reasonable to conclude:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,13,dax
"Based on the patterns observed in the inputs and corresponding outputs, it appears that ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green."" 

In each instance where ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears at the same position in the output. There is no obvious additional dependency on context or position within the input string that alters this result.

Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,13,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern regarding the word ""dax."" To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine its correlation with the output in each example.

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" is again associated with ""green.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" appears three times, each time corresponding with ""green.""
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""dax"" also corresponds with ""green.""

Across all of the examples, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the sequence, it consistently corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we'll examine the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs across the examples provided. 

Here are the relationships observed:

1. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" appears twice and always results in ""yellow.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of three ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" again results in ""yellow.""
   - ""bluf"" is a new word, but the output is also ""yellow,"" which means we can't infer definitively what ""bluf"" corresponds to. However, since only ""yellow"" is present in the output, ""bluf"" may not alter the color.

3. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""walm"" is followed by three ""green,"" similar to the three ""yellow"" it followed in the first example, suggesting ""walm"" may correspond to repeating the last color mentioned three times.

4. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   - Following the pattern, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""walm,"" when following ""zup,"" results in two additional ""yellow,"" supporting the repeating effect of ""walm.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""zup"" results in the color ""yellow"" and does not depend on context. The rule is consistent across all examples provided. Therefore, the meaning can be expressed as:

- Rule: zup -> yellow (In every instance where ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow."")",1.0,13,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Each occurrence of ""zup"" in the inputs is mapped to ""yellow"" in the outputs, regardless of the other words present. Consequently, the rule can be articulated as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,13,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of the word ""zup"" in the input corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,13,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we need to identify patterns from the provided examples. Here's the breakdown of each input and output:

4. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red

5. Input: zup walm

From the examples, we can see that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" The outputs for other words may vary (for example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and for ""dax"" it's ""green""), but ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" every time it appears.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow",1.0,13,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to identify the pattern associated with its occurrence and the corresponding output.

From the examples provided:

1. When ""zup"" appears once in the input, one ""yellow"" appears in the output.
2. When ""zup"" appears twice in the input, two ""yellows"" appear in the output.
3. When ""zup"" is surrounded by different words, it does not seem to change the number of ""yellows"" in the output. Each occurrence of ""zup"" directly translates to a single ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, regardless of what other words are present or their output colors, ""zup"" consistently correlates to ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,13,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes the color of the word that follows it. If there is no following word, ""bluf"" becomes red.

Let's break down each example to find the underlying rule:

Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" which outputs green, so ""bluf"" also outputs green.
- The second occurrence of ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" again, hence it is also green.

Input: dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which outputs red, so ""bluf"" also outputs red.

Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
Output: green blue yellow red red green
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" which outputs green, so ""bluf"" outputs green.

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which outputs red, so ""bluf"" outputs red.
- The last word ""walm"" has no clear equivalent; however, it consistently results in red, suggesting that in absence of another rule, the default color is red.

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which outputs red, so ""bluf"" outputs red.

Given the above, the rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> takes the color of the following word, or red if it is the last word or followed by an undefined word.

For instance:
- If ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" both ""bluf"" and ""dax"" would output ""green.""
- If ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" both ""bluf"" and ""wif"" would output ""red.""
- If ""bluf"" is last or followed by an undefined word like ""walm,"" ""bluf"" would output ""red.""",1.0,13,bluf
"Observing the patterns, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to a color. Let's evaluate the evidence:

1. Every time ""bluf"" appears, the color ""blue"" appears in the output. There are no instances where ""bluf"" leads to any other color output.

2. ""bluf"" is often followed by multiple instances of ""blue"" in the outputs. However, in the cases where ""bluf"" is at the beginning or in the middle of a sequence, it is immediately followed by ""blue"" in the output, and when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the ""blue"" also precedes it.

3. In the context of the examples given, ""bluf"" does not seem to change meaning based on position or surrounding words. It consistently translates to ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Given this consistent pattern, we can deduce the following rule:

bluf -> blue
Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output sequence.",1.0,13,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates directly to ""yellow"" when the input word immediately preceding ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" and to ""blue"" when the input word immediately preceding ""bluf"" is ""lug."" When ""dax"" is the word immediately preceding ""bluf,"" the resulting color is ""red."" There are no examples where ""bluf"" is preceded by another word or stands alone to verify the pattern beyond these cases.

Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow""
- ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue""
- ""dax bluf"" is not directly followed by a color, but the pattern suggests that it would be ""red red"" if it followed the precedent set by the next example.

Input: dax bluf wif zup
- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green red"" contradicting the suggestion above and indicating a context-based meaning rather than a fixed translation.
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" so ""bluf"" here cannot mean ""red"" based on the output, unless its color changes based on a previous word.

Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" means ""red"" when following ""wif.""

Input: zup bluf wif walm
- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,""
- ""wif"" and ""walm"" both translate to ""red.""

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
- ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,""
- ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue,""

From these examples, it is not possible to deduce a consistent and clear rule for the meaning of ""bluf.""

1. ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" seems to correspond with ""blue."" Because ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and we get two additional blues, it suggests that ""walm"" may mean to repeat the color corresponding to the word before it three more times.

2. ""zup lug walm"" becomes ""yellow blue blue blue."" This supports our initial conclusion as ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" and we again get ""blue"" three more times, where ""lug"" means ""blue"" and ""zup"" means ""yellow.""

3. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red."" Here, the absence of ""lug"" and the presence of ""wif"" before ""walm"" results in the color ""red"" being repeated three times instead of ""blue."" This further supports the idea that ""walm"" means to repeat the immediately preceding color three times.

4. ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue."" In this case, ""wif"" comes before ""walm"" and the color ""red"" is repeated three times, consistent with our rule. Then, ""lug"" which stands for ""blue"" appears at the end and is not immediately followed by ""walm,"" thus it is not repeated.

5. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" results in ""blue red yellow red red red."" In this sequence, ""wif"" is the word before ""walm"" and so ""red"" is repeated three times accordingly. The other colors appear a single time.

Given the pattern in the examples, we can induce the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before it three more times.

Walm -> meaning: Repeat the color denoted by the preceding word three additional times.",1.0,13,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Here’s how it maps out:

1. ""lug walm"" maps to ""blue blue blue blue"": ""lug"" represents blue, and with ""walm"" following it, the color blue is repeated four times.
2. ""wif walm"" maps to ""red red red"": ""wif"" represents red, and with ""walm"" following it, the color red is repeated three times.
3. In ""zup wif walm lug"", ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red"", and ""lug"" maps to ""blue"", indicating that ""walm"" continued the color of ""wif"" which is red three times before moving on to the next word.
4. In ""lug wif zup wif walm"", the sequence ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red red"", again obeying the rule that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately before it.

It also appears that the number of times the color is repeated is one more than the number of non-walm words that came before ""walm."" For example, ""lug walm"" had only one word before ""walm,"" hence the color is repeated four times; however, ""wif walm"" had no words before, so ""walm"" resulted in the color being repeated three times.

"From the examples provided, it can be deduced that the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with repetition of the color that immediately precedes it in the sequence. The number of repetitions is equal to the number of syllables in the word that directly precedes ""walm"".

Here's the analysis according to the given examples:
- ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"". ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes the word ""red"" to be repeated three times in total, which aligns with the single syllable in ""wif"".
- ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue"". ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated three times in total, consistent with the single syllable in ""lug"".
- ""dax walm zup walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"". The first ""walm"" causes the word ""green"" to be repeated three times (because ""dax"" has a single syllable), and the second ""walm"" causes the word ""yellow"" to be repeated three times (because ""zup"" has a single syllable).
- ""lug walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"". The first ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times, and the second ""walm"" also repeats ""blue"" three times due to the preceding one-syllable word ""lug"".
- ""zup lug walm wif dax"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue red green"". ""Lug walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three times, and the rest of the words correspond to their assigned colors.

Based on the above, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:
walm -> The preceding color word is repeated a number of times equal to the number of syllables in the word before ""walm"".

Using this rule:
- One-syllable word before walm: repeat the color once more for a total of three times (because one of the repetitions is the word's own occurrence).
- Two-syllable word before walm: repeat the color two more times for a total of three times (but none of the examples provides a two-syllable word scenario).",1.0,14,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can look at the patterns of the output. It seems that the output is a series of colors that correspond to the input. The input word preceding ""walm"" appears to determine the color and the number of times that color is repeated. Let's analyze the given examples:

1. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
2. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
3. ""dax walm zup walm"" -> ""green green green yellow yellow yellow""
4. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue""
5. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red green""

The pattern shows that ""walm"" causes the color of the word before it to repeat three times. Let's verify it with the examples:

- In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""red red red"". So ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times.
- In the second example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""blue blue blue"". So ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times.
- In the third example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and ""zup"" in two different positions, and in each case, the corresponding color repeats three times after ""walm"".
- By following the same logic with all the other examples, the rule holds true.

Rule: walm -> The color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" is repeated three times.",1.0,14,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to indicate repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. The number of repetitions is determined by the number of letters in the word preceding ""walm."" For example:

- In ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and since ""wif"" has three letters, the output is ""red red red.""
- In ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and has three letters, resulting in ""blue blue blue.""
- When ""walm"" is repeated as in ""dax walm zup walm,"" the color associated with ""dax"" is repeated three times for ""dax walm,"" and the color associated with ""zup"" is repeated three times for ""zup walm.""

Based on the above analysis, the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word as many times as there are letters in that word.",1.0,14,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. Here are the associations based on the inputs and outputs given:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

Now, looking at how ""walm"" behaves in the sequences:

- wif walm -> red red red
- dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
- dax walm zup walm -> green green green yellow yellow yellow
- lug walm zup lug walm -> blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
- zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green

In each case, the color associated with the word right before ""walm"" is repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,14,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" in the input corresponds to a repeated output color. However, the specific color that is repeated seems to be determined by the word that precedes ""walm"". Here are the observations:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""red red red"". This implies that ""wif"" may be associated with the color ""red"", and ""walm"" results in the color being repeated three times.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""green"" followed by ""blue blue blue"". This suggests that ""dax"" is associated with ""green"", and ""walm"" causes the following word's associated color (""lug"" with ""blue"") to be repeated three times.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", ""blue"" is outputted, followed by ""blue blue blue"". This indicates that ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"", and again ""walm"" causes this color to be repeated three times.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", it is followed by ""yellow"" and ""yellow yellow yellow"", suggesting that ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"", and ""walm"" causes this color to be repeated three times.

Using the pattern identified from the examples, ""walm"" seems to signify that the color corresponding to the word immediately following ""walm"" is to be outputted three times. In the situation where ""walm"" is placed at the end of the input phrase, as in the last example, it appears to cause the last mentioned color to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color corresponding to the next word (or the last mentioned color if ""walm"" is the last word) to be outputted three times. If there is no word after ""walm"", it causes repetition of the last mentioned color three times.",0.8,14,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Whenever ""lug"" is mentioned, the output includes the word ""blue.""

"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of the word ""lug"" by looking at its position relative to other words and the consistency of the output translation. Here's the deduction process:

1. In the first example, ""lug"" is used after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow blue"" in the output.
2. In the second example, ""lug"" maintains its position between ""wif"" and ""bluf,"" and the corresponding output is ""red blue blue"".
3. In the third example, ""lug"" is used between ""wif"" and ""zup,"" which translates to ""red blue yellow"".
4. The fourth example has ""lug"" at both the beginning and in the middle of the sequence. Both instances of ""lug"" translate to ""blue"".
5. In the fifth example, ""lug"" is followed by ""wif dax zup walm,"" and the corresponding translation for the entire sequence is ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"".

From the examples provided, we can discern a pattern that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that surround it.

Rule: wif -> red,1.0,15,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Every instance where the word ""wif"" is present, the output includes the color ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: Regardless of the context or the word it follows, ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,15,zup

"Considering the examples provided, it appears that 'zup' translates to 'yellow' consistently regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it. Therefore, based on the examples given:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,15,zup
"Based on the examples given, it seems that the word ""zup"" does not have a fixed color output, as it changes depending on the context. It appears to function as a modifier that changes the color associated with the following word. Here is what we can induce from each of the examples:

- dax walm zup lug walm: here, ""dax"" and ""walm"" appear together without ""zup"" and produce ""green green"". When followed by ""zup,"" ""lug"" turns into ""yellow blue"" instead of its usual blue, and ""walm"" becomes ""blue,"" showing that ""zup"" changes the color output after it.
- wif zup: ""wif"" on its own is ""red,"" and when followed by ""zup,"" the output next is ""yellow.""
- zup dax zup dax wif bluf: ""zup"" precedes both ""dax"" instances, each time making the output ""yellow"" followed by ""green."" This indicates that ""zup"" modifies the following word's color output to ""yellow."" Also, ""wif"" and ""bluf"" stand-alone, producing two ""reds.""
- lug zup: ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and when followed by ""zup,"" it gives a ""yellow"" output.

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" could be that it changes the next color output to ""yellow"" regardless of what the next word's color would normally be.

Rule: zup -> changes the next color output to yellow.",1.0,15,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" correlates with the output ""yellow"" regardless of the input word it follows. Here's the observed correspondence:

- dax walm zup -> green green green
- wif zup -> red yellow
- zup dax zup dax wif bluf -> yellow green yellow green red red
- lug zup -> blue yellow
- lug zup -> blue yellow

In each case, regardless of the context, the presence of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output. 

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,15,zup
"Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on its position in the sequence. It appears to take on the color of the word that precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" (as in ""lug bluf""), the output is blue for both words.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" (as in ""dax bluf""), the output is green for both words.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" (as in ""zup bluf""), the output is yellow for both words.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes the color of the preceding word in the sequence.

bluf -> meaning: Bluf takes the color of the word directly before it.",1.0,15,bluf
"Analyzing the patterns in the given inputs and outputs, we'll try to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"":

Here are the patterns:

- Whenever ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the output is ""green green"".
- Whenever ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"", the output adjacent to ""wif"" is ""red"".
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the output adjacent to ""zup"" is ""yellow"".
- In the instances where ""lug"" surrounds ""bluf"", the output for ""lug"" is ""blue"".

So it seems ""bluf"" does not have a fixed color assigned to it; rather, its output is influenced by the context of the surrounding words. However, from the first bullet point, we can note that whenever ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it results in ""green"". Since ""dax"" itself translates to ""green"" based on other patterns, we might consider ""bluf"" to echo the color of the word preceding it, at least in this context. 

However, in every instance given, no matter the context, the output for ""bluf"" is always ""green"":

- dax bluf -> green green
- lug bluf -> blue green
- bluf dax -> green green
- zup bluf -> yellow green

Given this consistent output where ""bluf"" results in ""green,"" we can determine:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" regardless of the context.

So, based on the examples provided:

bluf -> green",1.0,15,bluf
"By examining the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" directly translates to the color ""blue"" in each instance. Here is the supporting evidence from the examples:

- In the first example, when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which means green, the output is ""green green blue red.""
- In the second example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" implying that ""bluf"" is also ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" appears at the end, and the last output color is yellow. This does not help in this case, as the ""zup"" is yellow.
- The fourth example again shows that after ""dax"" means green, ""bluf"" again corresponds to the color blue.
- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red. However, the color matching ""bluf"" is not shown in this sequence, as the input sequence ends with ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> blue",0.8,15,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern where each input word corresponds to a specific output color. Let's match the input words to their output colors:

Input: dax bluf lug wif

Input: lug bluf dax lug
Output: blue blue green blue

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
Output: green green red yellow red

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

From these, we can derive the following associations:
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow

The word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color green, except when followed by ""wif"" where it changes to red. However, the sample size of examples involving ""bluf"" and ""wif"" is too small to draw a definitive rule for the interaction. We see ""bluf"" followed by ""wif"" only once and it results in ""bluf"" being green and ""wif"" red.

Given this, the simplest consistent rule is:

Rule: bluf -> green

This rule is consistent with the majority of provided examples where ""bluf"" directly corresponds to ""green"" without surrounding contextual dependency indicated in the examples. However, more examples especially ones with ""bluf"" and ""wif"" in different positions relative to one another would be necessary to further verify or refine this rule.",0.8,15,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red if the word after it is wif, otherwise bluf -> green.",0.8,15,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rules for the nonce word ""walm"":

1. In the first example, ""walm"" appears after ""wif"" and the output is ""red red"" which corresponds to the color that follows ""wif."" This suggests that ""walm"" may replicate the color of the preceding word.

2. In the second example, ""walm"" immediately repeats the color ""green"" which corresponds to ""dax."" However, the third ""walm"" leads to three ""red,"" which corresponds to the preceding word ""wif."" This strengthens the suggestion that ""walm"" replicates the color of the preceding word, and it seems to replicate it as many times as ""walm"" has been used consecutively in the sentence.

3. In the third example, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow."" Since ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and we see repeated ""yellow,"" it supports the observation that ""walm"" replicates the previous color. Because there are no other colors or words before ""zup"" to guide the color replication, the replication continues the last known color, in this case, ""yellow.""

4. In the fourth example, multiple ""walms"" after ""zup"" lead to multiple ""yellow."" There is a single ""walm"" after ""wif"" and it results in a single ""red."" Hence, ""walm"" replicates the preceding color and the number of replications appears to equal the number of consecutive ""walm"" usages.

5. In the fifth example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" There is no other word between ""dax"" and ""walm,"" which suggests that ""walm"" can replicate the color of ""dax"" multiple times.

Rule: ""walm"" when used after a color word, replicates the output color related to that word, and it does so as many times as ""walm"" appears consecutively.

Therefore, walm -> meaning: Replicates the color output of the preceding word for as many times as ""walm"" is used consecutively.",1.0,15,walm

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Let's analyze the provided examples to deduce the rule:

1. In ""dax wif walm lug zup,"" the word ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" The output is ""green red red red,"" which means ""walm"" leads to a repetition of ""red"" (the color associated with ""wif"").

2. In ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" the word ""walm"" first follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" resulting in ""green green green."" Then, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" corresponding to ""red,"" resulting in ""red red red."" 

3. In ""zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" implying that ""walm"" caused the repetition of ""yellow,"" the color for ""zup.""

4. In ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" following ""wif"" (red), ""walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" and following ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" causes ""yellow yellow yellow.""

5. In ""dax walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), and the output is ""green green green,"" signifying the repetition of ""green"" for ""walm.""

- In the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is followed immediately by ""walm"" which is also ""green"". This happens twice.
- The third example shows ""zup walm"" translating to ""yellow yellow yellow"", indicating that ""walm"" is repeating the color of the preceding word, which is ""zup"" for ""yellow"".

1. ""zup lug zup dax"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow green,"" so ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow."" We know ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" ""Bluf"" does not have a direct color association from this example alone, but it appears to not affect the color output, as ""zup"" is yellow whether ""bluf"" is present or not.

3. ""zup walm dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue."" ""Zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""dax"" is ""green"" as previously established. The word ""lug"" at the end generates ""blue,"" so the additional ""walm"" here seems to correspond to ""yellow"" since it doesn't alter the sequence of ""yellow"" and follows ""zup.""

4. ""dax zup dax walm"" translates to ""green yellow green green green."" ""Dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and from the previous example, ""walm"" is ""yellow."" However, ""walm"" here only correlates with ""green."" It could indicate that ""walm"" becomes ""green"" when following a ""dax,"" or ""walm"" is affected by preceding words in the input.

5. ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" ""Dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" Looking at all the previous examples, ""walm"" generates either ""green"" or ""blue"" depending on context, possibly adopting the color that comes immediately before it.

In all examples, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of position and surrounding words. We can definitively conclude:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,16,dax
"The examples provided for the nonce word dax show a pattern in which dax corresponds to a certain color. Here is how one can deduce the meaning based on the examples:

1. In all cases where dax is present, the word 'green' appears in the output.
2. No other input word consistently maps to 'green' across all examples.
3. When dax is adjacent to certain words, those words seem to dictate the number of times 'green' appears in the output.

Here is the pattern deduced from the examples:

- ""dax"" by itself translates to ""green.""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" following ""dax"" causes repetition of ""green"" for every ""walm"" present.

Based on these observations, I can formulate the rule for dax:

dax -> translates to ""green"" but can also influence repetition of ""green"" when followed by the word ""walm.""

Rule: When dax is followed by ""walm,"" repeat the word ""green"" for as many times as ""walm"" appears.",1.0,16,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we need to deduce the meaning of the word ""dax"" in the given context.

Input: zup lug zup dax
Output: yellow blue yellow green
- Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". Since ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" after two instances of ""yellow"", it could mean ""green"" or a pattern leading to ""green"".

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow
- ""dax"" translates to ""green"" at the beginning, and since ""bluf"" hasn't appeared in previous examples, it's impossible to deduce its meaning just yet. But ""zup"" still means ""yellow"".

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
- ""zup"" and ""lug"" retain their meanings of ""yellow"" and ""blue"" respectively. ""walm"" seems to translate to ""yellow"" as well, considering its position in the input and output. Again, ""dax"" is associated with ""green"", following a pattern of ""yellow"" inputs.

Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green
- ""dax"" appears twice and both times it corresponds to ""green"". ""zup"" remains ""yellow"", and ""walm"" now seems to consistently correspond with ""yellow"" too.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- ""dax"" at the beginning is ""green"", ""lug"" is ""blue"" followed by ""walm"" which once again is ""blue"".

Given the consistent appearance of ""green"" after the word ""dax"" in every example, it seems clear that regardless of position, ""dax"" translates to ""green"". It does not appear to be position-dependent or contextually variable based on these examples.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,16,dax
"Based on the examples, we can infer that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"". However, we also notice that the repetition and placement of words in the inputs affect the outputs, leading to the repetition of certain colors. 

The word ""zup"" seems to consistently translate to ""yellow"", whereas ""lug"" is always followed by ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to be followed by repetitions of ""blue"" or ""green"" depending on the word that precedes it. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green,"" and when ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""

Rule: dax -> green. When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" or ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" the following word's color is repeated in the output. ""Zup,” on the other hand, maintains a one-to-one relationship with ""yellow"" without affecting repetitions.",0.8,16,dax
"Analyzing the examples:

1. ""zup lug zup dax"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow green.""
2. ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow.""
3. ""zup walm dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue.""
4. ""dax zup dax walm"" translates to ""green yellow green green green.""
5. ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue.""

Zup consistently translates to yellow. The word walm always results in a repetition of the color word immediately before it in the sequence. Lug's output is blue unless it follows a dax, in which case it changes the following colors to blue unless interrupted by a zup or another dax.

Now, let's deduce the rule for dax.

- In the first example, dax corresponds with green.
- In the second example, dax precedes zup and translates again to green.
- In the third example, dax follows zup walm and translates to green, also making lug translate to green.
- In the fourth example, dax leads to a sequence of repeated greens.
- In the fifth example, dax leads to a repeated sequence of blues after lug.

Rule: dax translates to green and influences the following color word to repeat the color mentioned right before dax. If followed by lug, it creates a sequence of blues unless interrupted by zup or another dax.

Therefore, the rule for dax is:

dax -> Rule: dax translates to green and influences the following color words to repeat the preceding color until another color word (zup) or another dax appears. If followed by lug without interruption, it creates a sequence of the color blue.",0.8,16,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" is associated with the color red. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the color red appears in the corresponding output. Thus, the rule seems to be as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,16,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color word ""yellow."" Regardless of the context in which ""zup"" appears, it consistently results in ""yellow"" in the output. Hence, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,16,zup
"Rule: bluf -> yellow

When evaluating the inputs and corresponding outputs, one can notice that each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. Despite the varied position of ""bluf"" in different inputs, its presence consistently results in the word ""yellow"" in the output. No contextual variations or conditions appear to change this relationship, making it reasonable to conclude that ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""",0.0,16,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, each nonce word seems to correspond to a specific color in the output. In each example, the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

bluf -> yellow",0.0,16,bluf
"Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" 

bluf -> yellow",0.0,16,bluf
"Given the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" by looking at the input and output. It seems that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. Let's identify the relationship:

1. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
2. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
3. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
4. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Now let's identify the pattern for ""bluf"":

- In every instance where ""bluf"" appears, the corresponding output is ""yellow"" or ""green"" in a pattern where ""bluf"" is first followed by ""yellow"" and if it appears again or repeatedly without the intervening occurrence of a ""dax,"" it continues to correspond to ""yellow."" When ""dax"" is present after ""bluf,"" then the next occurrence of ""bluf"" maps to ""green"" again.

Analyzing each scenario for ""bluf"":
- In example 1: bluf -> red, but immediately followed by ""lug,"" the meaning of which we've determined to be ""blue.""
- In example 2: two consecutive ""bluf"" map to ""yellow"" and then ""blue,"" but only after ""dax"" has appeared in between consecutive ""bluf"" instances, it's ""green.""
- In example 3: since ""bluf"" is preceded by different words, not ""dax,"" we again see bluf -> red.
- In example 4: ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and therefore bluf -> green.
- In example 5: ""bluf"" is followed again by a ""dax,"" so it's bluf -> yellow (consistent with the pattern).

Given this information, it seems that ""bluf"" does not have a fixed color output, rather it seems to be dependent on what word precedes it, specifically if ""dax"" is present before ""bluf"".

So, analyzing it closely, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is present, its color output depends on its position relative to other words; ""bluf"" usually maps to ""yellow,"" but if ""dax"" precedes it, then ""bluf"" maps to ""green"" in the subsequent occurrence.

However, there are inconsistencies in the examples provided, particularly with the relationship between ""bluf"" and ""lug"" and the recurring ""bluf"" that does not consistently align with a particular color. There doesn't seem to be enough examples to form a conclusive rule for ""bluf."" Therefore, based on the available information, this rule is the closest approximation, but it is not definitive. More examples around ""bluf,"" especially without the words ""dax"" or ""lug"" involved, might be necessary to determine a more precise rule.",0.0,16,bluf
"bluf -> yellow

Rule: The word ""bluf"" appears to translate to the color ""yellow"" when looking at the series of inputs and their corresponding outputs. Each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" is in the corresponding position in the output.",0.0,16,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided. Let's break down each example and analyze the sequence of words relative to the sequence of colors.

1. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
   
   Here, ""walm"" is preceded and followed by ""red,"" except when it's before ""zup"" where it's followed by ""yellow.""

2. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   
   ""walm"" is preceded by ""blue,"" and followed by ""red.""

3. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   
   ""walm"" is preceded by ""yellow,"" and followed by ""yellow.""

4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   
   ""walm"" is preceded by ""blue,"" and followed by ""yellow.""

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   
   ""walm"" is preceded by ""blue,"" and no color follows since it's the last word.

From these examples, a few observations can be made:

- The output color for ""walm"" itself seems consistently to be ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" the color after ""walm"" is consistently ""yellow.""
- Other than when followed by ""zup,"" the color following ""walm"" seems to vary and might be influenced by surrounding words, but ""walm"" is always followed by the color corresponding to the next word.
- We also notice that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and seems unrelated to ""walm.""

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be elicited as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" and the color following ""walm"" is determined by the word that comes after ""walm,"" except when ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" in which case the color is always ""yellow."" 

Therefore:

walm -> blue",1.0,16,walm
"Rule: walm -> blue

The examples show that whenever the word ""walm"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. The presence of other words does not appear to affect this mapping, suggesting a direct translation from ""walm"" to ""blue.""",1.0,16,walm
"Looking at the given examples, we can try to understand the pattern of the output associated with the word ""walm"" in various contexts.

In the first example, the word ""walm"" correlates with the repetition of ""red"" in the output:
- Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
- Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

In the second example, ""walm"" is positioned between ""lug"" and ""wif"" and the color that corresponds to ""walm"" is ""blue"":
- Input: lug walm wif zup wif
- Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and its corresponding output is ""yellow"":
- Input: lug zup walm lug
- Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

In the fourth example, ""walm"" leads to a sequence of ""blue"" followed by the occurrence of ""lug"":
- Input: zup dax lug walm zup
- Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes the output sequence of ""blue"":
- Input: dax lug walm
- Output: green blue blue blue

From these examples, we can deduce:
- ""walm"" after ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"".
- ""walm"" after ""lug"" leads to a repetition of ""blue"".
- ""walm"" itself does not have a consistent direct color output since it changes depending on the context.
- ""walm"" generally triggers a sequence of the same color that follows it.

Considering this information, the color that follows ""walm"" in the input is repeated in the output sequence. Therefore:

Rule: ""walm"" -> introduces a repetition of the color corresponding to the subsequent word in the sequence.",0.8,16,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the relationship between the inputs and outputs. We're given several sequences containing the word ""walm"" and corresponding sequences in the outputs consisting of color names.

First, let's identify the colors associated with the known words so we can isolate the effect of ""walm"":
- ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red.""
- ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue.""
- ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" seems to be associated with the color ""green.""

Examining the sequences, ""walm"" appears between known words, and in the output, there are sequences where a color is repeated. We will assume that ""walm"" has a direct effect on the color(s) that follow it.

Now, let's look closer at the sequences:
1. When the sequence has ""walm"" followed by ""zup"" or ""lug,"" the color that immediately follows ""walm"" repeats. For instance, ""walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow"" and ""walm lug"" -> ""blue blue blue.""
2. When ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" we do not have multiple ""red"" in the output. It's possible that if ""walm"" is followed by the same word (""wif walm wif""), the effect of ""walm"" gets negated or changes.
3. ""walm"" alone followed by a non-repeated word makes the last mentioned color repeat. For example, ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color of the word immediately following it to be repeated three times. If ""walm"" is immediately preceded by the word it's followed by, its effect appears to be either negated or changed, as we see with ""wif walm wif.""",0.8,16,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples given.

In the first example, ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" corresponds to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow."" It's clear that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" when it appears at the beginning of the sequence, but not after ""walm zup.""

The second example, ""lug walm wif zup wif,"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red yellow red."" Here ""lug"" still starts with ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to also translate to ""blue."" ""Wif"" is still ""red,"" and ""zup"" ""yellow.""

The third example, ""lug zup walm lug,"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Since ""walm lug"" appears at the end and gives ""yellow blue,"" it implies that ""walm"" here does not correspond to ""blue,"" in contrast to the previous example.

In the fourth example, ""zup dax lug walm zup,"" corresponds to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow."" The word ""dax"" is new and corresponds to ""green."" We see that having ""walm"" after ""lug"" changes the next color to ""blue,"" regardless of what it would typically be.

The fifth example, ""dax lug walm,"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue."" Here ""dax"" is still ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" again influences the next color to be ""blue.""

From these examples, a pattern emerges that ""walm"" seems to change the color that follows it to ""blue."" Therefore, an attempt to define ""walm"" considering the patterns observed could be:

walm -> meaning: Causes the following word to correspond to the color ""blue.""

Rule: When ""walm"" appears before another word, it changes the output associated with that subsequent word to ""blue.""",0.8,16,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""lug."" Here is the analysis:

1. Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue
2. Input: wif lug dax lug -> Output: red blue green blue
3. Input: zup wif walm lug -> Output: yellow red red red blue
4. Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue
5. Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue

From examples 1 and 2, ""lug"" appears to produce ""blue,"" regardless of whether it follows ""dax"" or ""wif."" Furthermore, ""wif lug"" consistently leads to ""red blue"" in the output, as seen in examples 2 and 5. From this, we might deduce that ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red"" and ""lug"" correlates with the color ""blue.""

Moreover, ""lug walm"" in example 4 results in ""blue blue blue."" If ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" this would imply that ""walm"" on its own may also correspond to ""blue."" However, when we look at example 3, we see that ""walm lug"" follows three ""red"" which correspond to ""wif wif wif."" Given that ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" this might suggest that ""walm"" is a repetition operator, causing ""lug"" to repeat its output or color for the number of ""walm"" preceding it.

Taking these observations into account, the rule for ""lug"" may be determined as:

Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" When preceded by ""walm,"" it repeats the color ""blue"" for a number equal to the preceding ""walm"" count. When following other nonces like ""dax"" or ""wif,"" ""lug"" continues to correspond to ""blue.""",1.0,17,lug
"Rule: lug translates to the color blue. Whenever lug appears, the output is blue.",1.0,17,lug
"To determine the meaning of ""lug,"" we need to look at the patterns where it appears and the corresponding output.

- In example 1, ""dax lug"" outputs ""green blue.""
- In example 2, ""wif lug dax lug"" outputs ""red blue green blue."" This implies that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and since ""dax"" was earlier associated with ""green,"" it seems that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue.""
- In example 3, ""zup wif walm lug"" outputs ""yellow red red red blue."" This indicates that ""zup"" might correspond to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is confirmed as ""red."" ""walm"" is repeated three times, with ""red"" output for each occurrence, suggesting that ""walm"" might correspond to ""red"" as well. At the end, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" again.
- In example 4, ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" stands for ""blue,"" and since ""lug"" appears before ""walm,"" the sequence doesn't change the output of ""lug."" However, ""walm"" here is associated with ""blue,"" contradicting our previous inference that ""walm"" could be ""red."" This might imply that ""lug"" outputs ""blue"" regardless of its position and that the color for ""walm"" may vary depending on context or position, or there's another rule governing its output.
- In example 5, ""wif lug"" outputs ""red blue,"" which aligns with previous examples where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position or the other words around it.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,17,lug
"From the examples provided, we can deduce that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" This is evident because every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output. Additionally, other words in the input translate to different colors as well.

The example:

- Output: green blue

By examining all examples, it's clear that the word that precedes ""lug"" does not alter its output to ""blue,"" it consistently results in ""blue"" regardless of other words. The presence of ""lug"" in the input always leads to ""blue"" appearing at the corresponding position in the output.

2. In the second example, ""bluf"" produces the output ""red"" again, despite being between ""zup"" (yellow) and ""dax"" (green).
3. In the third example, regardless of being between ""wif"" (red) and ""lug"" (blue), ""bluf"" still maps to ""red.""
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is preceded and followed by ""lug"" (blue), and still, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" once more corresponds to ""red."" 

Given these observations, the rule is:

- ""lug walm"" --> ""blue blue blue"" (blue is repeated three times)
- ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" --> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"" (yellow is repeated three times)
- ""wif walm"" --> ""red red red"" (red is repeated three times)

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to indicate a repetition of the color associated with the word just prior to ""walm."" In each example, the word before ""walm"" has a direct color association, and the output is the repetition of that color three times. Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" signals a tripling of the color word that comes directly before it.

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to indicate the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Each example demonstrates the preceding word's color repeated three times following ""walm"".

For instance:

- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"",
- ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"",
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"".

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" would be: when following a color-indicating word, ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with that word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.",1.0,17,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to indicate repetition of the color word that precedes it three times. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first input, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""blue blue blue"". This suggests that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue and ""walm"" indicates that blue should be repeated three times.
- In the second input, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", and ""lug"" which was established as blue before follows ""walm"" after ""zup"" and before ""wif bluf"". The output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"", indicating that ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and that ""walm"" after ""zup"" produces three yellows. ""wif"" corresponds to red and ""bluf"" seems to repeat it, indicating doubling.
- The third input has ""wif walm"" and the output is ""red red red"". Again, ""walm"" causes the color (red, associated with ""wif"") to be repeated three times.
- The fourth input, ""dax walm wif"", results in ""green green green red"". ""Dax"" is associated with green and followed by ""walm"" produces three greens. ""wif"" as previously determined is red.
- In the fifth input, ""lug walm wif"" results in ""blue blue blue red"". ""Lug"" is blue and ""walm"" repeats it thrice, and ""wif"" remains red.

Walm -> meaning. Rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word, it causes that color word to be repeated three times.",1.0,17,walm
"Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the color word that corresponds to the word directly preceding ""walm.""

Explanation:

- ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue."" This implies that ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and the presence of ""walm"" results in the repetition of ""blue"" three times.
  
- ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" From this, we can deduce that ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" ""lug"" means ""blue,"" ""wif"" means ""red,"" and ""walm"" caused the tripling of ""yellow"" directly after it.
  
- ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red."" This further supports the idea that ""walm"" causes the tripling of the color associated with the word preceding it, since ""wif"" has been previously shown to mean ""red.""
  
- ""dax walm wif"" corresponds to ""green green green red."" Here ""dax"" must mean ""green,"" and ""walm"" continues to behave as expected by tripling the color associated with the preceding word.
  
- ""lug walm wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red."" The sequence remains consistent with previous examples, where ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""walm"" triples this color, and ""wif"" is ""red.""

Given these patterns, walm consistently causes the color word directly preceding it to be repeated three times in the output. Therefore:

walm -> three repetitions of the color word that corresponds to the word directly preceding ""walm.""",1.0,17,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the given context.",1.0,18,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output. No matter the position of ""lug"" in the input sequence or the other words surrounding it, the output corresponding to ""lug"" is always ""blue"". Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,18,lug
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Each instance of ""lug"" in the input correlates directly with the output ""blue.""

"Rule: wif -> red.

The examples show that whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.",1.0,18,wif
"Based on the provided examples, I can induce the following rule for the meaning of the word ""wif"":

In each example, the word ""wif"" precedes a word that corresponds to a color in the output.

- wif zup -> red yellow (zup corresponds to yellow)
- wif dax -> red green (dax corresponds to green)
- wif bluf -> red red (bluf corresponds to red)
- wif lug -> red blue (lug corresponds to blue)

So, the rule seems to be that the word ""wif"" precedes another nonce word and is translated to ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,18,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word translates to a specific color. The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,18,wif
"Observing the examples:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". The other words ""zup"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""yellow"" regardless of their position.
- In the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". The position does not seem to matter for the colors they correspond to.
- In the third example, ""wif"" is the last word and corresponds to ""red"" while ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" when it precedes ""wif"". This differs from the first example where ""bluf"" corresponded to ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again, ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"".
- In the fifth example, both appearances of ""wif"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""red"".

Throughout the examples, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"", regardless of its position in the sequence. The color representation of the other words seems to vary based on the position or the specific combination of words, but ""wif"" remains constant. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,18,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can analyze the outputs that correspond to each input to look for patterns related to the presence of ""wif"" and its position relative to other words.

1. Whenever ""wif"" is present, the color ""red"" is also in the output.
2. ""wif"" appears to correlate to the color ""red"" no matter its position in the input string.
3. Other words correlate to different colors no matter the position: ""zup"" seems to always correspond to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" seems to always correspond to ""red,"" and ""dax"" seems to always correspond to ""green.""
4. The color for ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and it appears just once.

With this in mind, we can deduce the meaning assigned to ""wif"" within this context:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,18,wif

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the word before it.,1.0,18,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" generates a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. The color outputs are matched with their preceding words as follows:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

In each case, the occurrence of ""bluf"" yields the color associated with the previous word twice in the output.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a word, it repeats the color translation of that word twice in the output.",1.0,18,bluf
"Based on the given input-output pairs, it appears that ""bluf"" when added to a sequence, it repeats the color pattern for the already mentioned colors/words before it. This is seen as when ""bluf"" is present in the sequence, there is a repetition of the color outputs that came before ""bluf"" in the same order.

Here are the examples broken down:

- Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow (The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and then ""bluf"" causes this color to be repeated.)
- Input: lug dax bluf -> Output: blue green green (The colors blue and green are repeated after ""bluf"".)
- Input: zup walm lug wif bluf -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red (The sequence ""yellow yellow yellow blue red"" is given before ""bluf"", and red is repeated after ""bluf"".)
- Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green (Same pattern of repeat after ""bluf"".)
- Input: lug zup bluf dax -> Output: blue yellow yellow green (The colors blue and yellow are repeated after ""bluf"" but ""dax"" after ""bluf"" corresponds to a new color green, not a repetition.)

Rule: bluf -> repeats the sequence of colors represented by the words immediately preceding it.",1.0,18,bluf
"Bluf -> the word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another word, the color output for that previous word is repeated.",1.0,18,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to have a rule for transforming the previous words into specific colors with a repeated pattern. The transformation rule depends on the words that precede ""bluf."" Each input word has an associated color:

- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""walm"" and ""wif"" don’t have a directly associated color output, but given the third example, it appears that the word following ""walm"" takes the color of the word preceding ""walm"" (yellow in this case), and the word ""wif"" appears to make the preceding word's color repeat once more (blue in this case).

When ""bluf"" is used after these words, it seems to dictate that the output repeats the color corresponding to each input word immediately before it once more.

Here's the rule based on the examples:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is placed at the end of a sequence of words, each word that has a designated output color is repeated once more in the output. If a word does not have a designated output, such as ""walm"" or ""wif,"" the context of surrounding words, as well as their repetition in the sequence, dictates the color output.

Therefore:
bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word(s) once more.",0.8,18,bluf
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the last mentioned color until a different color word is stated.,1.0,18,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it three times.

Let's examine the examples in detail to confirm this:

1. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   - Here, 'walm' follows 'zup,' which corresponds to 'yellow,' and 'walm' results in 'yellow' being repeated three times.

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - 'walm' follows 'wif,' which corresponds to 'red,' and 'walm' results in 'red' being repeated three times.

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - 'walm' follows 'lug,' which corresponds to 'blue,' and 'walm' results in 'blue' being repeated three times.

4. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   - 'walm' follows 'dax,' which corresponds to 'green,' and 'walm' results in 'green' being repeated three times.

5. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   - The first 'walm' follows 'lug,' leading to 'blue' repeated three times, and there is no second 'walm.' The rest of the colors match their corresponding words.

Therefore:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word immediately before it three times.",1.0,18,walm
"Observing the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the output color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm"". Here is the analysis based on the examples:

1. wif lug zup walm wif lug -> red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   The word after zup is ""walm"" and it repeats the color corresponding to zup which is yellow.

2. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
   The word before ""walm"" is ""wif"" and it repeats the color red, which corresponds to ""wif"".

3. lug walm -> blue blue blue
   The word before ""walm"" is ""lug"" and it repeats the color blue, which corresponds to ""lug"".

4. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green
   The word before ""walm"" is ""dax"" and it repeats the color green, which corresponds to ""dax"".

5. lug walm dax wif lug wif -> blue blue blue green red blue red
   The word before the first ""walm"" is ""lug"" and it repeats the color blue. The word before the second mention ""dax"" does not occur in this example, but ""dax wif"" seems to follow the same logic where ""dax"" implies green and ""wif"" red without repetition.

From these examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color output of the word immediately preceding it in the input.

Therefore: walm -> causes the next item(s) in the sequence to repeat the color of the previous item.",1.0,18,walm

"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color word that appeared immediately before it in the sequence an additional two times. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""wif lug zup walm wif lug,"" the word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color ""yellow."" After ""walm,"" we see ""yellow"" repeated two more times.
- In the second example, ""zup wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated two more times.
- In the third example, ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated two more times.
- The fourth example, ""lug zup dax walm,"" has ""dax"" before ""walm,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated two more times.
- In the last example, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated two more times before the sequence continues with different colors.

- ""zup"" alone would output ""yellow,"" thus ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow.""

Considering more complex examples:

- ""dax wif bluf"" consists of two separate parts. ""dax"" outputs ""green,"" and ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" outputs ""green,"" ""lug"" outputs ""blue,"" and ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red."" Since we have multiple instances of ""dax"" and ""lug,"" their outputs are interspersed accordingly.
- In the last example, we don't have the isolated outputs for ""walm"" and ""lug,"" but we can see that ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue"" and ""dax"" results in ""green."" With ""zup bluf,"" the result is ""yellow yellow"" as we established before.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be the repetition of the color output of the word just before ""bluf."" 

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.",0.9,19,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can analyze patterns in the given examples related to its position and the corresponding output.

1. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   - After ""wif dax zup,"" we see one green followed by one yellow and then three yellows after 'walm.'

2. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - After ""zup wif lug zup,"" we see red, blue, and yellow corresponding to 'wif', 'lug', and 'zup,' followed by three yellows after 'walm.'

3. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   - 'Dax' corresponds to green, and each instance of 'walm' corresponds to three occurrences of the color before it. We see three greens after 'dax,' followed by three reds after 'wif.'

4. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   - 'Zup' corresponds to yellow, 'lug' to blue, and then we see three blues after 'walm,' followed by 'wif' which is red, and 'dax,' which is green.

5. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   - After 'zup' (yellow) and 'lug' (blue), 'walm' leads to three blues appearing.

Based on these examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to appear three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> A nonce word that triples the output color of the word immediately before it.",1.0,19,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word directly preceding it, repeated three times. We can observe that:

1. In the first input, ""wif dax zup walm,"" we have the colors red, green, and yellow associated with ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"" respectively, and ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
2. In the second input, ""zup wif lug zup walm,"" the last color before ""walm"" is ""yellow,"" and the output after ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
3. In the third input, ""dax walm wif walm,"" the color before the first ""walm"" is green, and the output is ""green green green;"" the second ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which is red, and the output is ""red red red.""
4. In the fourth input, ""zup lug walm wif dax,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is blue, and the output is ""blue blue blue.""
5. In the fifth input, ""zup lug walm,"" again ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is blue, and the output is the same ""blue blue blue.""

From these observations, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.",1.0,19,walm
"Based on the provided examples, one can observe that the output colors change in a pattern depending on the position and occurrence of the word ""walm"" and other words in the input sequence. Here is how the correspondence appears to work, along with the rules that can be deduced:

- Each word in the input (excluding ""walm"") is mapped to a unique color in the output: ""wif"" -> red, ""dax"" -> green, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""lug"" -> blue.
- When the word ""walm"" is present, it seems to cause the color of the previous word to repeat in the output an additional number of times. The number of repetitions, including the first occurrence of the color, is equal to the number of times ""walm"" appears sequentially.

Let's apply these rules to the examples:

1. Input: wif dax zup walm
   - ""wif"" maps to red.
   - ""dax"" maps to green.
   - ""zup"" maps to yellow.
   - ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" once, so we get an additional yellow.
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   - ""zup"" maps to yellow.
   - ""wif"" maps to red.
   - ""lug"" maps to blue.
   - ""zup"" maps to yellow again.
   - ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" once, adding another yellow.
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: dax walm wif walm
   - ""dax"" maps to green.
   - ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"" once, so we get an additional green.
   - ""wif"" maps to red.
   - ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif"" once, so we get an additional red.
   Output: green green green red red red

4. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   - ""zup"" maps to yellow.
   - ""lug"" maps to blue.
   - ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" once, adding another blue.
   - ""wif"" maps to red.
   - ""dax"" maps to green.
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

5. Input: zup lug walm
   - ""zup"" maps to yellow.
   - ""lug"" maps to blue.
   - ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" once, adding another blue.
   Output: yellow blue blue blue

The rule for ""walm"" is: When ""walm"" appears in the input sequence, it causes the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word to be repeated in the output. The number of repetitions corresponds to the number of sequential occurrences of ""walm.""

Walm -> meaning. Rule: walm causes the color corresponding to the previous word to repeat, the number of repetitions based on the number of sequential ""walm"" occurrences.",1.0,19,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can try to determine the meaning or rule for the word ""walm"" by analyzing how it corresponds to the colors in the output.

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

In this example, the word ""walm"" corresponds to three repetitions of ""yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" may signify a repetition of the preceding color.

Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""walm"" follows two occurrences of ""zup"" (yellow), after which it is followed by three instances of ""yellow."" This supports the repetition rule posited from the first example.

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red

In this example, “walm” directly follows ""dax"" (green) and then ""wif"" (red), each resulting in a triple repetition of the color that comes just before ""walm."" This reinforces the rule that ""walm"" corresponds to a triple repetition of the previous color.

Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" leading to three ""blue"" in the output. After wif and dax (red and green) there are no repetitions, which is consistent with the rule since ""walm"" is not present after them.

Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue

Again, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), and there is a triple repetition of ""blue"" in the output.

From these examples, we can deduce that the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

""walm"" -> Repeats the preceding color three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, it should be replaced with three instances of the immediately preceding color in the output.",1.0,19,walm
"Analyzing the given input and output pairs, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color that directly precedes it in the sequence. Whenever the word ""walm"" appears, the color that is outputted right before ""walm"" is repeated as many times as ""walm"" appears.

Let's break down the examples to explore this pattern:

1. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
- The word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color yellow, and after ""walm,"" we see ""yellow"" repeated three times.

2. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
- The word before the last instance of ""walm"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, and subsequently, ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

3. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
- The word before the first ""walm"" is ""dax,"" corresponding to green, which is then repeated twice more. The word before the second ""walm"" is ""wif,"" corresponding to red, which is also repeated twice more.

4. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
- The word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, and ""blue"" is repeated thrice.

5. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
- The word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, and ""blue"" is repeated thrice.

Therefore, based on the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to mean the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that appears directly before it.

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the relationship between the occurrences of 'walm' and the corresponding outputs.

In every example, 'walm' follows a word and precedes a set of three colors in the output that are identical. Moreover, the repeated color in the output corresponds to the color tied to the word that comes immediately before 'walm.'

Here's the breakdown:
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that 'walm' may mean repeat the color associated with 'zup' three times.
- ""dax zup dax walm"" leads to ""green yellow green green green,"" so 'walm' following 'dax' leads to ""green green green.""
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" reinforcing the idea that 'walm' means repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.
- ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red,"" again showing the repeated color corresponding with the word before 'walm.'
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" which follows the established pattern of tripling the color tied to the word before 'walm.'

"Rule: zup -> yellow

Each occurrence of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the sequence or the words around it.",1.0,21,zup
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word 'zup' correlates with the output of 'yellow.' Each input that contains 'zup' has a corresponding 'yellow' in the output. No other unique color is consistently paired with any single word from the inputs other than 'zup.'

According to the examples:

- Whenever 'zup' appears once in the input, 'yellow' appears once in the output (first, second, and third examples).
- When 'zup' appears twice in the input, 'yellow' appears twice in the output (fifth example).
- 'zup' does not determine the colors corresponding to other words like 'dax,' 'wif,' 'lug,' or 'walm,' which are paired with 'green,' 'red,' 'blue,' and 'blue,' respectively.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

zup -> yellow. Rule: The word 'zup' in the input results in the color 'yellow' in the output.",1.0,21,zup
"To induce the rule for ""zup,"" let's first isolate the instances of ""zup"" within the examples and examine the corresponding output:

1. Input: zup walm dax | Output: yellow yellow yellow green
2. Input: zup dax | Output: yellow green
3. Input: zup dax wif | Output: yellow green red
4. Input: lug walm zup lug walm | Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
5. Input: zup dax zup wif | Output: yellow green yellow red

By examining the inputs and outputs where ""zup"" appears, we can deduce the following:

- In every instance where ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output.
- ""zup"" does not seem to alter the colors associated with the following words. The words following ""zup"" (e.g., ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""wif"") still produce the same output colors regardless of whether ""zup"" precedes them.

Based on this, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be that it directly corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Therefore, the induction for ""zup"" would be:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,21,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the items following ""zup,"" (e.g., ""walm,"" ""dax,"" ""wif,"") correspond to particular colors (""yellow,"" ""green,"" ""red,"" respectively). However, this pattern relies on ""zup"" being present as a precursor. The word ""lug"" appears to correspond to the color ""blue,"" but its output does not prefix with ""yellow"" from ""zup,"" suggesting that ""zup"" does not carry meaning by itself and rather signals that the following word should be translated to its corresponding color. Without ""zup,"" the words retain their color meanings without a preceding ""yellow.""

Therefore, ""zup"" acts as a kind of highlighter or indicator that does not have a standalone meaning but affects the interpretation of the following word(s). If ""zup"" precedes a color word, it prompts the output to include ""yellow"" before the color associated with the subsequent word.

Rule: ""zup"" functions as an indicator to prepend ""yellow"" to the output corresponding to the next word's predefined color. If the sequence is ""zup X,"" then the output should start with ""yellow"" followed by the color coded to ""X."" When ""zup"" is not present, words directly translate to their associated colors without the ""yellow"" prefix.",0.9,21,zup
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" triggers a rule where the output color depends on the following word. Here's how the rule applies:

1. When ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output color is yellow.
2. When ""zup"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output color is yellow if ""zup"" is the first word in the sequence, and green if ""dax"" is the immediate next word (regardless of ""zup's"" position).
3. When ""zup"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output color is red.

However, in the fourth example, ""lug walm zup lug walm,"" the word ""zup"" does not seem to affect the color output for the words that follow it since the sequence of colors remains ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue."" This could mean that ""zup"" doesn't change the output of ""lug"" and ""walm"" that come after it. Moreover, ""zup"" itself is not assigned a color in this sequence.

Given this, it appears that ""zup"" changes the color of the immediate next word to yellow if that word is ""walm"" or ""dax"" and to red if that word is ""wif."" If ""zup"" does not precede these specific words or no word at all, it does not generate a color by itself (perhaps the 'output' is silent or nonexistent). However, when ""zup"" comes after ""walm"" without a word following ""zup,"" as in ""lug walm zup lug walm,"" it results in a yellow output.

Rule: ""zup"" affects the output color of the immediate following word, producing yellow when followed by ""walm"" or ""dax,"" and red when followed by ""wif."" If ""zup"" does not precede a word, or the context does not include ""walm,"" ""dax,"" or ""wif"" after ""zup,"" then ""zup"" does not have an output color.",0.8,21,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns in the given examples by breaking down each input-output pair:

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   The first word ""wif"" generates ""red,"" and ""bluf"" appears to repeat the color produced by the preceding word.

2. Input: wif zup bluf
   Output: red yellow yellow
   The word ""wif"" generates ""red,"" ""zup"" generates ""yellow,"" and again ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word, which is ""yellow.""

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   The patterns hold with ""wif"" leading to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" repeats the color ""yellow"", ""lug"" introduces ""blue,"" and ""walm"" has no direct precedent but seems to continue the color pattern from ""lug.""

4. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red
   ""Dax"" introduces ""green,"" ""wif"" gives ""red,"" and ""bluf"" again repeats the color of the preceding word, ""red.""

5. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
   Output: green green red yellow blue
   Here ""dax"" results in ""green,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which gives ""green"" again. This pattern is consistent with the previous instances where ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word.

Based on the observed patterns, it appears that ""bluf"" repeats the color given by the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the previous word in the sequence.",1.0,21,bluf
"Based on the given examples, one can deduce that the word ""bluf"" repeats the output of the color word that immediately precedes it. The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes the color indicated by the word right before it, and doubles the output for that specific color. 

Here is the breakdown of the rule following each example:

Example 1:
""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
- 'wif' translates to 'red', 'bluf' doubles the 'red'.

Example 2:
""wif zup bluf"" -> ""red yellow yellow""
- 'zup' translates to 'yellow', 'bluf' doubles the 'yellow' following 'wif' which still translates to 'red'.

Example 3:
""wif zup bluf lug walm"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue""
- 'zup' translates to 'yellow', 'bluf' doubles the 'yellow'; 'lug' translates to 'blue', 'walm' must also mean 'blue' as it produces two more 'blue's, 'walm' being redundant after 'lug'.

Example 4:
""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""
- 'dax' translates to 'green', 'wif' translates to 'red', and 'bluf' doubles the 'red'.

Example 5:
""dax bluf wif zup lug"" -> ""green green red yellow blue""
- 'dax' translates to 'green', 'bluf' doubles the 'green', following the earlier colors 'wif' turns to 'red', 'zup' to 'yellow', and 'lug' has previously been established to mean 'blue'.

Based on the above analysis, the rule is:
Rule: bluf -> Doubles the color of the word that precedes it.",1.0,21,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns in the given inputs and their corresponding outputs:

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm | Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   - ""wif"" leads to ""red""
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""
   - Following ""bluf"" there are two additional ""blue""

4. Input: dax wif bluf | Output: green red red
   - ""dax"" leads to ""green""
   - ""wif"" leads to ""red""
   - Following ""bluf"" there is another ""red""

5. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug | Output: green green red yellow blue
   - ""dax"" leads to ""green""
   - Following ""bluf"" there is another ""green""
   - ""wif"" leads to ""red""
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""

Given these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it doubles the output color of the word that precedes it. It results in the duplication of the color associated with the word before ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> Doubles the output color of the preceding word.",1.0,21,bluf
"Observing the patterns in the Input/Output pairs, the term ""bluf"" seems to translate directly to ""red red."" The word ""bluf"" itself is consistently outputting two instances of the word ""red."" However, looking at the presence of other words alongside ""bluf,"" such as ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" and ""dax,"" it seems that each of these has its own color output, which may be repeated once or multiple times dependent on the word that precedes it.

Here is how each word appears to be mapped to an output color or set of colors:

- wif -> red (repeated once to match the repetition in ""bluf"")
- zup -> yellow (repeated twice to match the repetition in ""bluf"")
- lug -> blue (repeated three times, indicating the repetition might increase by one with each subsequent word)
- walm -> (while not directly provided, follows the pattern after ""lug"", could possibly be blue blue blue)
- dax -> green, however, when ""dax"" appears before ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is still ""red red""

Rule:
bluf -> ""red red"" (the word bluf always translates to two instances of ""red"")

Each other word seems to follow a rule where:
- The word dictates a specific color.
- The number of times the color is repeated corresponds to the sequence of non-bluf words directly preceding ""bluf"" in the sentence.
- ""dax"" appears to be the exception, not influencing the repetition but rather having a fixed output of ""green"" per instance of ""dax.""

Given these observations:
bluf -> ""red red"" (regardless of the other words present in the sequence)",0.9,21,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should first look at each instance where it occurs and the corresponding output. 

1. ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red""
2. ""wif zup bluf"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow""
3. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue""
4. ""dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green red red""
5. ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" corresponds to ""green green red yellow blue""

Observing the pattern, we can notice several things:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the word directly following it (if any) is repeated in the output. This might indicate that ""bluf"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the next word.
- The word ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red,"" and when followed directly by ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
- The word ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow,"" when it follows ""bluf,"" the output contains ""yellow yellow.""
- The word ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue,"" and when following ""bluf,"" it results in ""blue blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax wif bluf"" leads to ""green red red,"" suggesting ""dax"" alone corresponds to ""green"" but ""wif"" is repeated due to ""bluf.""

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is followed by another word, the color associated with the next word is repeated.

Thus, the meaning can be deduced as:

bluf -> triggers the repetition of the next word's associated color in the output.",0.9,21,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the input and the corresponding output colors.

- In the first example, we have ""lug walm wif zup wif,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue red yellow red."" Here ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" ""wif"" results in ""red"" or ""yellow"" (the color changes in the sequence), and ""zup"" results in ""yellow."" ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""wif,"" and the color ""blue"" is repeated as if it's an extension of ""lug"" before a color change occurs.
  
- In the second example, ""zup walm"" corresponds with ""yellow yellow yellow,"" implying that ""walm"" extends the color of ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

- The third example, ""dax lug walm,"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" Here ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" again seems to extend the color of the word that precedes it, this time ""lug,"" hence the repetition of ""blue.""

- In the fourth example, ""wif dax zup walm"" corresponds with ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" It follows the pattern again, with ""walm"" extending the color of ""zup.""

- The fifth example, ""dax lug dax lug walm,"" correlates to ""green blue green blue blue blue."" ""Dax"" and ""lug"" are consistently ""green"" and ""blue,"" respectively, and ""walm"" again extends the color of ""lug.""

Given the above examples and analysis, the pattern for ""walm"" seems to be extending the color effect of the word immediately preceding it, resulting in a repetition of that color. So the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it repeats the output color associated with the immediately preceding word in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word in the output sequence.",1.0,21,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns before and after ""walm"" in the given examples. Let's analyze the input and output pairs, focusing on the appearance of ""walm"" and the corresponding outputs:

Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
Analysis: After ""walm,"" we have a repetition of ""blue,"" followed by ""red"" and ""yellow"" corresponding to ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif.""

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Analysis: After ""walm,"" we have a repetition of ""yellow,"" which is the color that corresponds to ""zup.""

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
Analysis: After ""walm,"" we again see a repetition of ""blue,"" which corresponds to ""lug.""

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
Analysis: After ""walm,"" we see a repetition of ""yellow,"" corresponding to ""zup.""

Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue
Analysis: After ""walm,"" there is a repetition of ""blue"" corresponding to ""lug.""

From these observations, we see that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately prior to ""walm"" to repeat until another color word is encountered or the sequence ends.

Hence, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to repeat.

Walm -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before ""walm.""",1.0,21,walm
"Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. For instance, in the first example, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, and when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is multiple instances of blue. This pattern is consistent across all examples; ""walm"" consistently replicates the output of the preceding word multiple times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the word before it multiple times.",1.0,21,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will look for patterns related to the presence of the word ""walm"" in the input sequences and their corresponding outputs.

1. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
3. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
4. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
5. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue

Looking at the above examples:

- Example 1 suggests that ""walm"" yields ""blue blue blue"" as it is followed by ""wif zup wif"" giving ""red yellow red"".
- Example 2 implies that ""walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow"" with ""zup"" preceding it.
- Example 3 indicates that ""walm"" produces ""blue blue blue"" and is preceded by ""dax lug"".
- Example 4 shows that ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" succeeding ""wif dax zup"".
- Example 5 shows that ""walm"" provides ""blue blue blue"" after ""dax lug dax lug"".

From the above patterns, it is apparent that ""walm"" seems to yield a triplicate color based on the word directly preceding it:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and is followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""

It appears that ""walm"" generates a repetitive sequence of a color word that corresponds to the color code of the preceding word, repeated three times. The outputs only repeat a color three times when ""walm"" is present. No other single non-walm words in the input lead to triple color repetition in the output.

Rule: walm -> ""walm"" is a function that repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.",0.8,21,walm
"Analyzing the provided examples and the corresponding outputs, we can identify a pattern correlating the nonce word ""walm"" with the output colors. 

In each case where ""walm"" appears, a sequence of ""blue"" follows. The number of ""blue"" colors in the output matches the number of words that precede ""walm."" This suggests that ""walm"" could generate a number of ""blue"" outputs equal to the count of words before it. No other word in the given inputs generates a sequence of colors; they all map to a single color.

Here's the observed pattern detailed:

1. lug walm wif zup wif -> blue blue blue red yellow red
The word ""lug"" comes before walm, generating two ""blue"" outputs.

2. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
The word ""zup"" comes before walm, generating one ""blue"" output repeated three times for an unknown reason. Since the entire output is yellow, this line is an exception or contains an error based on our rule.

3. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
Two words (""dax"" and ""lug"") come before walm, generating three ""blue"" outputs.

4. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow
Three words (""wif"", ""dax"", and ""zup"") come before walm, generating four ""blue"" outputs. Since the output does not contain blue, this line is another exception or error.

5. dax lug dax lug walm -> green blue green blue blue blue
Four words (""dax"", ""lug"", ""dax"", ""lug"") come before walm, generating five ""blue"" outputs.

Given the apparent inconsistency in inputs #2 and #4 with the proposed rule, the full meaning of ""walm"" may not be completely captured by the available data. However, excluding those lines as potential errors or exceptions, ""walm"" appears to produce a sequence of ""blue"" outputs that corresponds to the number of words preceding it.

Hence, the tentative rule, which partially fits the available data, is:

Rule: ""walm"" generates a sequence of ""blue"" outputs where the number of ""blue"" colors corresponds to the count of words that precede ""walm.""

Note: The exceptions in the input/output sequences suggest that there may be additional rules or context not provided in the examples that could influence the meaning of ""walm.""",0.6,21,walm

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input string or the context within that string. Other words in the examples seem to correspond to different colors (""dax"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red""), but ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,22,lug
"lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in every example provided.",1.0,22,lug
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present. Therefore, we can deduce:

Rule: lug -> blue

Meaning: The word ""lug"" represents the color blue.",1.0,22,lug
"dax -> meaning. Meaning is the color green.

Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is the color ""green.""",1.0,22,dax

Rule: When given the word ""dax,"" the corresponding output is ""green.""",1.0,22,dax
"dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""",1.0,22,dax
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" seems to correlate with a rule that determines the output of ""red."" This correlation can be deduced from the examples as follows:

- Each instance of the word ""wif"" in the input is followed by the word ""red"" at least once in the output.
- The number of times ""red"" appears in the output after ""wif"" seems to be dependent on the word that follows ""wif."" For example, ""walm"" leads to two additional ""red"" outputs, while ""bluf"" does not add an extra ""red.""
- The word ""dax"" affects the output before ""wif"" starts contributing, showing a single ""green"" unrelated to the presence of ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule might be formulated as follows:

Rule: The word ""wif"" causes the output to be ""red,"" with the number of ""red"" outputs potentially affected by the following word. Specifically, ""wif walm"" generates three ""red"" outputs, ""wif bluf"" generates two ""red"" outputs, and ""wif"" alone or followed by an unknown word results in an uncertain number of ""red"" outputs, but at least one ""red"" is guaranteed.

wif -> meaning. Rule: ""wif"" translates to an output of at least one ""red,"" with variations depending on the subsequent word.",0.9,22,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we should look at the patterns in which the word appears and the corresponding output. We can examine the relationship between the input and output sequences one by one.

First, let's break down the first three examples where ""wif"" is at the beginning:

1. Input: ""wif walm zup lug zup walm""
   Output: ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
   
2. Input: ""wif walm""
   Output: ""red red red""
   
3. Input: ""wif bluf""
   Output: ""red red""
   
In these three cases, the word ""wif"" precedes other words and is followed by ""red red."" When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" there is an additional ""red"" in the pattern. It’s consistent that the presence of ""wif"" is aligned with two or more ""red"" in the output.

Now let's analyze the other two examples, where ""wif"" is not at the beginning:

4. Input: ""dax wif walm lug zup walm""
   Output: ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow""
   
5. Input: ""dax wif dax zup bluf""
   Output: ""green red green yellow yellow""
   
In both these cases, ""wif"" is preceded by ""dax,"" which corresponds with ""green,"" followed by ""red red."" When it precedes ""walm,"" it again adds an extra ""red.""

Given these observations, it seems that the word ""wif"" followed by any word adds two ""red"" to the output, and when followed by ""walm,"" it adds an extra ""red,"" resulting in three ""red.""

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" could be formulated as follows:

Rule: When ""wif"" appears, output two ""red."" If ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" output three ""red.""

Or straigthly:

wif -> meaning: ""wif"" indicates the color ""red"" twice, and if ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" it indicates ""red"" three times.",0.9,22,wif
"Based on the given examples, each nonce word seems to correspond to a specific color output. Let's analyze and correlate the input with the output for the word ""wif"":

1. wif walm zup lug zup walm -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
2. wif walm -> red red red
3. wif bluf -> red red
4. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
5. dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow

The word ""wif"" consistently correlates with an output of at least one ""red"". When combined with ""walm,"" the presence of ""wif"" seems to add three instances of ""red"" in the output. However, when it follows ""dax"", it adds only one ""red"" after the ""green"" that corresponds to ""dax"".

From these examples, we can tentatively deduce the following about the word ""wif"":

wif -> meaning. When ""wif"" appears by itself or as the first word in the input, it corresponds to ""red red"". When it follows another word, it corresponds to a single ""red"" in the output. 

Rule: The word ""wif"" adds ""red"" to the output, with the number of ""red"" instances dependent on its position and perhaps the preceding word.",0.8,22,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to correspond with the output of red followed by an additional red for each subsequent syllable in the word that follows ""wif.""

Here are the observations leading to the rule:

1. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" outputs three reds for ""wif walm"" and then continues with the rest of the pattern unrelated to ""wif.""
2. ""wif walm"" outputs three reds, corresponding to ""wif"" plus one additional red for the one-syllable word ""walm.""
3. ""wif bluf,"" where ""bluf"" is a one-syllable word, results in two reds.
4. When ""wif"" is preceded by ""dax,"" it seems that ""dax"" itself translates to green, and then the rule for ""wif"" follows.
5. ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" follows the established pattern for ""dax,"" then ""wif,"" and it does not seem to affect the meaning of ""wif.""

Combining these observations, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be:

- ""wif"" corresponds to two reds,
- plus one additional red for each syllable in the word immediately following ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> For each occurrence of ""wif,"" output two reds plus one additional red for each syllable in the following word.",0.8,22,wif
"To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze each input and its corresponding output.

1. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm

3. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   
4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   
5. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow

Based on the provided examples, the occurrences of the word ""wif"" in the input always correspond with the color ""red"" in the output. Specifically, ""wif"" appears to add two or three reds in a sequence depending on the word that follows it. It is noteworthy that ""wif walm"" results in three reds, while ""wif bluf"" yields only two reds. It seems to depend on the next word; if the word after ""wif"" is ""walm,"" an additional red is produced.

However, it is unclear from the examples how ""wif"" might interact with different following words, as ""walm"" and ""bluf"" are the only ones provided after ""wif."" To assert a more precise rule, a larger variety of examples would be required. Still, with limited information, we can suggest a tentative rule:

Rule: ""wif"" produces two reds when it stands alone or is followed by a word that has not been demonstrated to affect the output sequence (as with ""bluf""). If followed by ""walm,"" it produces an additional red for a total of three reds.",0.7,22,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. When ""zup"" is combined with ""lug,"" the respective color representation of ""lug"" (blue) is added before or after ""yellow,"" depending on the order of the words.",1.0,22,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Whenever ""zup"" appears as an input, the corresponding output is ""yellow."" If ""zup"" is paired with another word, such as ""lug,"" the color that ""lug"" represents (""blue"") is also mentioned in the output sequence. The position of ""zup"" relative to ""lug"" affects the order of colors in the output, with the color associated with ""zup"" (""yellow"") mentioned first if ""zup"" comes before ""lug,"" and second if after.",1.0,22,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Explanation of the rule:
- When the input is ""zup"", the output is consistently ""yellow"".
- When ""zup"" is combined with another word such as ""lug"", the output becomes a combination of two colors with ""yellow"" always corresponding to the position of ""zup"" in the input.
- The word ""lug"" seems to correspond to the color ""blue"".

Rule: bluf means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word.,1.0,22,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" is followed by a color word. The color word that follows ""bluf"" is then repeated twice in the output. Here's the rule based on each line of examples:

1. lug bluf -> blue blue

2. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
   The word ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" leading to ""blue"" being output twice.

3. dax bluf wif zup wif -> green green red yellow red
   The word ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" which results in ""green"" being output twice.

4. dax bluf -> green green
   Same as above, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" resulting in ""green"" being output twice.

5. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

2. ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" so ""lug"" must correspond to ""blue.""
3. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" outputs ""green red red red blue yellow."" Here, ""wif"" comes before ""walm"" and the output is ""red red red,"" so ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" I will look at each instance and the corresponding output colors.

1. Input: dax walm wif bluf - Output: green green green red red
2. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax - Output: green green yellow yellow green
3. Input: dax lug wif walm - Output: green blue red red red
4. Input: zup dax lug zup - Output: yellow green blue yellow
5. Input: zup wif dax - Output: yellow red green

By examining the output patterns and considering where ""dax"" appears in each input, we can note the following:

- When ""dax"" appears at the beginning of a sequence, the corresponding output always starts with green.
- When ""dax"" appears at the end of a sequence, the corresponding output ends with green.
- When ""dax"" appears between two words that are different, the corresponding output for ""dax"" is green (see example 1, ""dax walm wif"").
- When ""dax"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the corresponding output is green (see example 4, ""zup dax"").
- When ""dax"" comes after ""wif,"" the corresponding output is green (see example 5, ""wif dax"").

From these observations, it seems that the output green is strongly associated with the presence of ""dax,"" regardless of its position or surrounding words. Therefore, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Based on the examples provided the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,23,dax
"To decipher the meaning of ""dax,"" one must look for patterns—how ""dax"" interacts with other words, and how those interactions are reflected in the color outputs. Let's compare the word ""dax"" with the resultant colors in each example:

1. In the first example, when ""dax"" precedes ""walm wif bluf,"" the output is three greens followed by two reds. This suggests that ""dax"" might have something to do with a sequence that starts correctly (green) but then turns incorrect (red).

2. In the second example, ""dax"" appears at the beginning and end of the input. Both times it produces a green in the output, while the middle ""bluf zup bluf"" produces ""yellow yellow.""

3. The third example begins with ""dax,"" resulting in a green, but then ""lug"" leads to a blue, and ""wif walm"" results in three consecutive reds.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" is surrounded by ""zup,"" which is correlated with yellow at both occurrences, while ""lug"" following ""dax"" results in blue, as previously observed.

5. The fifth example presents ""zup wif dax,"" correlating with ""yellow red green,"" where ""dax"" at the end, as before, results in green.

The pattern that emerges is that ""dax"" consistently correlates with green, regardless of its position in the sequence or what follows it. ""Dax"" doesn't seem to affect the colors associated with other words; instead, its role appears to be that it produces a green output when it appears. For the other words, their color output seems to be context-dependent or follows a different set of rules that are not immediately clear.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,23,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to analyze the input and corresponding output patterns:

Input 1: dax walm wif bluf
Output 1: green green green red red

Input 2: dax bluf zup bluf dax
Output 2: green green yellow yellow green

Input 3: dax lug wif walm
Output 3: green blue red red red

Input 4: zup dax lug zup
Output 4: yellow green blue yellow

Input 5: zup wif dax
Output 5: yellow red green

From these patterns, we can observe the following:

- Every time ""dax"" appears, ""green"" is the corresponding output.
- The word ""dax"" does not depend on its position in the sequence to correspond with ""green.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be quite straightforward:

dax -> green. 

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,23,dax
"To determine the meaning or rule for ""dax,"" let's analyze the patterns in the examples provided:

Example 1: 
- Input: dax walm wif bluf 
- Output: green green green red red 
- Observation: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the rest do not follow the ""dax"" pattern.

Example 2:
- Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax
- Output: green green yellow yellow green 
- Observation: Both instances of ""dax"" correspond to ""green,"" ""bluf"" to ""yellow,"" despite ""bluf"" being ""red"" in Example 1. This suggests ""dax"" has a consistent meaning but ""bluf"" does not.

Example 3:
- Input: dax lug wif walm
- Output: green blue red red red 
- Observation: ""dax"" remains ""green,"" the meanings of other words do not correspond to previous appearances.

Example 4:
- Input: zup dax lug zup
- Output: yellow green blue yellow 
- Observation: ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green,"" indicating consistency in its meaning.

Example 5:
- Input: zup wif dax
- Output: yellow red green 
- Observation: Once again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Considering all examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words. Other words such as ""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup"" change their corresponding colors between examples, which suggests their meaning is context-dependent or follows a different set of rules than ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green. ""Dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green,"" regardless of context or position within the input sequence.",1.0,23,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we'll look at where it appears in the input and the corresponding color in the output. Let's break down each example:

1. Input: dax walm wif bluf - Output: green green green red red
   - Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and ""wif,"" which both result in green.

2. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax - Output: green green yellow yellow green
   - ""dax"" appears at the beginning and end. The first ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"" (green), and the second ""dax"" is the last word resulting in green.

3. Input: dax lug wif walm - Output: green blue red red red
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" resulting in green.

4. Input: zup dax lug zup - Output: yellow green blue yellow
   - ""dax"" is preceded by ""zup"" (yellow) and followed by ""lug"" (blue).

5. Input: zup wif dax - Output: yellow red green
   - ""dax"" is at the end and results in green.

Looking at the patterns, ""dax"" results in ""green"" regardless of the position in the input or the words around it. Therefore, the rule we can deduce from these examples is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,23,dax
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,23,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following correlations:

- Whenever the word ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding location in the output.
- The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- In the last example, ""walm"" and ""lug"" seem to consistently translate to ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" respectively, before ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

So, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,23,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words surrounding it. Thus, the rule can be stated as:

"zup -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, zup consistently translates to yellow. So the rule would be:

Rule: zup translates to ""yellow"". If zup is followed by another word (like lug or bluf), that word is translated into a color as well (lug to blue and bluf to yellow). If zup stands alone, the output is simply ""yellow"".",1.0,23,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in every instance it appears.",1.0,23,zup
"zup -> yellow. The word ""zup"" appears to consistently correspond to the color ""yellow"" in this set of examples, regardless of whether it is followed by another word or not.",1.0,23,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of context.",0.8,23,zup
"zup -> yellow. Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow.""

""Zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of the context.",0.8,23,zup
"From the given data, the word ""bluf"" seems to directly influence the following word in the sequence to repeat its color. There's no instance of ""bluf"" being followed by more than one word, so it's not possible to determine from the given data whether ""bluf"" might cause a repetition of more than one subsequent word if presented in a series.

Rule: bluf -> causes the next word's corresponding color to repeat.",1.0,23,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, ""bluf"" consistently correlates to the color that matches the word preceding it. When ""wif"" is before ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" takes on the value ""red"" to match ""wif."" Similarly, when ""dax"" or ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output color for ""bluf"" matches the color output for ""dax"" or ""zup,"" respectively. Therefore, it appears that ""bluf"" refers to the duplication of the color indicated by the directly preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word before it.",1.0,23,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is mentioned in the input immediately before it. It acts like a repetition indicator for the color mentioned just before itself. To express this observation in the format of a rule:

"walm -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the rule for ""walm"" appears to involve repeating the color of the previously mentioned word.

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it. For instance, if ""dax"" is green, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green"".",1.0,23,walm
"Walm -> meaning. Meaning appears to be ""repeat the color associated with the previous word.""

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" is used after another word, the output repeats the color that corresponded to the preceding word's output. For example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" indicates that the color ""green"" should be repeated. Similarly, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" as ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" signifies repeating that same color for the following positions.",1.0,23,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" has the effect of duplicating the color output of the word that appears immediately before it. In each example, whenever ""walm"" is used, the color that is output right before ""walm"" is repeated after it as many times as ""walm"" appears.

Here are the analyses of the examples:

1. ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" -> The color sequence is ""blue green yellow green"" before ""walm"", and after ""walm"", the color ""green"" is repeated once, matching the occurrence of ""dax"" before it. Then ""wif"" translates to ""red"".

2. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> Before ""walm"", we have ""red"", which is then repeated for as many ""walm"" there are, in this case, just one ""walm"". This is followed by ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup"".

3. ""zup walm"" -> The output is ""yellow yellow yellow"", where the occurrence of ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow"") is duplicated twice due to ""walm"".

4. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" -> After the sequence ""yellow green"", ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated once before the sequence continues with ""blue red"". 

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is: 

walm -> meaning: ""walm"" causes the color output of the preceding word to be repeated. 

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word that translates to a color, the output for ""walm"" is the same color as that word. If ""walm"" occurs multiple times in a row, it continues to repeat the last color output before the first ""walm"".",1.0,23,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's look at its occurrences and the corresponding outputs:

1. lug dax zup dax walm wif -> blue green yellow green green green red
2. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
3. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
4. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
5. zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red

Analyzing the examples, we notice that ""walm"" occurs in different places within the input but consistently results in a specific color in the output:

- In Example 1, the word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" and the output color is ""green""; the word after ""walm"" is ""wif,"" and the color is ""green,"" which does not align with the ""wif"" to ""red"" rule observed in other examples.
- In Examples 2, 3, and 4, ""walm"" is preceded by different words but always results in multiple ""red"" in the output.
- In Example 5, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" which usually corresponds to the color ""blue,"" but in this case, we see ""green"" right after ""walm.""

Given the inputs and outputs, it seems that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word right before it. Therefore, ""walm"" seems to be a modifier that repeats the color output of the previous word.

walm -> Repeats the color corresponding to the previous word in the output.",0.8,23,walm

"From the examples provided, we can induce the following associations for each word:

- dax consistently translates to green.
- wif consistently translates to red.
- zup consistently translates to yellow.
- bluf appears once and is translated to yellow.

With these associations, the meaning of the nonce word dax can be determined:

"Based on the given examples, we can infer that each nonce word corresponds to a color. To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look at each instance where ""dax"" appears and note the corresponding output color.

- When the input is ""dax,"" the output is ""green."" 
- When the input is ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" the output is ""green red yellow yellow red red red."" ""Dax"" is the first word, so it aligns with the first color ""green.""
- When the input is ""dax zup wif,"" the output is ""green yellow red."" Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- When the input is ""lug zup dax walm,"" the output is ""blue yellow green green green."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- When the input is ""wif dax,"" the output is ""red green."" ""Dax"" aligns with ""green.""

Hence, we can conclude that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" There seems to be no dependency on context or position within the sequence of words.

The word ""zup"" hasn't appeared in the input without ""wif,"" but given its output is yellow when it follows ""wif,"" we might assume ""zup"" translates to yellow.

From the given examples, we can see that each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output. This pattern is consistent regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the sequence or the other words present. Therefore, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

"Rule: Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" translates directly to the color ""red"" in all instances.

- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red""

- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""

When ""wif"" appears:

- In the presence of ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" and ""dax,"" ""wif"" stands for ""red"" before any other colors are listed.
- In the presence of ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" still translates to ""red.""

So, it seems that regardless of the other words or their respective color translations, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,24,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" changes its meaning depending on the context. To deduce the rule, let's consider each instance:

1. Input: dax lug wif | Output: green blue red
2. Input: wif bluf dax walm | Output: red red green green green
3. Input: wif lug bluf | Output: red blue blue
4. Input: wif walm dax zup | Output: red red red green yellow
5. Input: wif lug dax | Output: red blue green

From the examples, it seems like ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" In instances where ""wif"" comes before other words, those words do not change their associated colors. However, after ""wif,"" the following words might or might not repeat the color associated with ""wif."" 

Let's refine the observations:

- ""dax"" always results in ""green""
- ""lug"" always results in ""blue""
- ""bluf"" results in ""blue"" when it comes after ""wif,"" and ""red"" when it precedes ""wif""
- ""walm"" results in ""green"" when it comes after ""dax"" and multiple ""green""s when it comes after ""wif""

Given the patterns seen with ""bluf"" and ""walm,"" it seems plausible that ""wif"" signals a change in the subsequent color pattern, possibly repeating the color ""red"" before returning to the default color associated with each word.

Therefore, we can infer that the rule for ""wif"" is:

Rule: When ""wif"" precedes a word, it changes the output for that word to ""red"". If ""wif"" follows a word, it doesn't affect the output color, and the words retain their original color associations.

Hence:

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in a sequence or the words around it.",1.0,24,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" appears to be consistent across all examples. In every instance where ""zup"" is mentioned, the output is ""yellow.""

Here are the examples with the corresponding color outputs for each word or phrase:

   Output: red yellow green green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""

2. Input: zup
   Output: yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" seems to correspond to repetitions of the preceding color, hence ""yellow"" repeated three times in this case.

4. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of the preceding color, hence ""yellow"" is repeated three times after ""zup.""

5. Input: wif zup lug zup lug

Therefore:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,24,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule for the word ""bluf"":

- In the first example, 'bluf' follows 'zup dax' and leads to the output 'yellow yellow'. 'zup' in other contexts seems consistently associated with 'yellow', while 'dax' with different contexts can result in 'green' or 'blue'. Seeing 'green yellow yellow' as the output for 'dax zup bluf' suggests that 'bluf' might reinforce or duplicate the color associated with 'zup'.

- In the second example, the pattern is similar to the first, with the order of 'dax' and 'zup' switched, resulting in 'yellow green green'. Notably, 'bluf' again coincides with the duplication of the color associated with 'zup'.

- In the third example, a longer sequence is present, and 'bluf' immediately follows 'wif'. We see 'red red yellow', where 'bluf' again seems to produce an output color that matches the color of the word it immediately follows (in this case 'wif' which corresponds to 'red').

- In the fourth example, 'zup bluf' leads to 'yellow yellow', reinforcing the idea that 'bluf' duplicates the color associated with the previous word.

- Finally, in the fifth example, 'zup bluf lug' results in 'yellow yellow blue', with 'bluf' again duplicating the color 'yellow' associated with 'zup', and 'lug' having a consistent association with 'blue'.

Putting it all together, the rule appears to be:

bluf -> duplicates the color output of the immediately preceding word

So when used after a word, 'bluf' results in the output color being the same as the color associated with the word that comes before it.",0.8,24,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the output each time the word is used in the input and find a pattern.

Here are the examples we have been given with the key word highlighted:

1. dax zup **bluf**
   - Output: green yellow yellow

2. zup dax **bluf**
   - Output: yellow green green

3. wif **bluf** zup wif lug dax
   - Output: red red yellow red blue green

4. zup **bluf**
   - Output: yellow yellow

5. zup **bluf** lug
   - Output: yellow yellow blue

Now let's look at the commonalities:

- In examples 1 and 2, ""bluf"" appears after different words, but the output is always either green or yellow, suggesting ""bluf"" might correspond to a color (green or yellow). However, the colors don't repeat in the same way relative to ""bluf"". In the first case, ""bluf"" yields yellow, despite ""dax"" yielding green, while in the second, ""dax"" yields green and ""bluf"" yields green again, suggesting ""bluf"" isn't tied to a singular color.
- In example 3, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"", as it is in examples 4 and 5, but here ""bluf"" leads to red while in the other cases it leads to yellow. Thus, ""bluf"" doesn't correspond to red in a straightforward manner. However, ""zup"" consistently leads to yellow, suggesting that ""zup"" could mean yellow, not ""bluf"".
- The output for ""bluf"" in examples 1, 2, and 4 seems to relate to the word just preceding it. When ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"", the output for ""bluf"" is green, the same as for ""dax"". When ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"" it always results in yellow, just like ""zup"".

From these observations, we can deduce a rule:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it. Thus, ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word in the output.

Therefore: bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word.",0.8,24,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule for 'bluf', let's take the color outputs and see how they relate to each of the inputs:

1. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
2. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
3. wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> red red yellow red blue green
4. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
5. zup bluf lug -> yellow yellow blue

Given that ""zup bluf"" always results in ""yellow yellow,"" we can infer that the word 'bluf' is associated with the color yellow when it follows the word 'zup'. The only instance where 'bluf' does not correspond to yellow is in the third example, where it is preceded by 'wif' and followed by 'zup'. Here, 'bluf' translates to red, which suggests that 'bluf's color representation may depend on the context, specifically on the words that come before or after it.

Now let's consider 'dax', 'zup', 'wif', and 'lug' and their color outputs:

- 'dax' appears to correlate with green, as seen in examples 1 and 3 (but it is followed by 'bluf' in example 1, and 'lug' in example 3, so it isn't clear if 'dax' directly corresponds to green or if it's affected by other words).
- 'zup' seems to correspond to yellow when it comes before 'bluf'.
- 'wif' corresponds to red in example 3 (and is followed by 'bluf', which in turn is followed by 'zup').
- 'lug' is consistent with blue in example 3 (and in example 5 when following 'bluf').

With the examples at hand, the meaning of 'bluf' is not entirely clear as it changes depending on preceding and maybe following words. However, the most consistent correlation is that 'bluf' results in yellow when it comes after 'zup'.

Rule: When 'bluf' follows 'zup', it corresponds to the color yellow. The color output for 'bluf' in other contexts is not consistently discernible from the provided examples.",0.8,24,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following:

- In the first and second examples, swapping ""dax"" and ""zup"" before ""bluf"" results in the first color word changing, indicating that ""bluf"" likely depends on the order/position or the word that precedes it.
- If ""bluf"" immediately follows ""zup,"" the result is ""yellow"" irrespective of what follows ""bluf,"" which can be seen in examples 2 and 5, and possibly reinforced by example 4.
- If ""bluf"" immediately follows ""dax,"" the result is ""green,"" as shown in example 1.
- However, example 3 suggests a more complex relationship because there are multiple color outputs associated with ""bluf"" where it's surrounded by other words (""wif"" and ""zup"").

Through careful examination:

- ""bluf"" after ""zup"" is consistently resulting in ""yellow.""
- The output of ""bluf"" after ""dax"" is ""green.""
- The relationship between ""bluf"" and other words (""wif"" or ""lug"") or positions is not as explicitly clear, so we will go with consistency observed with “dax” and ""zup.""

- No context is provided that links ""dax"" to any external conditions, sequences, or variations that would alter its meaning.

Given this information, it seems that ""dax"" translates directly to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words. Here is the formulated rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,25,zup
"In order to determine the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at the commonalities where ""zup"" appears in the examples and the color it translates to:

- In every instance where ""zup"" is present, the output is ""yellow.""
- It does not seem to matter where ""zup"" is located in the sequence or which words surround it; the output is consistently ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Thus, we can conclude:

- Each appearance of ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- Each appearance of ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

From these associations, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,25,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer a rule for what ""zup"" might mean by identifying patterns and correlations with the given colors.

Observations:

1. In every instance where ""zup"" appears, the color ""yellow"" is in the corresponding place in the output.
2. The word ""zup"" does not seem to affect the colors assigned to other words; those follow a different pattern.

Considering these observations, we can deduce that:

However, there's an inconsistency with the rule: the second example, ""wif bluf,"" outputs ""red red"" instead of ""red blue,"" which could suggest ""bluf"" after ""wif"" might output ""red"" regardless of what ""bluf"" by itself should represent. Thus, there's not a perfectly clear rule for what ""bluf"" represents when following ""wif.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the examples given and their corresponding outputs:

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

From these examples, we can observe that each occurrence of the word ""walm"" results in a repeat of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. For instance, in the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm,"" yellow is repeated three times. Similarly, in the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""walm,"" green is repeated two more times, for a total of three greens.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word in the sequence.",1.0,25,walm
"walm -> repeats the color of the previous word

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, it replicates the color that was translated from the previous word. For instance, if ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow""), then ""walm"" also means ""yellow"". If ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which translates to ""green""), then ""walm"" becomes ""green"". Essentially, ""walm"" takes the color meaning of the word immediately preceding it and continues that color for as many ""walm"" repetitions as there are.",1.0,25,walm
"walm -> repeat the color of the previous word. Rule: When ""walm"" appears, it means to repeat the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it, multiple times (determined by subsequent ""walm"" occurrences or until a new color word is presented).",1.0,25,walm
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word.,1.0,25,walm
"Given the examples, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that comes right before it a specific number of times. Let's analyze it step by step:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to yellow. ""Walm"" produces three additional yellows.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to green. Here, ""walm"" produces two additional greens.
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is green, resulting in two additional greens.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which is red, resulting in two additional reds.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which is red, leading to two additional reds.

From the pattern, it's clear that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word. However, the number of repetitions seems to be inconsistent at first glance. But if we look closely, we notice that ""walm"" repeats the previous color based on its position in the sequence, counting each initial color and instance of ""walm"" as a single unit.

Breaking it down:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is the third element in the sequence, hence it outputs the previous color three times.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is the second element, hence it outputs the previous color two times.
- In the third example, ""walm"" is also the second element, so it outputs the previous color two times.
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""walm"" is the third element in the sequence, and it outputs the previous color two times, which seems to contradict the previous rule.

Given this conflict, one possible explanation might be that there is a cap on the repetition count. Let's assume that the cap is three—meaning ""walm"" can repeat the previous color up to three times but no more. This would fit all examples except for the fourth and fifth, where ""walm"" should have then generated three reds instead of two.

To refine the rule further, we might consider the initial instance of a color to count as a repetition. If so, this is what we get:

- If ""walm"" is the second word, it repeats the previous color once, plus the initial color: 1 + 1 = 2 repetitions.
- If ""walm"" is the third word, it repeats the previous color twice, including the initial instance: 1 + 1 = 2 repetitions.

Using this adjusted rule where the initial instance of a color counts toward the total:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color output associated with the word immediately preceding it, where the total number of color outputs (including the initial instance of the preceding word's color output) equals the position of ""walm"" in the sequence, with the repetition count capped at three. If the initial color counts as one repetition, then additional repetitions for ""walm"" are one less than its position in the sequence, still capped at three. 

For example:
- Second position: 1 initial color + 1 repeat = 2 total
- Third position: 1 initial color + 1 repeat = 2 total (capped at 3, so the cap doesn't affect it)",0.8,25,walm

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,26,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to look for patterns in the given examples and their corresponding output. Let's analyze the input against the output, paying particular attention to the position of ""wif"" and the colors that are outputted alongside it.

1. zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red
2. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
3. wif bluf lug -> red red blue
4. dax wif dax -> green red green
5. dax wif zup -> green red yellow

From these examples, we can try to infer a pattern:
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in every output.
- The position of ""wif"" in the input does not affect the output color (it is always red).
- The color before and after ""wif"" varies depending on other words but ""wif"" itself always corresponds to red.

Based on the given examples, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,26,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can see that each word correlates with a specific color. The output colors change according to the order and combination of the words in the input. By looking at the instances where the word ""wif"" appears and the corresponding color in the output, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule associated with ""wif"".

In the first example, ""wif"" is positioned between ""lug"" and it corresponds to the color red in the output. 

In the second example, ""wif"" follows ""lug"" again and also corresponds to red.

In the third example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf lug"", and in the output, red precedes red blue.

In the fourth example, ""wif"" is between two ""dax"", and the output sequence is green red green, indicating that ""wif"" corresponds to red.

In the fifth example, ""wif"" is in between ""dax"" and ""zup"", and the output is green red yellow, aligning with ""wif"" being red.

Based on this analysis, it appears that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,26,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" correlates to a specific color in the output. However, ""wif"" does not correspond to a single static color; rather, it seems to change depending on its position among other words.

Let's observe the relationship between the position of ""wif"" and the corresponding color in the output:

- When ""wif"" appears after ""lug,"" the output color is red.
- When ""wif"" appears before ""dax,"" the output color is red.
- When ""wif"" appears before ""bluf,"" the output color is red.
- When ""wif"" appears in between ""dax,"" the output color is red.
- When ""wif"" appears after ""dax"" and before ""zup,"" the output color is red.

The consistent pattern in these examples is that regardless of where ""wif"" is positioned, the color in the output is always red. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,26,wif
"From the provided examples, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color in the output. The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input string. This direct correspondence doesn't seem to be affected by context or other factors, so the meaning of ""wif"" can be concluded based on this pattern:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,26,wif
"Observing the patterns, it looks like each word corresponds to a specific color:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- walm -> green
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> red

However, the word ""wif"" corresponds to different colors in different contexts:

- After ""zup dax walm lug"", wif translates to red.
- After ""lug"", wif translates to red.
- Between ""dax"" words, wif translates to red.
- After ""dax"", before ""zup"", wif translates to red.

It appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to red regardless of its position in the sequence.

Thus, the rule for ""wif"" can be deduced as:

wif -> red",1.0,26,wif
"Examining the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can determine a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"". Each word in the input appears to correspond to a color in the output. When we look at the contexts in which ""zup"" appears, it is always followed by a single output color ""yellow"". 

Since ""zup"" is consistently followed by ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that come before or after it, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,26,zup
"From the examples given, it appears that each instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output.

1. Input: ""zup walm"" corresponds to Output: ""yellow yellow yellow"", and ""walm"" must correspond to ""yellow"" as it appears twice following ""zup.""

2. Input: ""lug zup"" corresponds to Output: ""blue yellow."" Therefore, when ""lug"" comes before ""zup,"" ""lug"" must mean ""blue,"" and ""zup"" still means ""yellow.""

3. Input: ""dax wif walm lug zup"" corresponds to Output: ""green red red red blue yellow."" Since ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is preceded by ""wif"" twice, which corresponds to ""red"" twice, ""wif"" likely means ""red."" ""Lug"" again corresponds to ""blue,"" which leaves ""dax"" to correspond to ""green"" and ""zup"" is consistently ""yellow.""

4. Input: ""zup wif walm lug"" corresponds to Output: ""yellow red red red blue."" This example further confirms that ""zup"" is ""yellow,"", ""wif"" is ""red,"", ""walm"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""

5. Input: ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" corresponds to Output: ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue.""

""Lug"" is consistently ""blue,"" ""walm"" is ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue"" again.

Based on these observations, the meaning of ""zup"" across all examples is consistent:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,26,zup
"Based on the presented examples, it can be noticed that the output correlates with a color for each word. Each unique word has a specific color associated with it. Let's look closely at each example to understand the meaning of ""zup"".

Example Analysis:
1. ""zup walm"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow"" - ""walm"" is repeated and the corresponding color is also repeated.
2. ""lug zup"" gives ""blue yellow"" - ""lug"" appears in other examples and always gives ""blue"", so ""zup"" is correlated with ""yellow"" here.
3. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" gives ""green red red red blue yellow"" - by comparing with other examples, it can be inferred that ""dax"" correlates with ""green"", ""wif"" with ""red"", ""walm"" with red (since it repeats the color ""red""), ""lug"" with ""blue"", and ""zup"" aligns with ""yellow"".
4. ""zup wif walm lug"" gives ""yellow red red red blue"" - repeating the findings from previous examples, ""zup"" aligns with ""yellow"", ""wif"" with ""red"", ""walm"" repeats the color ""red"", and ""lug"" with ""blue"".
5. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" gives ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue"" - this confirms that ""bluf"" correlates with ""blue"", and ""zup"" is consistent with ""yellow"" based on its placement in the sequence.

Rule:
zup -> yellow",1.0,26,zup

Input: dax wif walm lug zup -> Output: green red red red blue yellow
Input: zup wif walm lug -> Output: yellow red red red blue
Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Looking at the outputs above, in every case ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" directly follows in the output. It does not seem to matter where ""zup"" is positioned within the input sequence or which words are around it.

Accordingly, we see that the word ""bluf"" causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated in the output:

- ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow""
- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red""

"Observing the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""walm."" Let's analyze how the word ""walm"" translates into the outputs:

- Whenever ""walm"" is in the input, the following word or words turn into a specified color repeated multiple times until a new color word appears or the sequence ends.

For example: 
- In the first input ""lug walm wif bluf,"" the word following ""walm,"" which is ""wif,"" translates to ""red"" until ""bluf"" changes the color to ""blue"".
- In the second input ""zup walm wif,"" the word following ""walm,"" which is ""wif,"" translates to ""red"" until the sequence ends.
- In the third input ""dax wif walm,"" the word following ""walm"" is not present, but the proceeding word ""wif"" then turns into ""red"" repeatedly.
- In the fourth input, after ""walm,"" the word ""dax"" turns into ""blue"" repeated until the next color indicator ""lug.""
- In the fifth input, ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax,"" after ""walm,"" the word ""dax"" turns into ""blue"" repeated until ""wif"" indicates a color change to ""red,"" which is then repeated until the sequence ends with ""dax.""

Now let's generalize the rule:

Rule:
- ""walm"" causes the color of the following word to be repeated for each subsequent word until a new color word appears.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" is:

walm -> Repeat the color of the following word until a new color word appears.",1.0,26,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word 'walm' is associated with a repetition of the color that immediately precedes it several times, followed by the color red one time less than the repetitions. Let's look closer at each example to see the pattern:

1. lug walm wif bluf
   blue blue blue red red
   'Lug' leads to the output 'blue' and is repeated three times, followed by 'wif' translated as 'red', which appears twice.

2. zup walm wif
   yellow yellow yellow red
   'Zup' leads to 'yellow' repeated three times, followed by a single 'red' (because 'wif' translates to 'red').

3. dax wif walm
   green red red red
   'Wif' as 'red' appears three times, 'dax' precedes it and translates to 'green' but does not get repeated.

4. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   Here 'lug' translates to 'blue' and repeats three times, then 'dax' translates to 'green' and interrupts the repetition of 'blue', resulting in only one 'green', followed by a 'blue' from the last 'lug'.

5. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   green blue blue blue green red red green
   'Lug' translates to 'blue' and is repeated three times, followed by 'green' from 'dax' once, then two 'red' from 'wif', and then 'green' from the final 'dax'.

To formulate a general rule:

- 'Walm' causes the color word that immediately precedes it to be repeated three times.
- After the repetition of the preceding color word, 'red' is added to the sequence one fewer times than the repetitions (in the given examples, 'red' appears only twice since 'walm' causes three repetitions).

So the rule is:

Rule: 'Walm' -> Causes the preceding color word to repeat three times, followed by 'red' occurring one time less than the repetition count. (In the provided context, the repetition count is three, so 'red' appears twice.)

However, the exact number of times the color and 'red' are repeated may depend on the unspoken rule linked to 'walm' and the sequence of tokens in the input. With the given data, it's assumed that the pattern is three repeats of the previous color followed by two reds.",1.0,26,walm
"Observing the patterns of input and output across the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm."" Let's analyze the patterns.

1. Every time ""walm"" is present, there's a repetition of the color that precedes its occurrence, followed by a switch to the next color listed after ""wif"" or ""bluf.""

Example 1: ""lug walm wif bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red red."" 
- ""lug"" translates to blue. After ""walm,"" blue is repeated twice more before switching to red after ""wif.""

Example 2: ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red.""
- ""zup"" translates to yellow. After ""walm,"" yellow is repeated twice more before switching to red after ""wif.""

2. When ""walm"" is followed by another word that translates to a color (other than ""wif"" or ""bluf""), the repetition rule still applies, but it's terminated by the introduction of the new color.

Example 3: ""dax wif walm"" translates to ""green red red red.""
- ""dax"" translates to green. Notice “dax” is not repeated because it comes before ""wif.""
- ""wif"" translates to red. After ""walm,"" red is repeated three times.

Example 5: ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue blue blue green red red green.""
- ""dax lug"" is ""green blue."" After ""walm,"" blue is repeated two more times before changing to green after ""dax."" The pattern continues with red after ""wif,"" and the last ""dax"" translates to green again.

3. The position of ""walm"" in relation to ""wif"" or ""bluf"" is crucial as it seems to determine when the repetition ends and a new color begins.

Based on these observations, it appears that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the previously mentioned color, with the repetition continuing until the next color word (not ""walm"") is mentioned. If ""wif"" or ""bluf"" immediately follows ""walm,"" then the switch is to ""red.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color until a new color word is encountered or switch to red if followed by ""wif"" or ""bluf.""",0.9,26,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we try to deduce the meaning or the rule for the nonce word ""walm."" We notice that ""walm"" always results in a series of colors that appears to begin with the color immediately preceding ""walm"" (if there is one), and then followed by a sequence of colors. The sequence consists of repeating the first mentioned color and ending with red. We have:

- ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue red""
- ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow red""
- ""dax walm"" produces ""green red red red""

This pattern is consistent regardless of where ""walm"" appears in the input. We can also see that the number of repeated colors before the ""red"" depends on the position of ""walm"":

- When ""walm"" is the second word, there are three repetitions of the preceding color before ""red"" (as shown in the first and second examples).
- If ""walm"" is the third word or later, there are two repetitions of the preceding color before ""red"" (as shown in the third and fourth examples).
- When ""walm"" occurs after two different colors, it seems to overwrite the first mentioned color repetition with the second mentioned color repetition (as shown in the fifth example where ""dax lug walm"" produces ""blue blue"", not ""green green"" as might be expected if only the immediate preceding color were considered). 

However, without more examples, particularly with ""walm"" placed in different positions relative to different color codes, it is challenging to solidify a rule regarding how many repetitions occur and under what conditions. Therefore, based on the examples given and without further evidence, the tentative rule we can draw is:

Rule: ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the immediately preceding color once or multiple times, followed by the color red. The number of repetitions seems to correlate with the position of ""walm"" in the sequence, but more examples are needed to define this aspect with confidence. 

This interpretation may not be entirely correct without additional evidence, but it is the best deduction given the information provided.",0.7,26,walm

"Based on the examples provided:

Here, dax corresponds to green, wif to red, zup to yellow, and bluf might correspond to yellow as well based on a single instance.

Again, zup corresponds to yellow and dax to green.

Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif

Lug corresponds to blue, dax to green, zup to yellow, walm might correspond to green, and wif to red. There is redundancy with dax and walm both corresponding to green; it might be that position matters, or another hidden rule affects walm's output.

Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

This reinforces that dax is green, zup is yellow, and walm is potentially context-dependent but seems to lean toward yellow, while wif remains consistent as red.

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green

This is consistent with previous examples, reinforcing zup as yellow and dax as green.

Rule: dax consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position or context within these examples. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,27,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" I'll look for patterns in the input and the corresponding output. Start by comparing examples with similar inputs to see how ""dax"" influences the output.

Example Comparisons:

1. When ""dax"" appears multiple times, such as ""dax wif dax zup bluf,"" the output is ""green red green yellow yellow."" Comparing this to ""lug dax zup dax walm wif,"" which outputs ""blue green yellow green green green red,"" we can see that both instances of ""dax"" correspond to ""green"" in the output.

2. In inputs where ""dax"" appears only once, like ""zup dax"" and ""zup dax,"" the output for ""dax"" is consistently ""green.""

3. In the example ""dax zup walm wif,"" ""dax"" precedes ""zup walm wif,"" and the output for ""dax"" is ""green.""

Based on the above analysis, it's evident that the appearance of ""dax"" consistently results in ""green"" in the output. Other words in the input do not seem to affect this outcome. Thus, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,27,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" has a consistent meaning or function in the context of sequences of nonce words and their corresponding color outputs. To deduce the rule for ""dax,"" let's analyze the examples and output:

1. In the first example, we have ""dax"" corresponding with ""green"" twice. This seems to establish a basic rule.
   Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow

2. The second example reinforces this, with ""dax"" followed by ""zup"" resulting in ""green"" followed by ""yellow.""

3. In the third example, ""dax"" continues to correspond with ""green.""

4. The fourth example is consistent as well, with ""dax"" translating to ""green.""

   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

5. The fifth example reiterates the previous findings with ""dax"" resulting in ""green.""

   ""wif"" appears before ""bluf,"" and ""bluf"" turns from green (as in example 2) to red when it is preceded by ""wif.""

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   
   ""wif"" appears before ""bluf,"" and ""bluf"" is red instead of green when it is not preceded by ""wif."" ""dax"" also turns from green to red when it appears after ""wif.""

3. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   
   ""wif"" appears before ""dax,"" and ""dax"" turns from green to red.

4. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   
   Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" and ""dax,"" and both ""walm"" and ""dax"" are red instead of their usual green.

5. Input: lug wif
   Output: blue red
   
   ""wif"" is after ""lug,"" and the output is red, which is different from the blue that ""lug"" produces, suggesting ""wif"" results in red.

Combining these observations, the rule seems to be:
When ""wif"" appears before another word, that word outputs red instead of its usual color. Red is the resultant color regardless of the usual color of the word that follows ""wif.""

Rule: wif -> Changes the following word's output color to red.",1.0,27,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red,"" and ""bluf"" by itself corresponds to ""red."" This suggests that ""wif"" does not change the color associated with ""bluf.""

- In the second example, ""wif bluf dax"" corresponds to ""red red green,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" suggesting that ""wif"" does not alter the color associated with ""dax"" either.

- In the third example, ""walm wif dax"" corresponds to ""blue blue red green."" Here, ""wif"" appears between ""walm"" and ""dax,"" and while ""walm"" alone corresponds to blue, when it is followed by ""wif,"" it shifts to red, and ""dax"" remains green.

- In the fourth example, ""wif walm dax"" corresponds to ""red red red green."" It appears that ""wif"" preceding ""walm"" again changes its associated color to red, while ""dax"" remains green.

- In the fifth example, ""lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue red."" ""Lug"" by itself corresponds to blue, and following it by ""wif"" results in ""red.""

Based on the above observations, it seems that the presence of ""wif"" before another word changes the color associated with the next word to ""red"" unless the following word is ""dax,"" in which case the color remains ""green.""

Rule: wif -> changes the color associated with the following word to red, unless that word is ""dax,"" which remains green.",1.0,27,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"", let's analyze the examples given and search for patterns.

1. In the first example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"", which could initially suggest that ""wif"" means ""red"". However, we need more information to confirm this because ""bluf"" also translates to a ""red"" output. The additional occurrence of ""dax wif"" leading to ""green red"" complicates the direct assignment since ""dax"" translates to ""green"" in all instances.

2. In the third example, ""walm wif dax"" translates to ""blue blue red green"". ""walm"" translates to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green"", but here, ""wif"" being in between translates to ""red"", not following the pattern of ""walm"" to ""blue"".

3. In the fourth example, ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green"". Both ""wif"" and ""walm"" translate to ""red"" before ""dax"" which is ""green"". This could mean ""wif"" when preceding ""walm"" becomes ""red"".

4. In the fifth example, ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red"". ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the examples, and here ""wif"" translates to ""red"", following the pattern observed when ""wif"" is not followed by ""dax"".

Reviewing all examples, a pattern emerges that the meaning of ""wif"" is context-dependent:

- When ""wif"" follows another word (and is not followed by ""dax"") it matches the color of the word it follows.
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"", it translates to ""red"".

Rule: ""wif"" -> When followed by ""dax"", ""wif"" means ""red"". Otherwise, ""wif"" takes the color of the preceding word.",0.9,27,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that wif changes meaning depending on the context, specifically, it appears to alternate between colors. Let's examine each instance of 'wif' and the associated color output in each case:

1. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   
   Here, 'wif' comes before 'bluf,' and the output is 'green red'. Considering 'bluf' outputs 'red,' 'wif' likely represents 'green' in this context.

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   
   This time 'wif' precedes 'bluf' with the outputs 'red red'. Given that 'bluf' is consistently 'red,' 'wif' could also be 'red' in this instance.

3. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   
   Here 'wif' is placed before 'dax' and the output sequence includes 'red green,' following the 'walm' to 'blue' transformation, indicating that 'wif' could be 'red' prior to 'dax'

4. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   
   'Wif' is followed by 'walm' and 'dax', with 'walm' consistently translating to 'red' in this output, suggesting that 'wif' may also correspond to 'red.'

5. Input: lug wif
   Output: blue red
   
   'Lug' translates to 'blue,' and 'wif' translates to 'red.'

When examining the patterns, it seems that 'wif' tends to precede colors and that its output color changes depending on the word that follows. From this data, it's difficult to discern a consistent rule for 'wif'. However, in most cases 'wif' is translated to 'red,' except in the first example where it precedes 'bluf' and is translated to 'green'. 

Even given the difficulty of consistency due to the limited data, it seems the most common translation for 'wif' is 'red' with one exception where it is 'green'. This exception might indicate a special rule, that 'wif' is 'green' when it precedes 'bluf'.

Rule: 'wif' typically translates to 'red,' but may vary when preceding certain words such as 'bluf' where it translates to 'green.'",0.8,27,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's inspect the correlation between the input and output for each example.

1. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

3. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   
4. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   
5. Input: lug wif
   Output: blue red

Upon examining the examples, it appears that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. For instance, ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" ""walm,"" depending on the sequence, correlates with ""yellow"" or ""blue,"" ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and ""bluf"" correlates with ""red."" 

It's notable that every time ""wif"" is present, the color sequence involves ""red,"" either as a single occurrence or repeated. However, the position of ""wif"" within the sequence affects the previous color word(s):

- When ""wif"" comes before ""bluf,"" ""red"" is repeated (Examples 1 and 2). 
- When ""wif"" comes before ""dax,"" ""red"" precedes ""green"" (Examples 3 and 4). 
- When ""wif"" comes after ""lug,"" there is only a single ""red"" (Example 5).

Given this information and the provided examples, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" signals the color ""red,"" and it sometimes causes the preceding color word to be repeated, but only if that word means ""red."" Based on this analysis:

Rule: ""wif"" means ""red"". When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" (which also means red), the ""red"" output is repeated for both words. When ""wif"" follows ""lug"" (which means blue), there is no repetition, and ""wif"" alone corresponds to ""red.""",0.8,27,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that words are translated into specific colors:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""
- ""walm"" also consistently translates to ""green"" except when following ""zup,"" where it translates to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" except when following ""zup,"" where it translates to ""yellow""
- ""zup"" does not have a consistent color output; rather, it seems to affect the word that follows it:
  - When ""zup"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output is ""yellow"" instead of the typical ""green"" associated with ""dax.""
  - When ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow"" instead of ""green.""
  - When ""zup"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""yellow"" instead of ""blue.""
  - When ""zup"" is followed by ""wif,"" there is no change, as ""wif"" output is always ""red""

Given this information, the rule for ""zup"" is that it changes the output color of the following word to ""yellow,"" except when the following word is ""wif,"" in which case ""zup"" does not have an effect on the output color. So, we can deduce:

Rule: zup -> changes the next word's associated color to yellow, except when the next word is ""wif""",1.0,27,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to analyze the input and output patterns for every instance where ""zup"" appears:

1. zup dax walm -> yellow green green green
2. wif zup -> red yellow
3. zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green green green yellow red
4. zup walm lug -> yellow yellow yellow blue
5. dax zup lug wif zup -> green yellow blue red yellow

One commonality in all outputs is that whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output has ""yellow"" at that position:

1. **zup** dax walm -> **yellow** green green green
2. wif **zup** -> red **yellow**
3. **zup** dax walm **zup** wif -> **yellow** green green green **yellow** red
4. **zup** walm lug -> **yellow** yellow yellow blue
5. dax **zup** lug wif **zup** -> green **yellow** blue red **yellow**

Here's the breakdown of the inputs and outputs that lead to this conclusion:

- Input: ""wif lug walm"" has the output: ""red blue blue blue."" Here, ""wif"" translates to ""red"", ""lug"" to a single ""blue"", and ""walm"" to repeated ""blue.""
- Input: ""wif walm"" has the output: ""red red red."" Here, ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and ""walm"" to repeated ""red.""
- Input: ""zup dax walm lug wif"" has the output: ""yellow green green green blue red."" So for ""zup dax walm"", ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""walm"" to repeated ""green.""

Given this information, ""walm"" appears to be an instruction to repeat the color word that immediately precedes it in the sequence. Specifically, if a color is mentioned right before ""walm"", that color is repeated three times in total in the output.

- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", so ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three more times (since ""blue"" has four letters).
- In the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", so ""walm"" results in ""red"" being repeated twice more (since ""red"" has three letters).
- In the third example, the pattern continues with ""lug"" (blue) before ""wif"" (red), where ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and ""blue"" is repeated three more times.
- Similar logic applies to the fourth and fifth examples with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"", where ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" and ""green"" to be repeated two and three more times respectively, following the same rule.",1.0,27,walm

It appears that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color output ""green"" regardless of its position within the input. Moreover, the presence of other words affects the colored output according to their respective positions; but ""dax"" remains associated with ""green.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

From these examples, it is clear that when ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output is ""green."" There doesn't seem to be a condition on ""dax"" that alters its meaning; it is consistent across the examples regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that surround it. Based on this pattern, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,28,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""dax"" is consistently translated to the color ""green."" To further verify the rule, notice how ""dax"" appears in different positions in the inputs but always corresponds to ""green"" in the outputs.

"Observing the patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" based on its context and the sequence of other words that appear with it.

3. Input: zup dax walm lug wif -> Output: yellow green green green blue red
4. Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue
5. Input: zup dax wif -> Output: yellow green red

Based on these examples, we can note the following:
- Whenever ""dax"" appears after ""wif"", the output is ""green"". This happens in examples 1, 2, and 5.
- Whenever ""dax"" appears before ""lug"", the output is ""green blue"". This happens in examples 2 and 4.
- ""dax"" appears by itself in example 4, which results in ""green blue"", but this is also consistent with the ""dax"" before ""lug"" observation.
- ""dax"" does not have a single consistent output pattern that is independent of the surrounding words, it seems to have a different meaning when following ""wif"" compared to when it precedes ""lug"".

Based on these observations, the rule for ""dax"" cannot be reduced to a single meaning as it depends on the context. However, a placeholder meaning could be as follows:

Rule: The meaning of ""dax"" depends on the words immediately surrounding it:
- After the word ""wif"", ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
- Before the word ""lug"", ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green blue"".

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the output color for ""wif"" is consistently ""red."" In the examples where ""wif"" is combined with other words, its output remains ""red"" before proceeding to the colors corresponding with the additional words.

Hence, the deduced meaning is: wif -> red.

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the output.",1.0,28,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to determine the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""wif"" by comparing the output colors with the input phrases.

In every example where ""wif"" is present, the output starts with ""red."" This suggests that ""wif"" is directly associated with the color ""red."" No matter what other words are present or their order, ""wif"" consistently yields ""red.""

However, there is not enough information in the examples to deduce any further rules about how ""wif"" interacts with other words or if it affects the sequence of color representation beyond its own. The only clear and consistent rule we can infer is the direct association with the color red.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,28,wif
"Based on the sequences provided, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule behind the word ""wif."" It appears initially that ""wif"" correlates to ""red."" However, in examples where there are other words following ""wif,"" the other words produce different colors.

Here are the given examples with a tentative analysis for each:

1. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

In this example, ""dax"" and ""walm"" both correspond to ""green."" ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" seems to trigger an additional ""red,"" perhaps because it follows ""wif.""

2. Input: wif
   Output: red

Here, ""wif"" on its own corresponds to ""red,"" consistent with the other examples.

3. Input: wif
   Output: red

Again, ""wif"" on its own corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue

In this example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" It suggests that ""wif"" doesn't change the color of words that follow.

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

Here, it seems that ""wif"" itself corresponds to ""red,"" as in the other examples. ""Walm"" usually corresponds to ""green"" but here is ""red,"" potentially because it directly follows ""wif."" ""Dax,"" which regularly corresponds to ""green,"" is also ""red"" here for the same reason. Finally, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Taking into account that ""wif"" consistently results in ""red,"" and the words following ""wif"" seem to change to ""red,"" except the last word, which retains its original color, we can derive a rule:

Rule: ""wif"" on its own or at the beginning of a sequence turns to ""red,"" and it also turns the following words to ""red"" until the last one, which shows its true color.

However, without more information or examples wherein ""wif"" does not precede other nonce words, we cannot fully determine if the rule derived is accurate or if there are exceptions to it. Hence, based on the given data, the tentative rule is:

wif -> red, while possibly altering the colors of subsequent words except for the last one, which retains its true color.",0.8,28,wif
"zup -> meaning. Meaning: yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence of words.",1.0,28,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,28,zup
"zup -> meaning. Meaning based on the given examples is that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,28,zup
"zup -> meaning: yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,28,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in a sequence.",1.0,28,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be dependent on the position of ""bluf"" relative to the other words and the colors those words correspond to.

When we analyze the occurrences of ""bluf"" in each example, we notice the following consistent pattern: the word right before ""bluf"" seems to dictate the first output color, which repeats once, and the word right after ""bluf"" seems to dictate the second output color, which repeats according to the number of times the color appears after ""bluf"" in the input list.

For example, in the first input: 
- The word before ""bluf"" is ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color blue, and in the output, blue appears twice.
- The word after ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red, and red appears once in the output.

In the second input:
- The word before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color yellow, and yellow appears twice in the output.
- The word after ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, and red appears three times in the output since ""walm"" (which follows ""wif"") also corresponds to red.

Given these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

bluf -> Output the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf"" twice, followed by the color corresponding to the word immediately after ""bluf,"" the number of times equal to the occurrences of that color in a row after ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf means that the word before it determines the first color to output twice, and the word after bluf determines the second color to output, repeated as many times as it sequentially appears after ""bluf"".",1.0,28,bluf
"Rule:
bluf -> The word 'bluf' represents the last color word said, repeated as many times as the numeric value associated with the following word. The numeric values are determined as follows: wif (1), zup (2), walm (3), dax (4), lug (5). For the case ""walm bluf zup,"" the color word ""red"" would be repeated twice because ""zup"" follows ""bluf"" and the numeric value for ""zup"" is 2.",1.0,28,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" seems to generate a sequence of colors that are the mix of two different colors present before and/or after ""bluf"". Specifically:

- ""lug bluf wif"" generates ""blue blue red"", which suggests that ""lug"" means ""blue"" and ""wif"" means ""red"". The word ""bluf"" generates an extra occurrence of ""blue"" (from ""lug"") and then ""red"" (from ""wif"").
  
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red"". Here, ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"", ""wif"" remains ""red"", and ""walm"" also appears to mean ""red"". The ""bluf"" leads to a repetition of ""yellow"" and then generates ""red"" corresponding to the words following it.

- ""wif bluf dax walm"" gives us ""red red green green green"". This means that ""wif"" is ""red"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""walm"" seems to be ""green"" as well. ""Bluf"" again mirrors the color preceding it (""red"") and then produces two occurrences of the colors following it (""green"" from ""dax"" and ""green"" from ""walm"").

- ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" translates to ""green green red yellow red"". Here, ""dax"" is ""green"", the ""bluf"" again repeats the green and then follows with ""red"" from ""wif"" and ""yellow"" from ""zup"". The final ""wif"" gives another ""red"".

- ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"". ""zup"" and ""walm"" are both ""yellow"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""wif"" is ""red"". ""Bluf"" here repeats the color before it (""red"") and adds an additional ""red"".

From these observations, one can induce the following rule:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:
""bluf"" translates into one repetition of the color term preceding it, followed by the color term(s) following it if there is one. If ""bluf"" is followed by multiple different color terms, it repeats just the first color term. If ""bluf"" is immediately followed by the same color term, it adds one extra instance of that same color term.",0.8,28,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"". When ""bluf"" appears in input, it seems to result in a repetition of the color immediately preceding ""bluf"" in the output, followed by a shift in the sequence to the next color for the word that follows ""bluf"".

In each case:
- ""lug bluf wif"" -> ""blue blue red"" (blue comes before ""bluf"" and is repeated, ""wif"" then means red)
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red"" (yellow comes before ""bluf"" and is repeated, ""wif"" then means red, ""walm"" also means red)
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green"" (red comes before ""bluf"" and is repeated, ""dax"" then means green, ""walm"" also means green)
- ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" -> ""green green red yellow red"" (green comes before ""bluf"" and is repeated, ""wif"" then means red, ""zup"" then means yellow, followed by another ""wif"" for red)
- ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"" (yellow appears three times before ""bluf"", ""lug"" translates to blue following ""bluf,"" finally ""wif"" means red)

From these observations, we can infer that ""bluf"" acts as a sort of duplicator for the color immediately before it and potentially shifts the color sequence thereafter.

Rule: bluf -> Replicates the previous color word in the output sequence before ""bluf"" and could also indicate a shift in the color meaning of the words that follow ""bluf"".",0.8,28,bluf
"bluf -> The word ""bluf"" means ""red"" and the number of times it is written is dependent on the number of words preceding it. Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" repeated as many times as there are unique words before it in the sequence.",0.0,28,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. Here is the reasoning:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" so ""walm"" repeats the green attributed to ""dax.""
- In the third example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" again showing that ""walm"" is repeating the color of the preceding word, ""wif"" (red).
- The fourth example further confirms this with ""lug walm zup lug walm"" translating to ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue,"" so ""walm"" takes the color of ""lug"" (blue) and repeats it until a new color word appears.
- The last example has ""lug walm"" yielding ""blue blue blue,"" consistent with the rule observed.

Therefore, ""walm"" means the repetition of the last color mentioned. To write it as requested:

Rule: walm -> a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,28,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word. 

When ""walm"" is used after a word, the color that corresponds to that word is repeated. For each occurrence of ""walm,"" we repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it.

For example, in ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" so ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" repeated. Then ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" follows with its corresponding ""blue.""

Confirmed by the examples:
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"" (repeating the color of ""dax"")
- ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red"" (repeating the color of ""wif"")
- ""lug walm zup lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"" (repeating the color of ""lug"" and then again repeating the color of ""lug"" after ""zup"")
- ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue"" (repeating the color of ""lug"")",1.0,28,walm
"Analyzing the provided examples, the following observations can be made:

1. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue""
    - ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" which translates to ""blue,"" and before ""dax"" which translates to ""green"". The output for ""walm"" in this context is ""blue.""

2. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
    - ""walm"" here follows ""dax"" which translates to ""green."" The output for ""walm"" is ""green.""

3. ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red""
    - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which translates to ""red."" The output for ""walm"" is ""red.""

4. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue""
    - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which translates to ""blue,"" and the output for ""walm"" is ""blue.""

5. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
    - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which translates to ""blue,"" and the output for ""walm"" is ""blue.""

Based on the observed patterns, the following rule can be inferred:

Rule: walm -> the same color as the color word preceding it.

This means ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that comes directly before it in the sequence. If ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" it translates to green. If it follows ""lug,"" it translates to blue, and if it follows ""wif,"" it translates to red.",1.0,28,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to affect the color output in a consistent way. It always appears to change the output to a sequence of the same color, repeating that color the number of times it appears in the sequence that follows the word ""walm"". The color it repeats is the color that was last mentioned before the word ""walm"".

- In the first example, ""lug walm dax lug,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue and after ""walm"" the output is ""blue blue green blue"", with ""blue"" repeated twice.
- In the second example, ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green and after ""walm"" we see ""green green green"", with ""green"" repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""dax wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red and after ""walm"" we see ""red red red"", with ""red"" repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm zup lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm"" we see ""blue blue,"" with ""blue"" repeated twice. Again, ""lug"" corresponds to blue and after the second ""walm,"" it outputs ""blue blue blue"", repeating ""blue"" three times. 
- In the fifth example, ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue and after ""walm"" we see ""blue blue blue"", with ""blue"" repeated three times.

So, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last mentioned color a number of times equal to the count of the unique color terms following the word ""walm"".

For example, if ""walm"" is followed by two unique color terms, the last mentioned color before ""walm"" should be repeated twice. If it's three unique color terms, the color should be repeated three times, and so forth. If ""walm"" is the last word or there are no unique color terms following it, it should not change the output.",0.8,28,walm
"Based on the examples given, it appears that ""walm"" results in the output being repeated from the previous word's color output. Here’s how the deduction works:

1. In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""blue"" instead of its usual ""green."" ""lug"" was blue before ""walm,"" so it seems like ""walm"" caused ""dax"" to repeat the color of ""lug.""

2. In the second example, ""dax"" is usually ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" it continued to repeat ""green.""

3. In the third example, ""wif"" is ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" the color ""red"" is repeated.

4. In the fourth example, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and after each ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated.

5. In the fifth example, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" the sequence continued with ""blue.""

So the rule is:
Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color output.",0.8,28,walm
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,29,lug
"Based on the input and output examples provided, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue."" Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,29,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""lug"" is directly translated to the color ""blue"" consistently in the output. It doesn't seem to change based on position or context within the list of words.

"lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in all the provided examples.",1.0,29,lug
"Based on the examples given, we can deduce the following patterns:

- Every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output.
- The appearance of ""lug"" does not seem to depend on the context of the other words; it is consistently translated to ""blue"" regardless of position or surrounding words.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,29,lug
"From the provided examples, it seems that each word in the input maps to a color in the output. The occurrences of the word ""dax"" consistently translate to the color green in the output. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,29,dax
"Based on the examples provided:

- 'zup lug zup wif dax' translates to 'yellow blue yellow red green', implying that 'dax' corresponds to 'green'.
- 'lug wif lug dax bluf' translates to 'blue red blue green green', further supporting that 'dax' means 'green'.
- 'wif lug bluf zup bluf dax' translates to 'red blue blue yellow yellow green', which continues to support that 'dax' means 'green'.
- 'dax wif' translates to 'green red', where 'dax' is 'green' and 'wif' is 'red'.
- 'dax wif bluf' translates to 'green red red', where 'dax' is 'green', 'wif' is 'red', and 'bluf' is evidently 'red' as well.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,29,dax
"Examining the examples provided, dax seems consistently correlated with the color ""green."" Its position in the sequence doesn't affect its output, indicating that its meaning is not dependent on the context within the sequence. Each instance of ""dax"" in the inputs consistently corresponds to ""green"" in the outputs.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,29,dax
"Analyzing the examples provided, it becomes clear that each nonce word ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to a specific color in the output.

Given that the color ""green"" only appears when the word ""dax"" is present in the input, and it always appears in the same position relative to the word ""dax,"" we can induce that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""

Therefore, the rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,29,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can analyze the pairs of inputs and outputs to determine the meaning of ""dax"". Let's evaluate the data:

1. When ""dax"" follows ""zup wif"" (Input: zup lug zup wif dax), the output is ""yellow blue yellow red green"". Since the strings ""zup"", ""lug"", and ""wif"" correlate to ""yellow"", ""blue"", and ""red"" respectively in the other parts of the sequence, by the process of elimination, ""dax"" should correspond to ""green"".

2. In the second example, ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"" (Input: lug wif lug dax bluf) and the output sequence ends in ""green green"". It seems that ""bluf"" consistently relates to ""green"", as well. It confirms that ""dax"" also means ""green"" because the output sequence would require a ""green"" to precede the ""green"" that corresponds to ""bluf"".

3. In the third example, ""dax"" is at the end of the sequence (Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax), and the corresponding output ends in ""green"" again.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" is at the start followed by ""wif"" (Input: dax wif). The output is ""green red"", corresponding to ""dax wif"" directly.

5. In the fifth example, it also starts with ""dax"" followed by ""wif"" and ""bluf"" (Input: dax wif bluf). The output is ""green red red"", which again matches with the given meanings of ""dax"", ""wif"", and ""bluf"".

Based on these observations, we can induce that the word ""dax"" means ""green"".

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow",1.0,29,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer a pattern for the meaning of ""zup."" It seems that ""zup"" represents a color sequence that is dependent on the number and sequence of the preceding words.

Here's how we can break down the examples:

1. ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow,"" where ""lug"" stands for ""blue"" and ""zup"" stands for ""yellow.""
2. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" translates to ""green green green red red red yellow."" Each ""walm"" represents a ""green,"" and ""wif"" represents ""red."" The sequence ends with a ""yellow,"" which suggests ""zup"" here stands for ""yellow"" again.
3. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" Here ""zup"" at the beginning is translated as triple ""yellow,"" followed by the corresponding colors for ""walm,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif.""
4. ""dax lug zup dax"" translates to ""green blue yellow green,"" where ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow"" in the sequence.
5. ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow,"" with ""wif"" being ""red"" and ""zup"" being ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and the number of times ""yellow"" is repeated is dependent on the number of words before ""zup."" If ""zup"" appears at the beginning, it will be repeated as many times as there are words following it.

Thus, we can formalize:

zup -> ""yellow"" repeated based on the number of words either before or after it in the sequence, whichever count is applicable.",0.8,29,zup
"To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze its occurrences and the corresponding outputs:

1. The sequence ""bluf lug"" corresponds with ""blue green"" and also ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue"" in different examples.
2. The sequence ""wif bluf"" corresponds with ""red red,"" suggesting ""bluf"" could mean ""red."" However, the same pair in a different example leads to ""red blue.""
3. The sequence ""zup dax bluf"" corresponds with ""yellow green green,"" and since ""zup"" and ""dax"" correspond with ""yellow"" and ""green"" respectively, the ""bluf"" here again corresponds with ""green.""
4. In the sequence ""wif bluf zup,"" where ""bluf"" is preceded and followed by different words, the output sequence is ""red red yellow,"" suggesting that in this position, ""bluf"" corresponds with ""red.""

By comparing these instances, it seems ""bluf"" does not have a fixed color assigned to it, but its meaning might be context-dependent. Specifically, it looks like ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it. To confirm:

- In examples where ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" or ""dax,"" which correspond with blue and green respectively, ""bluf"" outputs blue and green respectively.
- In examples where ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds with red, ""bluf"" outputs red.
- There is no instance of ""bluf"" following ""zup,"" so we cannot confirm how it would behave in this context.

The rule for ""bluf"" could then be:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is the same as the color word immediately before it in the sequence. If ""bluf"" follows a word that correspondences to a color, the output for ""bluf"" is that color.",0.9,29,bluf
"Analyzing the examples:

Input: zup bluf lug dax lug
Output: yellow yellow blue green blue

Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
Output: green blue yellow red red green

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue

Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
Output: yellow green green yellow green

Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
Output: red red yellow red blue green

Looking at the position of ""bluf"" and its corresponding output in each example:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is preceded and followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue.""
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and is followed by ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""red"" followed by ""green.""
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" is at the end and follows ""lug,"" which corresponds with ""blue.""
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is in the middle with ""dax"" on both sides, corresponding to ""green.""
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and is followed by ""zup,"" corresponding to ""red"" followed by ""yellow.""

It appears that ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color blue in almost all of the examples except in the second example where it has a different pattern. However, this inconsistency might be attributed to the position of ""bluf"" in the sequence (being surrounded by ""wif"" and ""dax""). Instead of this being an inconsistency, it could be that ""bluf"" actually reflects the color that comes before it in the sequence (red), not the color it signifies by itself.

Since we have an inconsistency in the data, we need to consider whether it suggests multiple rules or if there's another pattern that could reconcile the inconsistency. A potential pattern might be that ""bluf"" takes the color that precedes it in the sequence. However, this pattern is not supported by the other examples where ""bluf"" clearly maps to the color blue.

Given the inconsistency and the prevailing evidence in most of the examples, the best rule we can deduce is that ""bluf"" generally corresponds to the color blue, with a note that we have an unexplained inconsistency in one case.

Rule: bluf -> blue (with one example of inconsistent data that suggests ""bluf"" may take the color that precedes it).",0.8,29,bluf
"To identify the rule that defines the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can analyze the patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs. Here is what we can observe:

1. In the first input ""zup bluf lug dax lug,"" the output is ""yellow yellow blue green blue."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" Since ""bluf"" is surrounded by words that map to ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" and its corresponding output is ""blue,"" we can't yet conclude its meaning from this example alone.

2. In the second input ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax,"" the output is ""green blue yellow red red green."" Since ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" we see that ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" and both yield ""red"" in the output.

3. In the third input ""wif walm lug bluf,"" the output is ""red red red blue blue."" ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" while ""lug"" still maps to ""blue."" Both ""walm"" and ""bluf"" produce ""red"" and ""blue"" respectively, showing ""bluf"" provides a different color output than ""walm"" and ""wif.""

4. In the fourth input ""zup dax bluf zup dax,"" the output is ""yellow green green yellow green."" The pattern for ""zup"" (yellow) and ""dax"" (green) is consistent, and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" in this line.

5. In the fifth input ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax,"" the output is ""red red yellow red blue green."" ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""Bluf"" again yields ""red"" here, the same output as the word before it.

From these observations, we can discern a pattern for ""bluf"":

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" or ""dax,"" it yields ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (in the second and fifth examples), it yields ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" or ""walm,"" it yields ""blue.""

Thus, we might induce that ""bluf"" takes the color output of the word immediately preceding it. To phrase this as a rule:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is to replicate the color output of the word directly before it in the sequence.

So:
bluf -> meaning: Replicates the color output of the preceding word.",0.8,29,bluf
"Based on the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, it seems that ""bluf"" is associated with the color blue. In each instance where ""bluf"" is presented in the input, ""blue"" is included in the output. However, in the third example ""wif walm lug bluf,"" there are two ""bluf"" keywords resulting in two ""blue"" outputs, which suggests that there might be an additional rule or context affecting the result.

To verify if ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""blue,"" let's check the rule against each example:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" occurs once and the output is a single ""blue"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" occurs once and results in a single ""red"". However, it's noteworthy that ""red"" only appears once, which suggests that the word ""bluf"" might not directly translate to ""red"".    
- In the third example, the word ""bluf"" appears twice in a sequence and is followed by two ""blue"" in the output, reaffirming the link to ""blue"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" appears once, and the corresponding output is ""green"". However, we observe a pattern emerging where the color preceding ""bluf"" (green) repeats after it, which may suggest some rule about repetition or sequencing rather than a direct translation to ""blue"".
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue"" in the output.

With these observations in mind, it appears that in general, the word ""bluf"" correlates with the color ""blue."" However, there might be contextual rules in specific examples that alter this outcome.

Rule: bluf -> blue

With the given examples, there are inconsistencies indicating other potential underlying rules that determine the output, yet based on the dominant pattern, ""bluf"" is generally linked to the color ""blue.""",0.6,29,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color ""blue"" each time it appears. However, there is a pattern that suggests that ""bluf"" takes on a specific hue depending on the words immediately preceding or following it.

Looking at the input-output pairs:

1. Every instance of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" comes after ""lug.""
2. The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it turns red.
3. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" or ""walm,"" which both output ""red,"" then ""bluf"" turns blue.
4. If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow"") or is next to ""dax,"" it remains ""green.""

So, in essence, ""bluf"" usually means ""red,"" but there are exceptions:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it means ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" or is preceded by ""zup,"" it means ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> ""blue"" when following ""lug,"" ""green"" when following ""dax"" or preceded by ""zup,"" and ""red"" in other contexts.",0.1,29,bluf
"Upon examining the examples given, it appears that the word ""walm"" results in the word immediately preceding it being repeated three times in the output. This pattern holds true for each example provided. Therefore, ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition rule rather than translating directly to a specific color.

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color word immediately before ""walm"" three times in the output.",1.0,29,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's start by looking for patterns and commonalities in each example.

From the given examples, we can prepare a table associating the words to colors:

| Nonce Word | Color  |
|------------|--------|
| zup        | yellow |
| lug        | blue   |
| wif        | red    |
| dax        | green  |

Now let's focus on ""walm"" and its associated colors:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" is associated with the sequence ""blue red red red."" However, we have other words that precede the sequence ""walm wif walm,"" which makes it unclear which part is directly associated with ""walm.""
   
2. In the second example, ""walm"" is associated with the sequence ""yellow yellow yellow,"" following ""zup,"" which is associated with yellow. 

3. The third example has ""walm"" associated with ""red red red"" following ""wif,"" which is associated with red.

4. The fourth example includes two ""walm"" instances, and each ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of three colors that are the same: ""red red red"" after ""wif"" (red), and ""yellow yellow yellow"" after ""zup"" (yellow).

5. The fifth example has ""lug wif walm lug,"" and ""walm"" is followed by ""red red red,"" associated with ""wif"" (red), with another ""lug"" (blue) at the end.

From these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" results in three repetitions of the color that comes right before it in the sequence. So, if ""lug"" (blue) precedes ""walm,"" then ""walm"" produces ""blue blue blue."" Similarly, if ""wif"" (red) precedes ""walm,"" then ""walm"" produces ""red red red.""

Rule: walm -> The term ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be repeated three times.",1.0,29,walm
"From the given examples, it appears that 'walm' repeats the color of the word that precedes it. To deduce the rule, let's analyze the pattern as follows:

1. In example one, the first 'walm' follows 'lug' translating to 'blue' and we see 'blue blue'. The second 'walm' follows 'wif' translating to 'red' and we see 'red red red'.
2. In example two, 'walm' follows 'zup' translating into 'yellow', and then we see 'yellow yellow yellow'.
3. In example three, 'walm' follows 'wif', translating to 'red', and we see 'red red red'.
4. In example four, the first 'walm' follows 'wif', translating to 'red', and we see 'red red red'. The second 'walm' follows 'zup' translating to 'yellow', and we see 'yellow yellow yellow'.
5. In example five, 'walm' follows 'wif', translating to 'red', and we see 'red red red'.

Notice that after every 'walm', the output color is repeated three times despite the fact that 'walm' occurs only once. Also, 'walm' always repeats the color of the word right before it.

Therefore, the rule for 'walm' seems to be that it repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,29,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the relationship between the input and output sequences in detail.

1. In the first input-output pair, ""walm"" appears twice, and each time it is followed by three occurrences of the word ""blue"" in the output. This suggests that ""walm"" may mean ""blue blue blue.""

2. The second input-output sequence shows the word ""walm"" followed by three repetitions of ""yellow"" in the output. This suggests that ""walm"" may mean ""yellow yellow yellow.""

3. The third sequence similarly includes ""walm"" followed by three ""red"" in the output, which could imply that ""walm"" means ""red red red.""

4. In the fourth sequence, ""walm"" is followed by three ""yellow"" again, consistent with the notion that ""walm"" triggers a triplet of colors matching the color word preceding it.

5. The fifth sequence supports this pattern, as ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and is once again translated as three instances of ""red.""

From these observations, it seems that the word ""walm"" results in the output of the color that directly precedes it in triplet form.

Rule: walm -> ""meaning"" appears to be that 'walm' repeats the color word immediately before it three times.

Therefore: walm -> repeat the preceding color word three times.",1.0,29,walm
"Observing the patterns in each example:

1. In the first example, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and immediately following ""wif"" is ""walm"" which adds two more ""red"" and a ""blue.""
2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (""yellow"") and results in three consecutive ""yellow.""
3. In the third example, ""wif"" again translates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" results in three consecutive ""red.""
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" appears twice: once after ""wif"" (leading to three ""red"") and once after ""zup"" (leading to three ""yellow"").
5. In the fifth input, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and leads to three ""red,"" consistent with the previous examples.

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color word that precedes it, specifically leading to three occurrences of that color. If there is no color word right before ""walm,"" it defaults to repeating ""red,"" as seen in the second output string associated with ""dax zup walm"".

Rule:
walm -> repeat the preceding color word three times (if there is no color word, default to ""red"")",0.9,29,walm

"Rule: dax -> green

"By analyzing the given examples where the nonce word ""dax"" is used and the associated outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or the rule that defines ""dax.""

In each instance, when the word ""dax"" is used, the output is ""green."" This output does not change regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the words that surround it. Thus, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green,"" independent of contextual factors.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,30,dax
"Based on the given examples, we need to induce the rule that defines what ""dax"" means in the context of colors in the output. We should look for patterns where ""dax"" appears in the input and the corresponding color in the output.

Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   ""dax"" appears at the beginning and middle, both times followed by ""green.""

2. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax

Rule: In every instance where ""dax"" appears, regardless of its position or surrounding words, the output is always ""green."" Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

dax -> green",1.0,30,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that each word within the input is associated with a specific color in the output. Looking at the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can analyze the occurrences of the word ""dax"" and other words to deduce the rule for what ""dax"" means in this context:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. This happens regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence.
- The word ""dax"" does not seem to impact the colors associated with other words (e.g., ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red"", regardless of the presence of ""dax""). 

Thus, the rule appears to be that ""dax"" is directly mapped to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,30,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to look at the inputs and the outputs to identify any consistent patterns. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

1. ""zup wif lug wif"" -> ""yellow red blue red""
2. ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""
3. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""
4. ""dax bluf wif"" -> ""green green red""
5. ""lug wif lug"" -> ""blue red blue""

From these examples, we can see that every time the word ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output is ""red"". The examples also show that other nonce words (""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" ""walm"") map to different colors consistently. 

Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". Therefore:

Rule: wif -> ""red""",1.0,30,wif

- In the first example, ""wif"" appears interchanged with ""lug"" and the corresponding output colors are ""red"" and ""blue"" respectively. 
- In the second example, ""wif"" precedes ""zup"" and the output is ""red yellow"".
- The third example is particularly revealing as it contains ""wif walm dax zup"" with the output being ""red red red green yellow"". Given that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green"", it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", which remains consistent across all given examples.
- The fourth example features ""dax bluf wif"" with the output of ""green green red"", supporting the idea that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" once again.
- Lastly, the fifth example has a pattern of ""lug wif lug"" with the corresponding output of ""blue red blue"", which maintains the consistency that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"".

- ""wif zup"" results in ""red yellow."" This affirms that ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Checking the third example:
- ""wif walm dax zup"" gives ""red red red green yellow."" This suggests ""walm"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and reaffirms ""zup"" as ""yellow."" ""wif"" remains consistent as ""red.""

The fourth example:

"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following patterns for the word 'zup' and its respective output:

1. Whenever 'zup' appears, the corresponding output is 'yellow'.
2. The output 'yellow' only appears when 'zup' is present in the input.
3. 'zup' does not seem to alter the output of other words (dax, bluf, lug, walm, wif), as their outputs do not change whether or not 'zup' is present.
4. The position of 'zup' in the sequence does not affect its corresponding output, as it leads to 'yellow' regardless of where it appears in the input sequence.

- ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""
- ""dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""green green red blue""
- ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""
- ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" -> ""blue blue red blue red red red blue""
- ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" -> ""blue red red green blue blue""

Now, let's analyze:

- In the first example, ""dax wif bluf"" results in ""green red red."" Compared to the second example, ""dax bluf wif lug,"" we notice that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Since ""bluf"" appears with different outputs (""red"" in the first case and ""green"" in the second), it implies that ""bluf"" is context-dependent and not a static color.

- In the second example, ""dax bluf wif lug,"" the output ""bluf"" generates is the same as the color corresponding to ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

- In the third example, ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" here takes the color of ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" occurs twice, and each time it matches the color of the word preceding it. For example, ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue,"" and ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red.""

- The same pattern is seen in the fifth example, where ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word.

Based on the observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" changes its meaning based on the word preceding it, matching the color that the preceding word translates to. If ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" then ""bluf"" after any of these words takes on the respective color of ""green,"" ""blue,"" or ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,30,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or the rule of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the patterns in each given example. By examining the inputs and their corresponding outputs, the word ""bluf"" seems to be associated with the color red when it follows the word ""wif,"" and with the color blue when it follows the word ""lug"" or when it is preceded by ""dax."" There does not appear to be an instance of ""bluf"" standing alone or in other contexts, so we must limit our rule induction to the available examples.

Here are the observed patterns:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red.
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" or is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is blue.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" can be formulated as follows:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" it translates to red. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" or followed by ""dax,"" it translates to blue.",0.9,30,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" from the given examples, let's look at the corresponding outputs for each input:

1. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red

2. Input: dax bluf wif lug
   Output: green green red blue

3. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue

4. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

5. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
   Output: blue red red green blue blue

Based on these examples, the following observations can be made:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (example 2), the output for ""bluf"" is green.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (examples 1 and 4), the output for ""bluf"" is red.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (examples 3 and 5), the output for ""bluf"" is blue.

It appears that the meaning of ""bluf"" is dependent on the word that precedes it, and it mirrors the color associated with that preceding word:

- ""dax"" correlates with the color green.
- ""wif"" correlates with the color red.
- ""lug"" correlates with the color blue.

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the preceding word. 

Rule: bluf -> Takes on the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. If preceded by ""dax,"" it's green; if by ""wif,"" it's red; if by ""lug,"" it's blue.",0.8,30,bluf

Rule: bluf -> red,0.0,30,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the following word to have its color output repeated three times, according to a predetermined color for each word:

- ""dax"" results in green
- ""zup"" results in yellow
- ""lug"" results in blue
- ""wif"" results in red

If we turn this observation into a rule for ""walm,"" it could be stated as:

Rule: walm -> triggers the tripling of the following word's associated color.",1.0,30,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can observe a pattern between the input words and the output colors. Specifically, each time ""walm"" is used, the output includes a sequence of a specific color repeated three times. The color that follows the word ""walm"" relates to the color associated with the preceding word, as shown in the examples.

Here is the breakdown:

- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green""
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red""
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue""

It seems that ""walm"" is a function acting upon the preceding word to generate a color followed by a repeating pattern of that color three times. When the word following ""walm"" is not ""walm"" itself and is instead a different word representing a color (like ""dax"", ""wif"", or ""lug""), then the repeated color pattern is terminated by the new color pattern associated with the following word.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,30,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""walm"" indicates a transition from one color to another. Each instance of ""walm"" precedes a change in the color output pattern.

Here's a breakdown of the examples provided:

1. ""dax walm zup walm"" -> ""green green green yellow yellow yellow""
    - The color starts with green for ""dax"". After ""walm"", it changes to yellow for ""zup"". Another ""walm"" keeps the color yellow.

2. ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green""
    - The color starts with red for ""wif"". After ""walm"", it changes to green for ""dax"".

3. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" -> ""green green green yellow blue blue blue""
    - The color starts with green for ""dax"". After ""walm"", it changes to yellow for ""zup"". After ""lug"", without ""walm"", the color should change to blue, but the following ""walm"" indicates a continuation of blue.

4. ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green""
    - The color starts with blue for ""lug"". After ""walm"", it changes to green for ""dax"".

5. ""lug walm wif"" -> ""blue blue blue red""
    - The color starts with blue for ""lug"". After ""walm"", it changes to red for ""wif"".

Putting these observations together, ""walm"" seems to function as a marker for a color change that follows specific color assignments for words (e.g., ""dax"" is green, ""zup"" is yellow, ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red).

Rule: walm -> Indicates a change to the color assigned to the word that follows.",0.9,30,walm
"From analyzing the input and corresponding output, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" indicates a color switch in the sequence. The color before the ""walm"" continues for three iterations, but once ""walm"" appears, the sequence changes to a new color, and that color continues for the next three iterations until ""walm"" appears again.

Here are the observed patterns:

- Green repeats three times before ""walm"" and after ""walm"" yellow follows for three iterations, as seen in the first example.
- For ""wif walm dax,"" ""wif"" mapped to red for three iterations and after ""walm,"" ""dax"" mapped to green for one iteration (since the sequence ends there).
- A similar pattern is observed with ""lug"" mapping to blue for three iterations before ""walm"" and after ""walm"" the sequence changes to a different color.

From this pattern, ""walm"" probably indicates a function, such as ""change to the next color.""

Rule:
walm -> change to the next color. The next color repeats for three iterations or until the end of the sequence if it is shorter.",0.9,30,walm
"Observing the patterns from the given examples, we can deduce the following:

- When ""dax walm"" appears, the output is ""green green green.""
- When ""walm dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- When ""wif walm"" or ""lug walm"" appears, the output for ""walm"" is the same color as the preceding word (red for ""wif,"" blue for ""lug"").
- When ""lug"" appears by itself at the beginning, the output for ""lug"" is ""blue blue blue.""
- When ""lug walm"" immediately precedes another word, the output is ""blue blue blue,"" followed by the color associated with that word (green for ""dax,"" red for ""wif"").
- When ""walm"" is at the beginning and followed by ""zup"" or ""lug,"" it seems to convert the next word to three instances of its color (yellow for ""zup,"" blue for ""lug"").

With these observations, we can infer a rule for the word ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" modifies the color output of the following word or phrase. When preceded by another word, it takes the color of that word and produces one instance. When ""walm"" appears at the beginning or without a preceding word, it changes the following word's color output to three instances of the associated color. When followed by ""dax,"" even if preceded by other words, it outputs ""green.""

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color ""green.""

There does not seem to be any variation in this pattern, regardless of the presence or order of other words around ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,31,dax
"By analyzing the given examples and their respective outputs, we can make some observations:

- Whenever the word ""wif"" is present, the color ""red"" is part of the output.
- The word ""dax"" when combined with ""wif"" results in the output ""red green"".
- The word ""lug"" when combined with ""wif"" results in the output ""red blue"".
- In the third example, ""zup"" seems to produce ""yellow"" as output, and since ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"", and we see a repetition of ""red"" matching the number of ""wif"" instances, we can assume that ""walm"" does not change the output associated with ""wif"".
- In the fourth example, we have a sequence of ""wif"" associated words ""dax"" and ""lug"" and multiple ""wif"" appearing one after another. The ""red"" color is consistently present for each ""wif"" and the respective color that follows (green or blue) is dependent on the word that comes after ""wif"" (either ""dax"" or ""lug"").
- In the last example, the additional ""lug"" at the end reproduces the ""red blue"" output, just like when ""wif lug"" is given alone.

Considering these observations, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be that it translates to ""red"" in the output regardless of its position or the words that come after it.

"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns:

- When ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"", the output is ""red green"".
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"", the output is ""red blue"".
- When ""wif"" appears before ""walm"" (as in ""wif walm""), the output is ""red"" repeatedly for the number of letters in ""walm"" (four letters in ""walm"" result in ""red red red red"").
- When ""wif"" is followed by another ""wif"", it maintains the pattern (as in ""wif dax wif lug"", the output follows the pattern with ""red green"" for ""wif dax"" and ""red blue"" for ""wif lug"").
- When ""wif"" is at the end of the sequence, the word following ""wif"" is not present, but the output still ends with ""red"".

It is not clear what happens when ""wif"" stands alone without any word following it, but based on the last example provided, it appears that in such cases, we still output ""red"".

From the examples, it seems that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and potentially initiates a sequence determined by the word that follows ""wif"". However, without more examples or information, we can't determine a more specific rule for sequences of words following ""wif"" other than that ""dax"" leads to ""green"" and ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" after the ""red"" that ""wif"" indicates.

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and also affects the following word(s) in a sequence in an undetermined way that possibly changes based on the word that comes after ""wif"". For ""dax"", it adds ""green"" after ""red"", for ""lug"", it adds ""blue"" after ""red"", and for ""walm"", it leads to repeating ""red"" equal to the number of letters in ""walm"".

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color that was previously mentioned. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and following ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second example, the situation is identical to the first, with ""wif"" linked to ""red"" and then ""bluf"" again translating to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" it translates to ""yellow"" as well.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is ""green,"" and the following ""bluf"" matches that color with ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and the following ""bluf"" matches with ""yellow.""

From these examples, we can induce that the rule for the word ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> meaning: The color (word) that immediately precedes ""bluf"" is repeated as the output for ""bluf.""

Rule: If a color word is followed by ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" corresponds to that same color word repeated.",1.0,31,bluf

"walm -> yellow. Rule: The word ""walm"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,31,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each input and its corresponding output to identify patterns:

1. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   Immediate after ""walm"" we see a change from yellow to green.

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   The word ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""walm"" is followed by more green.

3. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   Here, after ""walm"" there is a change from blue to red.

4. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   After ""walm,"" the blue remains unchanged.

5. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
   After ""walm,"" the yellow remains unchanged and then changes to blue.

Based on these inputs and outputs, we observe that the output color after ""walm"" does not seem to be consistent; it sometimes continues the same color or changes to a different one. Let’s therefore look for a different kind of rule.

A notable pattern is the number of times the color appears after ""walm."" In each instance, the color after ""walm"" repeats itself three times:
- In the first example, ""walm dax zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow green.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by three greens.
- In the third example, ""walm wif dax"" correlates to ""blue red green,"" but ""walm"" causes the blue to appear three times in total.
- In the fourth example, ""walm lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue,"" and yellow appears three times.
- In the fifth example, ""walm lug"" correlates with ""yellow yellow blue,"" with yellow repeated three times.

From these observations, it could be inferred that ""walm"" causes the color of the word immediately following it to repeat three times in total output, changing the pattern accordingly.

Rule: walm -> The color related to the word following ""walm"" will be repeated three times in total in the output.",0.8,31,walm
"From the provided examples, ""walm"" appears to correspond with the word ""yellow."" Let's examine the pattern in the outputs every time the word ""walm"" is present:

- In the first input, ""walm"" translates to ""yellow"" in the output, and it is followed by another ""dax"" which is ""green.""
- In the second input, there is a ""dax"" before ""walm,"" and the repeated output is ""green green green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" does not change the color associated with ""dax.""
- In the third input, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and precedes ""wif"" (red), and we get the output ""blue blue blue red,"" indicating that ""walm"" assumes the value of ""blue"" before it and doesn't affect the ""red"" that comes after.
- The fourth and fifth inputs showcase ""walm"" being in the middle and at the end of the sequence, both times translating to ""yellow"" in the output.

Based on these observations, the rule is that ""walm"" takes the color of the word immediately preceding it, except when it is preceded by ""dax,"" where it instead translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the preceding word, unless preceded by ""dax,"" then it is ""yellow.""",0.8,31,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples:

1. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
3. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
4. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
5. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

Looking at the outputs corresponding to the inputs where ""walm"" is used, we see that ""walm"" results in a sequence of yellows directly after its occurrence. The number of yellows corresponds to the number of words that follow ""walm,"" up to the last word before the next color is mentioned in the output. The sequence ends with a color that corresponds to the last word before this change. For example:

- In example 1, after ""walm,"" there are two words followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow. Therefore, three yellows are outputted, followed by the next color corresponding to ""zup"".
- In example 2, ""walm"" is followed by no other words, so there are two greens outputted after ""walm,"" which corresponds to the color of ""dax"".
- In example 3, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" before the color changes due to ""dax"".
- In example 4, ""walm"" is followed by one ""lug,"" which then corresponds to blue.
- In example 5, ""walm"" is immediately followed by ""lug,"" producing two yellows before the blue corresponding to ""lug"".

Based on this pattern, it seems that ""walm"" causes the output stream to repeat the color yellow for each word following it until a new word that changes the color sequence is reached.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the output ""yellow"" for each word that follows it until a word that corresponds to a different color comes up.",0.8,31,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's inspect the correspondence between the input and output across the provided examples.

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by a ""dax"" and both lead to ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""Dax,"" when not preceded by ""walm,"" leads to ""green"" in the output, as seen in the second input.
- ""Walm"" followed by ""wif"" in the third example also results in ""blue.""
- ""Lug,"" whether it is before or after ""walm,"" leads to ""blue"" in the output.
- The output sequence always contains one more ""yellow"" after ""walm"" appears, except when ""dax"" appears immediately after.

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to initiate a sequence of ""yellow"" in the output until another defined color word (like ""dax,"" ""wif,"" or ""lug"") appears. In light of these observations:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the colors in the output to be ""yellow"" until another color word appears. If ""dax"" is the next word, it will also be ""yellow"" instead of its usual ""green"".",0.8,31,walm
"Based on the input and output examples provided, it can be deduced that the nonce word ""lug"" represents the color ""blue."" In every instance where ""lug"" appears, the corresponding output is ""blue."" Therefore, the rule can be written as follows:

"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""",1.0,32,lug

- wif lug bluf wif zup -> red blue blue red yellow
- zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
- lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> blue green green yellow blue red
- lug zup -> blue yellow

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,32,lug
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in each output sequence. It consistently corresponds to ""blue,"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence or the context it is used in.

"Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output each time it is present in the input. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green"" regardless of its position in the input string.

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns in each example.

In all instances where ""bluf"" appears, the output is a repetition of the previous color word. So ""bluf"" seems to induce repetition in the sequence that follows. Here's a breakdown:

1. Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and immediately after ""bluf,"" ""red"" is repeated.

2. Input: wif lug zup bluf -> Output: red blue yellow yellow

3. Input: wif bluf lug -> Output: red red blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and immediately after ""bluf,"" ""red"" is repeated.

4. Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and immediately after ""bluf,"" ""yellow"" is repeated.

5. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf -> Output: green red green yellow yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and immediately after ""bluf,"" ""yellow"" is repeated.

Explanation: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Since ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word immediately before it.",1.0,32,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word before it. If we examine each example:

- In `wif bluf dax`, ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and then ""bluf"" also results in ""red,"" followed by ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
- In `wif lug zup bluf`, we have ""red"" for ""wif,"" ""blue"" for ""lug,"" ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" and then ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup,"" resulting in another ""yellow.""
- In `wif bluf lug`, ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""bluf"" repeats the ""red,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""
- In `zup bluf`, ""zup"" yields ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the ""yellow.""
- In `dax wif dax zup bluf`, the sequence is ""green"" for ""dax,"" ""red"" for ""wif,"" ""green"" for the second ""dax,"" ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" and then ""bluf"" repeats the ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is that it repeats the color output of the word immediately before it.",1.0,32,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to correspond with the color that is repeated in the output. Each input before ""bluf"" correlates to a specific color in the output and when ""bluf"" is present, the color that has appeared prior to ""bluf"" in the output sequence is repeated immediately after ""bluf"".

Here is the reasoning:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and since ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red red"", ""bluf"" means repeat the previous color.

- In the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". The word ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"", and the output for ""bluf"" is a second ""yellow"".

- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"" and the output for ""bluf"" is again ""red"" which is the same as the previous color.

- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"", and the output for ""bluf"" is another ""yellow"".

- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"", and the output for ""bluf"" is again ""yellow"".

Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word mentioned in the output.",1.0,32,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the outputs whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input and establish the correlation:

2. wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow
3. wif bluf lug -> red red blue
4. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
5. dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow

Observations:
- In the first and third examples, ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" and the corresponding output is ""red red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when following ""wif.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and we see ""yellow yellow"" as the output, indicating that ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" when following ""zup.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" again and results in ""yellow yellow.""

However, in the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow yellow,"" which is consistent apart from the preceding colors unaccounted for by ""bluf.""

Based on these observations, a pattern emerges that suggests ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. If this continues to hold, ""bluf"" would not have its own inherent color but rather imitates the color associated with the preceding word. 

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color value of the preceding word.",0.8,32,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" indicates repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times. Each unique word before ""walm"" has a color associated with it, and the usage of ""walm"" after that word repeats the corresponding color three times. Here's the breakdown:

- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"": ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"": ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""lug walm"" within the third input leads to ""blue blue blue"": ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""wif walm"" within the fifth input sequence outputs ""red red red"": ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color that follows the nonsense word ""walm"". In the outputs, the color corresponding to the word immediately after ""walm"" is repeated three times. Here is the breakdown:

- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"" (dax presumably means ""green"")
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" (lug presumably means ""blue"") and when ""lug walm"" is followed by other words like ""wif lug bluf"", ""walm"" only affects the word right after it (lug -> blue) and the subsequent words are translated independently (wif -> red, bluf -> blue).

- In the first example, ""lug zup walm"" results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""walm"" causes the next word to also be yellow.
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" where ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" causes another red. There is no word after ""walm"" here, but we infer it means the same color repeats.
- In the third example, ""lug walm dax"" results in ""blue blue blue green,"" where ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" causes another blue, and then ""dax"" finally changes the color to green.

The color ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup,"" is repeated following the appearance of ""walm.""

In the second example:

The color ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif,"" is repeated following the appearance of ""walm.""

In the third example:
1. Input: lug walm dax
2. Output: blue blue blue green

The color ""blue,"" which corresponds to ""lug,"" is repeated twice following the appearance of ""walm,"" and then the sequence continues with ""dax"" which corresponds to green.

In the fourth example:
1. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
2. Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

The pattern is consistent—with ""walm"" resulting in a repetition of the color that immediately precedes it: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so three reds appear; then ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so after the second ""walm,"" we see three blues.

In the fifth example:
1. Input: dax lug walm

"Rule: The word 'walm' takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. If 'walm' is the first word, or if it is not preceded by a color word, it defaults to red.

Evidence:
- In the first example, 'walm' follows 'zup,' which has been translated to yellow, and the output for 'walm' is also yellow.
- In the second example, 'walm' is the second word with no color word before it, resulting in the output being red for both 'wif' and 'walm.'
- In the third example, 'walm' follows 'lug' (blue) and therefore, the output for 'walm' is also blue. Following which, 'dax' leads to a green output.
- In the fourth example, 'walm' follows 'wif' (red) which results in red for 'walm,' after 'dax' we see green, then following colors maintain the pattern where 'walm' matches the preceding color.

- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""lug"" to blue, which are then both repeated after ""walm"".

5. Input: dax lug walm

   ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" resulting in a repetition of ""blue.""

Based on the above examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes a repetition of the last color mentioned before it, until a new color word is introduced. Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" depends on its context, specifically the color word that precedes it.

For now, given the data provided:

- Every instance of ""dax"" results in ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output is ""green red,"" which suggests ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- The sequence ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" results in ""green yellow blue yellow yellow,"" which, assuming ""dax"" still means ""green"" and considering repetitions and changes in the sequence, indicates ""zup"" may mean ""yellow,"" ""lug"" may mean ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" could be synonymous with ""yellow,"" though one would expect ""bluf"" to mean something different due to its different spelling.
- The final example, ""dax walm wif,"" results in ""green green green red,"" indicating ""walm"" could mean ""green.""

Rule:
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow

It is important to note that we do not have any examples of ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" or ""walm"" standing alone or in different combinations without ""dax"" to confirm whether their corresponding colors remain consistent outside the presence of ""dax."" Still, within the context given, we can make the following rule:

- Each additional nonce word corresponds to a specific color:
  - ""wif"" -> ""red""

"To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs to identify a consistent pattern.

Input: wif zup

From these examples, it seems clear that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence of words.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,34,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. Here's the breakdown:

- Whenever the word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

It looks like the rule for the word ""wif"" is consistent and not dependent on context (i.e., it doesn't change with position in the input sequence or with surrounding words). 

Similarly, the words ""dax"" and ""zup"" also correspond to the same colors each time they appear, regardless of their position in the input sequence.

The word ""walm"" seems to be a repetition indicator. When it follows another nonce word, the output color is repeated that many times minus one (e.g., ""lug zup walm walm"" results in ""red blue yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""zup"" means yellow and is followed by ""walm"" twice, leading to two additional yellow outputs).

From the examples, we can infer the meaning and establish a rule for ""wif"":

wif -> red

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently maps to the color ""red."" Other words seem to map to different colors: ""dax"" to green, ""walm"" to yellow, ""lug"" to red, and ""zup"" to blue. It's important to note that ""lug"" produces a sequence of three reds in the second example, suggesting that it could mean repeating the color last mentioned, which in this case is ""red."" Similarly, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and outputs three yellows; this could indicate that ""walm"" also signals repetition of the last mentioned color, here, ""yellow.""

Given these observations, the rule for ""wif"" is:

"Based on the given examples, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. Here's the observed correspondence:

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.",1.0,34,zup

"Based on the examples given, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" represents the color that immediately follows it in the input. When ""bluf"" appears, the output color is the same as the color corresponding to the next word in the input. Let's verify this rule with the given examples:

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""bluf"" appears and is followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red.""
- The next words are ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"" and another ""wif"" corresponding to ""red.""
Output: green green red yellow red

Input: zup bluf wif
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" appears and is followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red.""
Output: yellow yellow red

Input: dax wif bluf
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""bluf"" appears and, since there are no words after it, repeats the color for ""wif"", which is ""red.""
Output: green red red

Input: zup bluf lug zup
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" appears and is followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue.""
- Another ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow

Input: wif bluf dax lug
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""bluf"" appears and is followed by ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
Output: red red green blue

Since in each case the output aligns with the explanation that ""bluf"" specifies the next color in sequence, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color corresponding to the next word in the sequence. If there is no next word, repeat the color of the word preceding ""bluf"".",1.0,34,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" correlates with the color that represents the word immediately following ""bluf."" The output color for the word immediately after ""bluf"" is always ""red,"" and each of the other words has a consistent color associated with it in all examples: 

- ""dax"" is associated with ""green""
- ""wif"" is associated with ""red""
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow""
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue""

So, regardless of the position of the word ""bluf"" in the input, it always results in the following word turning ""red"" in the output.

Rule: bluf -> changes the following word to the color ""red""",1.0,34,bluf
"Based on the examples, it appears that when the nonce word ""bluf"" is used, it signifies a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately after ""bluf"". Here is what we can deduce from each example:

1. In ""dax bluf wif zup wif"", ""dax"" is associated with green, and after ""bluf"" the color green is repeated before moving on to ""wif"" which switches the color to red. ""Zup"" is yellow and is followed by ""wif"" with red again.
2. In ""zup bluf wif"", ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the color yellow is repeated, then it changes to red for ""wif"".
3. In ""dax wif bluf"", first is green for ""dax,"" then red for ""wif,"" and red is repeated after ""bluf"" since it is the next word.
4. In ""zup bluf lug zup"", yellow is the color for ""zup,"" and it is repeated once after ""bluf."" Then, ""lug"" introduces blue, followed by a yellow ""zup"" again.
5. In ""wif bluf dax lug"", red is associated with ""wif,"" and it is repeated after ""bluf."" Next, it changes to green for ""dax,"" and blue for ""lug.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the following word before moving onwards in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Translates to the color associated with the immediately following word being repeated.",1.0,34,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine its position in relation to other words and the corresponding output colors.

Inspecting the outputs when ""bluf"" appears between two identical words:

- zup bluf zup -> yellow yellow yellow
- wif bluf wif -> red red red

We can see that when ""bluf"" is surrounded by two identical words, the output color for ""bluf"" is the same as the surrounding words.

Now let's examine the outputs when ""bluf"" is between two different words:

- dax bluf wif -> green red red
- zup bluf lug -> yellow yellow blue
- wif bluf dax -> red red green

When ""bluf"" is between two different words, the output color for ""bluf"" is not consistent with the words it is between.

From these examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word if it is the same as the following word. If the surrounding words are different, ""bluf"" results in the color ""red.""

Therefore, bluf -> the color of the word before it if the following word is the same, otherwise, ""red"".",0.9,34,bluf
"To figure out what the nonce word ""walm"" means, let's analyze the repeating patterns within the examples:

- When the input contains ""dax lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue blue blue."" The response to ""dax"" is ""green,"" and the response to ""lug"" is ""blue,"" so ""walm"" seems to repeat the last color mentioned three times.

- In the case of ""zup wif walm,"" where ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""walm"" repeats the ""red"" color three times.

- The input ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" gives us ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" but we know from the previous examples that ""lug"" is ""blue."" Since ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and we get three ""yellow"" after it, it seems to reinforce that ""walm"" repeats the last color mentioned three times.

- With the input ""wif lug walm,"" the output is ""red blue blue blue."" The first part lines up with the colors we know for ""wif"" and ""lug,"" and ""walm"" then repeats ""blue"" three times.

- Finally, in the case of ""dax walm,"" the output is ""green green green."" Since there is no color after ""dax,"" ""walm"" just repeats the ""green"" associated with ""dax"" three times.

Based on these patterns, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be repeating the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times. So, if the word before ""walm"" has an assigned color, ""walm"" will result in that color being repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" means to repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,34,walm
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the immediately preceding word three times.,1.0,34,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look at each input example and its corresponding output, focusing on patterns that emerge specifically when ""walm"" is used.

From the examples given:

1. ""dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue blue blue."" The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" ""Walm"" occurs after ""lug,"" and the output includes three repetitions of the color ""blue.""

2. ""zup wif walm"" outputs ""yellow red red red."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" When ""walm"" is used, it results in three repetitions of the color ""red"" in the output.

3. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" In this example, it's clear ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The use of ""walm"" after ""zup"" causes the output to be three additional ""yellow"" colors.

4. ""wif lug walm"" outputs ""red blue blue blue."" ""Wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and following them with ""walm"" results in three additional ""blue"" colors in the output.

5. ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green."" Here, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and there are three ""green"" colors in the output, which implies that ""walm"" is causing the previous color to be repeated thrice.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the immediate preceding color word to be repeated three times in the output. If no color precedes ""walm,"" as seen in the last example, it repeats the color corresponding to the word just before it three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color corresponding to the previous word to be outputted three more times.",1.0,34,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the repeating patterns in relation to the other given words and their corresponding outputs.

1. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
   This suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" After these colors, ""walm"" produces a repetition of the color that precedes it, so in this case, blue is repeated three times.

2. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
   Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Again, ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be repeated, which is red three times.

3. zup bluf lug zup walm -> yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   In this example, ""bluf"" seems to correspond with ""yellow"" as well, and ""lug"" is consistently ""blue."" The last word ""walm"" causes ""zup"" (yellow) to be repeated, which is consistent with the earlier observations.

4. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
   Once again, ""wif"" means ""red"" and ""lug"" means ""blue."" ""Walm"" repeats the ""blue"" three times.

5. dax walm -> green green green
   In the absence of another color between ""dax"" and ""walm,"" ""walm"" repeats the ""green"" from ""dax"" three times.

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the immediate preceding color to be repeated three times.

Therefore:

walm -> Repeat the preceding color three times.",0.9,34,walm
"To deduce the meaning of walm, let's examine the patterns of colors related to each example:

2. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
3. zup bluf lug zup walm -> yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
4. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
5. dax walm -> green green green

In each instance, the color(s) that follow 'walm' correspond to the color(s) preceding it. It seems that 'walm' might indicate a repetition of the previous color or sequence of colors. To validate this, let's break down each example:

1. dax lug walm -> 'walm' is preceded by 'dax lug' which output 'green blue' and then 'walm' repeats 'blue' three times.
2. zup wif walm -> 'walm' is preceded by 'zup wif' which output 'yellow red' and then 'walm' repeats 'red' three times.
3. zup bluf lug zup walm -> 'walm' is preceded by 'zup bluf lug zup' which output 'yellow yellow blue yellow', and then 'walm' repeats the last mentioned color 'yellow' three times.
4. wif lug walm -> 'walm' is preceded by 'wif lug' which output 'red blue' and then 'walm' repeats 'blue' three times.
5. dax walm -> 'walm' is preceded by 'dax' which outputs 'green', and then 'walm' repeats 'green' two more times for a total of three greens.

2. The position of ""zup"" in the input string does not seem to affect its corresponding output color—it is always ""yellow.""
3. No other word in the examples provided corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

"To determine what ""zup"" means, let's compare the inputs and outputs:

- When ""zup"" appears in the input, the output consistently includes the color ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" is repeated in the input sequence, the corresponding output repeats ""yellow"" for each occurrence.
- The presence of other words does not seem to affect the assignment of the color ""yellow"" to ""zup.""

5. ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red.""

Therefore, bluf -> the color corresponding to the word that precedes it.",1.0,35,bluf
"From the examples given, we can determine the following associations:

1. wif -> red
2. zup -> yellow
3. lug -> blue
4. dax -> green

When looking at how ""bluf"" is translated in each example, we notice the following:

- In examples with ""bluf"" alongside another word (e.g., ""wif zup bluf lug""), the output for ""bluf"" is the same color as the word that directly follows it.
- In examples where ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence or is only with one other word, ""bluf"" mimics the color of the word that precedes it (e.g., ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"" and ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"").

Given these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately adjacent to it; if it follows a word, then it takes the color of that word, if it precedes a word, then it takes the color of the word that follows. If ""bluf"" is positioned between two words, it takes the color of the word that comes after it (assuming there is no additional rule that specifies a preference for the word that comes before it).

So, ""bluf"" -> meaning would be that ""bluf"" means ""mimic the color of the adjacent word.""",1.0,35,bluf
"Analyzing the given examples:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug

2. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   In this example, ""bluf"" results in the same color as ""dax"" -> green.

3. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
   Output: blue green green yellow blue red
   Again, ""bluf"" takes the color of the next word, which is ""zup"" -> yellow.

4. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   The color for ""bluf"" is the same as the subsequent word, ""dax"" -> red.

5. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   In this example, ""bluf"" has the same color as the word before it, ""wif"" -> red. However, in the other examples, ""bluf"" takes the color of the word after it. There's no word after ""bluf"" in this example, so the best rule considering all examples would be that ""bluf"" mimics the color of an adjacent word. 

Based on the examples, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately following it. However, in the instance where ""bluf"" is the last word, it takes on the color of the preceding word since there is no word following it to mimic.

- ""dax walm"": ""green green green"" (three green repeated)
- ""walm"" following ""zup"" alone: ""yellow yellow yellow"" (three yellow repeated)
- ""lug walm"": ""blue blue blue"" (three blue repeated)
- ""wif walm"": ""red red red"" (three red repeated)

"To figure out what ""walm"" means, let's look at the output color sequences tied to various inputs. Given that ""walm"" appears with different preceding words in the inputs and always results in a repetition of the color preceding it, we can deduce that ""walm"" is an instruction to repeat the previous color in the sequence.

For example:
- ""zup wif dax walm lug"" produced ""yellow red green green green blue."" ""Dax"" turned into ""green,"" and then ""walm"" caused the ""green"" to be repeated twice more before ""lug"" turned into ""blue.""
- ""zup walm"" produced ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" led to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" caused this yellow to be repeated two more times.
- ""wif lug walm"" produced ""red blue blue blue."" In this case, ""lug"" resulted in ""blue,"" and ""walm"" caused ""blue"" to be repeated three times.

From these examples, we can conclude that ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the word immediately before it.

Given these observations, it seems that words in the input sequence are mapped to specific colors in the output sequence.

- Input: dax bluf wif -> Output: green green red

It's clear that when ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears as the first color in the output. Regardless of the other words that follow ""dax"" or their order, ""green"" remains consistently the first color in the output. This suggests that ""dax"" directly translates to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Observations:
1. Whenever ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" appears in the output.
2. Other nonce words each translate to a specific color.
3. ""Wif"" does not seem to affect the translation of the nonce words surrounding it. Each of them translates directly to a color regardless of the presence of ""wif"".

Therefore, it seems that ""wif"" translates directly to ""red"" with no further context-specific meaning or variation. It does not appear to be affected by position or surrounding words.

To support this induction, let's see the correlation in each input-output pair:

- Input: wif walm lug bluf -> Output: red red red blue blue
Here ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" Hence, an additional ""blue"" appears in the output.

- Input: wif zup dax bluf -> Output: red yellow green green
Here ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" Therefore, an additional ""green"" is observed in the output.

- Input: zup bluf dax -> Output: yellow yellow green
""Bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and thus ""yellow"" is repeated in the output.

- Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
Here ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which again corresponds to ""yellow,"" and we see ""yellow"" is repeated.

- Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green
""Bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and this leads to ""red"" being repeated in the output.

To summarize the rule:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" means to repeat the color indicated by the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" in the output sequence.",1.0,36,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, each word translates to a color, and it seems that the output colors are repeated based on a positional pattern:

- ""wif"" always leads to ""red""
- ""zup"" always leads to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" always leads to ""green""
- ""walm"" always leads to a repeated ""red""

Noticing the pattern that follows the word ""bluf"", it seems to repeat the color that comes immediately before it. This can be seen in the examples:

- In ""wif walm lug bluf"", ""lug"" has no color assigned presumably, but since ""walm"" leads to red and is right before ""bluf"", ""bluf"" leads to a repetition of ""red"".
- In ""wif zup dax bluf"", ""bluf"" repeats the color produced by ""dax"", which is ""green"".
- In ""zup bluf dax"", ""bluf"" repeats the color generated by ""zup"", which is ""yellow"".
- In ""zup bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and repeats its color ""yellow"".
- In ""wif bluf dax walm"", ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and repeats its color ""red"".

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it. If it is the first word, it seems to repeat the color again, as seen in the ""zup bluf"" example, indicating that if there's no preceding color, it may default to doubling the color that it itself represents. But since ""bluf"" is not the first word in all examples and seems to only follow a word with an assigned color, the rule seems consistent.",1.0,36,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word in the sequence. If the previous word is ""wif,"" repeat ""red."" If it's ""zup,"" repeat ""yellow."" If it's ""dax,"" repeat ""green."" If ""bluf"" starts the sequence or follows ""walm,"" there's no preceding word to define its color, which might lead to an undefined output, but as ""walm"" is not followed by an explicit color in any example, it cannot be reliably deduced what the output should be after ""walm."" If ""bluf"" follows itself, it repeats the color it just defined.",1.0,36,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the given examples and look for patterns that connect the input to the output. Here's a breakdown of the examples:

1. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue

2. Input: wif zup dax bluf
   Output: red yellow green green

3. Input: zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green

4. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

Analyzing the Output Patterns:
- For every occurrence of ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated once, and it seems to cause the color of the word that follows it to be repeated once as well.
- When ""bluf"" occurs at the end, there's an extra instance of the last color (e.g., ""blue"" or ""green"") repeating, except for example 1, where ""bluf"" is followed by another word, ""lug,"" but ""blue"" is repeated twice; thus, it rather seems that ""bluf"" always doubles the last color in the sequence.

Looking at the input and matching it with the output:
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" corresponds to three ""green"" for some reason in example 5, but in example 1, it corresponds to ""red""

Given the inconsistency of ""walm,"" let us focus first on the effect of ""bluf"" and ignore ""walm"" for the moment:
- ""bluf"" seems to double the color given by the word that follows it if a word does follow.
- If ""bluf"" is at the end, it doubles the last color stated.

Now let's apply this rule to see if it fits all the examples:
1. ""lug"" may be not influencing the sequence and it is ""bluf"" making the ""blue"" double.
2. ""bluf"" doubles the ""green"" that comes from ""dax.""
3. ""bluf"" doubles the ""yellow"" from itself.
4. ""bluf"" doubles the ""yellow"" from itself.
5. ""bluf"" doubles the ""green"" that comes from ""dax.""

Given this investigation, we can now build our rule. However, ""walm"" still remains inconsistent. If we ignore the instance where it corresponds to three repetitions of ""green,"" and assume it corresponds to a single ""red,"" we could suggest the following:

Rule:
bluf -> follows the color given by the next word if there is one and doubles it; if ""bluf"" is at the end, it doubles the last color that was given. It also seems that ""bluf"" by itself generates a ""yellow"" irrespective of whether another word follows it or not.",0.8,36,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" is added to the output for each occurrence. Additionally, it seems that the word ""bluf"" also causes the previous word in the input to repeat its corresponding color in the output. Here is how the word ""bluf"" behaves in each example:

1. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red (for wif) red (for walm) red (repeated for walm because of bluf) blue (for lug) blue (for bluf)
   The presence of ""bluf"" causes ""walm"" to repeat its color ""red,"" and ""bluf"" itself is assigned the color ""blue.""

2. Input: wif zup dax bluf
   Output: red (for wif) yellow (for zup) green (for dax) green (for bluf)
   In this instance, ""bluf"" takes the color of the precedent word ""dax"" which is green.

3. Input: zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow (for zup) yellow (for bluf) green (for dax)
   Here, ""bluf"" repeats the color yellow for ""zup.""

4. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow (for zup) yellow (for bluf)
   ""Bluf"" again repeats the color yellow from ""zup.""

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red (for wif) red (for bluf) green (for dax) green (for walm)
   In this case, ""bluf"" repeats the color red from ""wif.""

Based on the observation, ""bluf"" causes the previous color to repeat, but also tends to have its own color. However, the examples are inconsistent with the color it takes on (for example, in (1) blue is for bluf, while in (2) and (3) green and yellow are assigned to bluf respectively). This inconsistency precludes a definite color assignment for bluf without further examples or rules.

With this in mind, we can't confidently assign a definitive meaning to ""bluf"" in terms of a color, but it does demonstrate a pattern of repetition for the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule:
bluf -> Repeats the color of the preceding word in the output. The color that ""bluf"" itself represents requires additional context or examples for a clear rule to be determined.",0.0,36,bluf
"Rule: The word ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. 

Evidence for this includes the fact that every time the word ""walm"" follows another, the color associated with that preceding word is repeated thrice in the output. 

For example:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Therefore:

walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,36,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in its use across the different examples, noting the output colors associated with it.

In the first example, ""walm"" appears twice and is followed once by ""wif"" and once by ""zup"". The corresponding output colors are ""green green green red red red yellow,"" with the triple appearance of colors associated with its position before ""wif"" and ""zup"".

In the second example, ""walm"" appears once, preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""lug"", with the output colors being ""green green green"" (associated with ""dax""), and blue for ""lug"".

In the third example, it's just ""dax walm"" with output ""green green green,"" again associating the triple color occurrence with the presence of ""dax"" before ""walm"".

In the fourth example, ""zup walm lug"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" associating the triple-yellow color with ""zup"" before ""walm"" and blue with ""lug"".

In the last example, ""wif walm dax"" shows an output of ""red red red green"", associating ""wif"" before ""walm"" with triple-red color and green for ""dax"".

From this, we can deduce the following pattern: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to appear three times in a row in the output. If ""walm"" is the last word with no following word, no additional color is added.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the word directly before ""walm"" three times in the output.",0.9,36,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns of the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

- dax walm wif walm zup leads to green green green red red red yellow.
- zup dax walm lug wif leads to yellow green green green blue red.
- dax walm leads to green green green.
- zup walm lug leads to yellow yellow yellow blue.
- wif walm dax leads to red red red green.

The word ""walm"" in each sequence seems to repeat the color associated with the word directly preceding it in the input sequence. The number of repetitions for ""walm"" seems to be three in each case:

- ""dax walm"" -> green green green.
- ""zup walm"" -> yellow yellow yellow.
- ""wif walm"" -> red red red.

However, when ""walm"" follows another occurrence of ""walm,"" there are no instances to draw a direct inference from, but we can infer that the rule continues to apply since the output color continues without interruption.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be described as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" makes the following word in the sequence repeat the color assigned to the preceding word three times if it is the first occurrence. If ""walm"" follows another ""walm,"" the repetition seems to continue uninterrupted.

So, the meaning of ""walm"" is:

walm -> Triggers a repetition of the color associated with the previous word in the output sequence, indicated three times. If it is a subsequent occurrence of ""walm,"" the same color repetition continues.",0.9,36,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the common pattern in each example provided:

- Whenever ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green repeated three times.
- Whenever ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is yellow repeated two times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red repeated two times.
- The output seems to be a repetition of the same color, and the number of repetitions is consistent within each example paired with the same word before ""walm.""

Based on these observations, we could infer that ""walm"" means to repeat the output color associated with the previous word a specific number of times. The number of repetitions seems to be dictated by the word that comes before ""walm."" For example, ""dax walm"" always results in three greens, while ""zup walm"" results in two yellows, and ""wif walm"" results in two reds.

Thus, the rule could be defined as:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color of the previous word's output a specific number of times. The number of repetitions is determined by the specific word that precedes ""walm"" in the sequence (e.g., ""dax"" leads to three repetitions, ""zup"" leads to two repetitions, ""wif"" leads to two repetitions, and ""lug"" leads to one repetition).",0.9,36,walm
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to have a function in determining the color output of the following word in the sequence. The rule appears to relate to repetition of the color associated with the subsequent word.

Looking at the given inputs and their corresponding outputs, we see:

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"". Here are the instances that demonstrate this:

- ""lug wif dax"" translates to ""blue red green"". ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""; thus ""dax"" must represent ""green"".
- ""dax zup"" translates to ""green yellow"". Since ""zup"" comes after ""dax"" and corresponds to ""yellow"", it is clear that ""dax"" means ""green"".
- ""wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""red blue green green green"". ""Wif"" translates to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and since ""walm"" doesn't appear in previous examples but is repeated as ""green"" three times following ""dax"", it suggests that both ""dax"" and ""walm"" mean ""green"".
- ""zup bluf dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow green"". ""Zup"" is repeated as ""yellow"", and since ""bluf"" is a new term but repeats the ""yellow"" color, it is probably another word for ""yellow"". Thus, ""dax"" is left to mean ""green"".
- ""zup dax walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green blue red"". Here ""zup"", ""lug"", and ""wif"" retain their earlier meanings. The word ""dax"" is followed by ""green"", and ""walm"" is still translated as ""green"" multiple times. Hence, ""dax"" signifies ""green"".

2. Input: dax zup

5. Input: zup dax walm lug wif  
   Output: yellow green green green blue red  
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""walm"" to ""green green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

Considering all the examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,37,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"". Below is the breakdown of the rule deduction process using the examples:

1. ""lug wif dax"" -> ""blue red green""
   - Since ""lug"" becomes ""blue"" and ""wif"" becomes ""red"", it follows that ""dax"" becomes ""green"".

2. ""dax zup"" -> ""green yellow""
   - ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" is the only word left, so it must translate to ""green"".

3. ""wif lug dax walm"" -> ""red blue green green green""
   - ""Wif"" is ""red"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""walm"" seems to be ""green green"". Therefore, ""dax"" is ""green"".

4. ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""
   - ""Zup"" is again ""yellow"" and with ""bluf"" also turning into ""yellow"", by elimination ""dax"" translates to ""green"".

5. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" -> ""yellow green green green blue red""
   - ""Zup"" is ""yellow"", ""walm"" is followed by ""green green"", ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""wif"" is ""red"". This leaves ""dax"" to be ""green"".

Considering these examples, the rule is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",0.8,37,dax
"Based on the input and output provided, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a color as follows:

- wif -> red
- bluf -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue (single instance)
- walm -> blue (repeated for emphasis or quantity)

Given this pattern, the meaning of ""wif"" can be consistently inferred as ""red."" Therefore, the rule is:

"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position or the context in which it is used.",1.0,37,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Each occurrence of ""wif"" results in the color red being given as the output.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,37,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" is consistently translated to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the output contains the word ""red."" Therefore:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,37,wif
"wif -> meaning. Based on the given examples, where the input ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red,"" the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" can be deduced to correspond to the color red.

Rule: wif = red",1.0,37,wif
"Based on the given examples:

- When ""zup"" appears alone, the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output adds ""blue.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output adds ""red.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output adds ""green.""
- The word that follows ""zup"" changes the color that is added to the output.
- Repeated non-""zup"" words carry their same output (as seen with ""wif"" leading to ""red"" repeatedly).

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" and it can precede other words that correspond to different colors, which are added to the output in the order they appear.

Rule: ""zup"" -> ""yellow""",1.0,37,zup
"The examples you've provided indicate a consistent mapping between the nonce word ""zup"" and the color ""yellow."" When ""zup"" appears alone, the output is simply ""yellow."" When it appears with other words, those words correspond to different colors. Here is how the mapping looks based on the examples:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""bluf"" also seems to correspond to ""red""

The rule in this case is that ""zup"" represents the color ""yellow,"" while other words following it are translated into colors that they represent.

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> blue",0.0,37,bluf

- The third example again shows ""bluf"" corresponding to ""red"".
- The fourth example is a repetition of the second example, still maintaining ""bluf"" as ""yellow"".
- The fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"".

Looking at the patterns of the remaining words and their consistent outputs, you can induce that ""wif"" correlates to ""red"", ""lug"" correlates to ""blue"", and ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow"".

Given the information, it seems that ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""blue"".

Rule: bluf -> blue.",0.0,37,bluf

"bluf -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.",0.0,37,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to lead to the output ""blue"" repeated a number of times corresponding to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Let's analyze the examples:

Input: dax lug walm                 Output: green blue blue blue
Input: lug walm dax                 Output: blue blue blue green
Input: lug zup walm lug             Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
Input: dax walm zup lug dax         Output: green green green yellow blue green
Input: zup lug walm wif dax         Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

In the first example, ""walm"" appears third and results in ""blue"" being repeated three times. In the second example, ""walm"" is second, so ""blue"" is repeated twice. Continuing this pattern through the rest of the examples, it seems that ""walm"" dictates the repetition of ""blue"" based on its position in the input list.

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" is replaced by the word ""blue"" repeated as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the input list.",1.0,37,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" appears to mean ""repeat the color of the previous word"" in the sequence.

Explanation: Looking at every instance where the word ""walm"" is used, the output color is a repetition of the color that is associated with the word just before it.

- In ""dax lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and following ""walm"", the output is blue repeated.
- In ""lug walm dax"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue again, and ""walm"" is followed by blue before the sequence changes to green for ""dax"".
- In ""lug zup walm lug"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. Following ""walm"", the output repeats yellow. ""lug"" then corresponds to blue again.
- In ""dax walm zup lug dax"", the color green for ""dax"" is repeated after ""walm"" before changing to yellow for ""zup"".
- In ""zup lug walm wif dax"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue before ""walm"", and after ""walm"", blue is repeated before changing to red for ""wif"".

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word.",1.0,37,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Whenever ""walm"" is used, it takes the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Let's examine the examples to deduce this rule:

In the first example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and ""lug"" correlates to blue. The output for ""walm"" is blue, repeated four times.

In the second example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" again, and the output for ""walm"" is blue, repeated three times before it changes to green for ""dax.""

In the third example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""zup"" correlates to yellow. The output for ""walm"" is yellow twice, followed by the color for ""lug,"" which is blue, repeated once.

In the fourth example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""dax"" correlates to green. The output for ""walm"" is green three times before it changes to yellow for ""zup"", to blue for ""lug,"" and back to green for another ""dax.""

In the fifth example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""lug"" correlates to blue. The output for ""walm"" is blue three times before it changes to red for ""wif"" and green for ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,37,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" directly influences the color mentioned after it, changing its result to ""blue"" regardless of the usual color associated with that word. We can observe the pattern that any word following ""walm"" is translated to ""blue,"" while the other words retain their consistent color associations: ""dax"" with ""green,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" with ""red.""

For instance, looking at the first example: 
- ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue,"" where ""walm"" causes the word after it, which would otherwise be ""green"" for ""dax,"" to become ""blue.""

Another example is the second input:
- ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green,"" where ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""walm"" causes the next word (""dax"") to turn ""blue"" instead of its usual ""green,"" and then ""dax"" at the end retains its ""green"" color as there is no ""walm"" before it.

Rule: walm -> causes the following word's usual color code to change to ""blue"".",1.0,37,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can observe the following patterns related to the output colors corresponding to other words:

- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"".
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""wif"" is only present in one example, but it corresponds to ""red"".

Now, let's look at the outputs where ""walm"" is present:

- ""dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue"". Since ""dax"" is green and ""lug"" is blue, the repetition of blue suggests that ""walm"" also corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""lug walm dax"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue green"". Here again, ""lug"" translates into blue, ""dax"" into green, and the repetition of blue suggests ""walm"" is blue.
- ""lug zup walm lug"" corresponds to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". ""lug"" correlates to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, and with ""lug"" repeating at the end and having blue in the start and end, it seems that ""walm"" means ""yellow"", but that contradicts the previous findings.
- ""dax walm zup lug dax"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow blue green"". ""zup"" aligns with yellow and ""lug"" with blue again, while ""dax"" bookends the sequence with green. The presence of ""walm"" adjacent to ""dax"" and their corresponding colors suggest ""walm"" is ""green"" here, conflicting with earlier observations.
- ""zup lug walm wif dax"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue red green"". Here, we have ""zup"" as yellow, ""lug"" as blue, ""wif"" as red, and ""dax"" as green. The occurrence of ""walm"" before ""wif"" and ""dax"" corresponds to blue, which is consistent with the first and second observations but not with the third and fourth.

The initial patterns suggest that ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"". However, the third and fourth examples introduce a conflict in this interpretation. To reconcile these conflicts, it might be needed to consider ""walm"" as having a more complex meaning that could depend on the context (words around it). Given the contradiction, we cannot provide a definitive single color or rule for ""walm"" just from these examples. 

Nonetheless, if we abstract from the specific conflicting instances and look for the most frequent case, then it seems that ""walm"" often corresponds to ""blue"". However, further information or more examples would be needed to define a clear rule for ""walm"".

From the majority of the provided evidence, the best interim rule we can suggest is:

2. wif walm zup lug wif walm zup -> red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
3. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green
4. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
5. zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red

From these examples, it seems ""walm"" is always followed by the output colour blue, with one instance of it being blue blue (indicating a repetition of the blue output). Furthermore, when ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" it increases the frequency of the blue output immediately after ""walm."" However, the word before ""lug"" then dictates the color before the blue output.

Additionally, ""walm"" seems to have its output extend the preceding color when it appears without ""lug"" in front of it (as in the second example). 

Let's formulate the rules based on these observations:

- ""walm"" by itself causes the preceding color to repeat.
- When preceded directly by ""lug,"" this effect is enhanced, causing the word ""blue"" to be repeated (in output) twice immediately after ""walm"".

From these two rules, we can say:

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that wif corresponds to a specific color each time it is mentioned. Across all examples, whenever the word wif appears in the input, the word red appears in the same position in the output. There is no variation in this pattern, suggesting that wif is directly associated with the color red, regardless of its position or the context given by surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,39,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red.""

Here is the deduced rule:

"From the examples provided, we can observe a pattern that assigns colors to given nonce words. We see that each occurrence of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Regardless of the position in the input sequence or the words that precede or follow it, ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red"". With these observations, we can deduce the following:

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".",1.0,39,wif
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples provided, every time the word ""zup"" appears, it corresponds to the color yellow in the output. Here's the breakdown:

- ""wif dax zup wif"" translates to ""red green yellow red"", with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"".
- ""wif dax zup dax"" translates to ""red green yellow green"", with ""zup"" again corresponding to ""yellow"".
- ""wif walm dax zup"", translates to ""red red red green yellow"" - the only novel element towards the end is ""zup"", which gives us ""yellow"".
- ""dax zup lug wif lug"" translates to ""green yellow blue red blue"", with ""zup"" corresponding to the second color ""yellow"".
- ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow"", with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"".

This consistent one-to-one correspondence allows us to induce that the meaning of ""zup"" in this context is the color ""yellow"".",1.0,39,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow"". Each time the word ""zup"" is used in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. 

Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,39,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. The rule for the word ""zup"" can be inferred by looking at the position of ""zup"" in the input and the corresponding position in the output.

Let's examine the provided examples to deduce the rule for ""zup"":

- In the first example, ""zup"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif,"" and the output colors are green and red with ""yellow"" in between.
- In the second example, ""zup"" is between ""dax"" and ""dax,"" and both are translated to ""green"" with ""yellow"" in between.
- In the third example, ""zup"" follows three ""red"" and is followed by ""green,"" while also being translated to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" is followed by ""lug"" and the output colors are yellow and blue.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" follows ""wif"" and the output is red followed by yellow.

Considering all examples, it can be observed that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the output color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position or the words around it.

So, the rule is:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Each input word is assigned a specific color in the output, and the word ""zup"" always corresponds to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,39,zup
"Rule: zup translates to ""yellow.""",1.0,39,zup
"Given the examples, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to a particular color as output in the sequence. We can identify this by the consistent appearance of ""yellow"" in the output every time ""zup"" appears in the input. 

In every instance, irrespective of the surrounding words (""wif"", ""dax"", ""walm"", ""lug""), the word ""zup"" always results in the word ""yellow"". The other words correlate with other colors consistently (""wif"" with ""red"", ""dax"" with ""green"", ""lug"" with ""blue"", and ""walm"" appears to be an additional ""red""), reinforcing that ""zup"" correlates specifically to the color ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,39,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color output that repeats the color output of the word immediately preceding it. Here's the analysis:
- In the first input, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" is followed by another ""red"".
- In the second input, ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red"" and is followed by ""bluf"" outputting another ""red"".
- In the third input, ""wif"" is ""red"" and is followed by ""bluf"", which is again ""red"".
- In the fourth input, ""wif"" alone followed by ""bluf"" yields two ""reds"" back-to-back with no other color in between.
- In the fifth input, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by ""bluf"" which is also ""yellow"".

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" inherits the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Here is the analysis of each example:

1. Input: ""wif walm dax zup""
   Output: ""red red red green yellow""
   ""wif"" is translated to ""red,"" and ""walm"" that follows it is also ""red.""

2. Input: ""zup lug walm""

4. Input: ""zup walm dax lug""

   ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" that follows it is also ""yellow.""

5. Input: ""dax zup dax walm""
   Output: ""green yellow green green green""
   ""dax"" is translated to ""green,"" and ""walm"" that follows it is also ""green.""

Rule: walm -> inherits the color of the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,39,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the color outputs in correlation with the input words.

Looking at the examples:

1. **wif walm dax zup**
   - Output: red red red green yellow
   - Analysis: ""wif"" results in red and so does ""walm"" in this context, suggesting they share a trait. ""dax"" yields green and ""zup"" yellow.

2. **zup lug walm**
   - Output: yellow blue blue blue
   - Analysis: ""zup"" again yields yellow, ""lug"" blue, and ""walm"" is once again output as blue, matching the color of ""lug.""

3. **lug walm wif lug bluf**
   - Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   - Analysis: ""lug"" is associated with blue, ""walm"" then also blue, ""wif"" with red, and ""lug"" again with blue. ""bluf"" hasn't appeared in prior examples but output as blue.

4. **zup walm dax lug**
   - Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   - Analysis: ""zup"" correlates with yellow and as ""walm"" follows, it takes on the same color yellow. ""dax"" correlates with green and ""lug"" again with blue.

5. **dax zup dax walm**
   - Output: green yellow green green green
   - Analysis: ""dax"" is consistent with green, ""zup"" with yellow, and now ""walm"" corresponds to green immediately after ""dax.""

From these examples, ""walm"" seems to take on the color of the word that directly precedes it:

- In example 1, ""wif"" is associated with red, and when ""walm"" follows it also becomes red.
- In example 2, ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" follows as blue.
- In example 3, ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" follows as blue. 
- In example 4, ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and ""walm"" becomes yellow when it follows.
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which is green, and it too becomes green.

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word.",1.0,39,walm
"Given the examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" is associated with color outputs that match the color output of the word that precedes it:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" Hence, ""walm"" outputs ""red.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" Hence, ""walm"" outputs ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" Hence, ""walm"" outputs ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" Hence, ""walm"" outputs ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" Hence, ""walm"" outputs ""green.""

Thus, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be that it takes on the color value of the preceding word in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> The color output of the preceding word.",1.0,39,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at patterns and correlations between the use of the word ""walm"" and the corresponding colors in the outputs.

Analyzing the given examples:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and both are marked red.

2. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output for both is blue.

3. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which has an output color of blue. Thus, ""walm"" is also blue.

4. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" with the output color yellow.

5. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output for both is green.

From these examples, we can deduce that the color output for ""walm"" is the same as the color output for the word that precedes it. ""Walm"" seems to effectively act as a placeholder, taking the color of the preceding word's assigned output color.

Rule: walm -> takes the output color of the word preceding it.",1.0,39,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to act as a color modifier rather than a standalone noun with a fixed meaning. It appears to change the color associated with the following word to match the color of the preceding word. Here's how the rule appears to apply in the examples:

1. Input: wif **walm** dax zup 
   Output: red **red** red green yellow
2. Input: zup lug **walm**
   Output: yellow blue **blue** blue
3. Input: lug **walm** wif lug bluf
   Output: blue **blue** blue red blue blue
4. Input: zup **walm** dax lug
   Output: yellow **yellow** yellow green blue
5. Input: dax zup dax **walm**
   Output: green yellow green **green** green

From these examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" takes the color of the word preceding it and applies that color to the subsequent word in the sequence. If ""walm"" follows a word that outputs a specific color, it causes the next word to output the same color, essentially duplicating the color output of the previous word.

Stated simply: walm -> The following word takes the color of the word before ""walm"".",0.8,39,walm

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,40,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" However, let's take a closer look at each example to confirm this:

- In the first input, ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf,"" we have the corresponding output ""blue red red green blue blue."" The word ""dax"" directly corresponds to ""green"" in this sequence.

- In the second input, ""dax lug,"" the output is ""green blue."" Here again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

- In the third input, which is simply ""dax,"" we have the output ""green."" This direct association further confirms the meaning.

- In the fourth input, ""wif dax bluf,"" the output is ""red green green,"" once again showing ""dax"" as ""green.""

- Finally, in the fifth input, ""dax lug dax lug wif,"" the output is ""green blue green blue red."" The two instances of ""dax"" both correspond to ""green.""

From these examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,40,dax
Rule: dax -> green.,1.0,40,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- In the first example, when ""dax"" is between ""bluf"" and ""lug,"" it maps to ""green.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" followed by ""lug"" also results in ""green blue.""
- The third example is just ""dax,"" which results in ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""bluf,"" yet both instances of ""dax"" map to ""green.""
- The fifth example shows ""dax"" alternating with ""lug"" and ends on ""wif,"" with all occurrences of ""dax"" still mapping to ""green.""

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input.",1.0,40,zup
"To figure out what ""zup"" means, we must look for patterns in the examples provided. Let's focus on the position of ""zup"" and the corresponding color in the output.

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"". ""Bluf"" must mean ""yellow"", and since ""zup"" also results in ""yellow"", it appears that ""zup"" might mean ""yellow"" too.
- In the second example, ""zup bluf dax"" results in ""yellow yellow green"". We know ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" from the first example, and ""dax"" likely means ""green"" given its output. ""Zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow"" here.
- In the third example, ""dax zup"" results in ""green yellow"", so ""zup"" following ""dax"" still means ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""Walm"" isn't in the other examples, but given that ""zup"" has consistently meant ""yellow"", it's likely ""walm"" means ""yellow"" as well.
- In the fifth example, ""lug dax zup dax wif"" results in ""blue green yellow green red"". We can deduce that ""lug"" likely means ""blue"", ""dax"" means ""green"" (from previous examples), and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". ""Zup"" is again translating to ""yellow"" here.

Given that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" in every place it appears, we can determine:

Rule: zup means yellow.",1.0,40,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word zup translates to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the list of nonce words.",1.0,40,zup
"bluf -> meaning. Looking at the outputs corresponding to inputs where 'bluf' is present, we can observe the following pattern:

1. In examples where 'bluf' follows 'dax', the output for 'bluf' is 'green'.

3. In examples where 'bluf' follows 'lug', the output for 'bluf' is 'blue'.

Therefore, the meaning of 'bluf' is dependent on the context, specifically the word that precedes it. Rule:

- 'bluf' means 'red' after 'wif' or 'zup'.",1.0,40,bluf

"bluf -> meaning. The meanings of the word ""bluf"" can be deduced as follows:

Given the pattern of the inputs and the corresponding outputs, ""dax"" always translates to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""walm"" to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

Breaking down the examples:

1. ""dax lug bluf"" translates to ""green blue blue"". Here, ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""lug"" is ""blue"". The only word left is ""bluf"" which also translates to ""blue"". 

2. ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue blue blue green red red green"". The sequence ""dax lug walm"" aligns with ""green blue blue"". Hence, ""walm"" is another word for ""blue"", similar to ""lug"". This is repeated before ""dax wif"" aligns with ""green red"". The word ""bluf"" appears once more and translates to ""red"", just like ""wif"" did.

3. ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow green yellow green red red"". In this example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and translates to ""red"" just like ""wif"".

4. ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"". ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and there is a single ""bluf"" which also translates to ""green"".

5. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""green red yellow yellow red red red"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow"" and also translates to ""yellow"".

Based on these inputs and outputs, ""bluf"" seems to take the color of the word that precedes it:

- When ""lug"" or ""walm"" (both translating to ""blue"") precede ""bluf"", it is ""blue"".
- When ""wif"" (translating to ""red"") precedes ""bluf"", it is ""red"".
- When ""zup"" (translating to ""yellow"") precedes ""bluf"", it is ""yellow"".
- When ""dax"" (translating to ""green"") precedes ""bluf"", it is ""green"".

If ""bluf"" is at the start or followed by a word whose color meaning is not established, then ""bluf"" translates to the color of the word that immediately follows it. However, without an established word following ""bluf"" for reference, we would not be able to determine its color from these examples alone.

"Analyzing the examples provided, we can identify a pattern related to the word ""walm."" The examples show:

1. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
   - After ""walm wif"" the colors alternate starting with ""red.""

2. ""dax walm wif dax"" translates to ""green green green red green""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
   - Again, after ""walm wif"" the color sequence includes ""red.""

3. ""lug dax walm wif"" translates to ""blue green green green red""
   - ""lug"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""blue"" and ""green,"" respectively.
   - ""wif"" does not have a direct color translation, but the presence of ""walm wif"" results in a ""red.""

4. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"" in the output.
   - After the first ""walm wif,"" there's a ""red,"" and subsequent ""walm"" continues the ""red"" color.

5. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - When ""walm"" appears without ""wif"" following it, there's no ""red"" color in the sequence, and the color ""green"" is repeated.

From these examples, we deduce that ""walm"" has the following rules based on its position and context:

- When followed by ""wif,"" it causes a change in the sequence, introducing ""red"" after the repetition of the color that came before it.
- When not followed by ""wif,"" it causes repetition of the previous color.

Rule: ""walm"" -> when followed by ""wif"" introduces ""red"" after the repetition of the previous color; when not followed by ""wif,"" it causes repetition of the previous color.",0.9,40,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a series of the same colored words followed by the word ""red."" Moreover, the color of the repeated words preceding ""red"" after ""walm"" seems to be dependent on the color word that precedes ""walm."" To summarize:

- ""lug walm"" produces a series of ""blue"" followed by ""red.""
- ""dax walm"" produces a series of ""green"" followed by ""red.""
- In the third example, ""lug dax walm"" still produces a series of ""green"" right after the ""walm,"" which suggests that the last color word mentioned before ""walm"" determines the color of the series.
- When the word ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" there is only one occurrence of ""red,"" which shows that the number of repetitions of the color might be one less than otherwise.
- In the absence of ""wif,"" in the final example, ""dax walm"" leads to repetitions of the color green thrice, indicating that ""walm"" without a following word results in three repetitions of the preceding color plus an additional ""red.""

Therefore, we can deduce the rule:

walm -> Repeat the most recent color mentioned three times followed by the color ""red."" If the word ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" repeat the preceding color two times instead of three before concluding with ""red.""",0.8,40,walm
"From the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

- The appearance of the word ""walm"" seems to be related to a series of colors, specifically a repetition of the color before it, followed by the color red.

Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
- ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" resulting in ""blue blue blue red."" 

2. Input: dax walm wif dax -> Output: green green green red green
- ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" resulting in ""green green green red.""

3. Input: lug dax walm wif -> Output: blue green green green red
- ""walm"" appears after ""lug dax,"" with the color immediately preceding ""walm"" being ""green,"" resulting in ""green green green red.""

4. Input: zup lug walm wif walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
- The first ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" corresponding to ""blue,"" resulting in ""blue blue blue red.""
- The second ""walm"" follows the whole sequence including the first occurrence of ""walm,"" which ended with ""red,"" resulting in ""red red red.""

5. Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
- ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" resulting in ""green green green."" There is no red here, which indicates that the sequence that includes ""walm"" must be followed by something else for red to appear.

Rule:
- ""walm"" -> It repeats the color corresponding to the word before it three times followed by the color red, provided that there is another word after ""walm."" If ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, only the color that corresponds to the previous word is repeated three times without the color red.

In the case of point 5, ""walm"" does not include red as it is the last word in the sequence. Therefore, the rule is contingent on the placement of ""walm"" within the sequence.",0.8,40,walm
"Based on the provided examples, ""lug"" appears to be a nonce word that is linked to a corresponding color output. In all cases where ""lug"" appears, the color ""blue"" is part of the output sequence. Observing the input and corresponding output sequences, ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, we can deduce the following:

Rule: lug -> ""blue""",1.0,41,lug
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,41,lug
"By comparing the input and output strings from the examples provided, we can deduce that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. Let's analyze the occurrences of ""lug"" and its corresponding output:

1. In the first example, ""dax lug"" translates to ""green blue"". Since ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" in other examples, we can deduce that ""lug"" corresponds to blue here.

2. In the second example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" translates to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"". We can see ""dax"" again translating to ""green"". ""Wif"" and ""walm"" seem to correspond to ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively (based on other examples), and ""zup"" seems to be ""yellow"" as well. So, ""lug"" can be inferred as ""blue"" here as well.

3. ""dax lug bluf"" corresponds to the output ""green blue blue"". We can safely assume that ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""bluf"" is ""blue"", indicating ""lug"" is again ""blue"".

4. ""lug dax"" corresponds to ""blue green"". Here ""dax"" is again appearing as ""green"", which implies ""lug"" would be ""blue"".

5. In the fifth example, ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" output is ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow"". The sequence and repetition of ""walm"" and ""zup"" after ""lug"" translate to a pattern of ""yellow yellow yellow,"" leaving the ""blue"" as the output for ""lug"".

Based on this analysis, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,41,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,41,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue."" We can reach this conclusion from the consistent substitution of ""blue"" whenever ""lug"" appears in the inputs:

- In the first input, ""dax lug"" corresponds to ""green blue,"" and we see ""dax"" again later corresponding to ""green,"" which isolates ""lug"" as ""blue.""
- The second input further supports the isolated relationship as ""lug dax"" results in ""blue green.""
- The third and fourth inputs consistently repeat this pattern.
- The fifth input places ""lug"" amidst other color words, still resulting in ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,41,lug
"Analyzing the examples given and the corresponding output:

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

Input: zup dax lug
Output: yellow green blue

Input: wif dax wif
Output: red green red

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

From these examples, we can try to determine what ""dax"" corresponds to in the outputs:

1. In the first line, ""dax"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output of ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""dax"" outputs ""green."" 
2. In the second line, ""dax"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""lug,"" the outputs are ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" respectively. The ""dax"" again outputs ""green.""
3. In the third line, ""dax"" is both preceded and followed by ""wif,"" which outputs ""red,"" and the ""dax"" still outputs ""green.""
4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" is followed by different words (""zup"" and ""bluf"") and still results in ""green"" each time.
5. In the fifth example, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" and it still results in ""green.""

In each case, regardless of the preceding or following words, the output for ""dax"" is ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,41,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. This deduction is consistent across all examples, as every instance of ""dax"" leads to the output of the color green, regardless of the words that come before or after it.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,41,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""dax"" by examining the pattern of word-to-color translations before and after ""dax"" appears.

Observations:
- The word following ""dax"" is always translated to ""green.""
- This suggests that ""dax"" might be indicative for the word that comes right after it, which becomes ""green"" in the output.
- In all instances, there is no case where ""dax"" precedes a word that does not translate to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""dax"" -> The next word translates to ""green.""",1.0,41,dax
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" results in the color ""green."" However, there might be a context-dependent rule for ""dax"" because the color that follows ""dax"" changes based on the preceding word. Let's try to analyse each example to identify the rule:

1. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   The word ""dax"" here results in ""green"" following ""walm"" which is ""blue.""

2. Input: zup dax lug
   Output: yellow green blue
   The word ""dax"" results in ""green"" following ""zup"" which is ""yellow.""

3. Input: wif dax wif
   Output: red green red
   The word ""dax"" again leads to ""green"" and is flanked by ""wif"" which translates to ""red.""

4. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green
   The word ""dax"" twice results in ""green"" once following ""wif"" (""red"") and another time following ""wif"" before ""bluf"" which is not in the previous line (possibly green looking at the sequence).

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   Here, ""dax"" follows ""bluf,"" which in this case we can infer to possibly mean ""green"" based on previous logic.

Working from this, we can deduce a working hypothesis for ""dax"" being that it simply translates to the color ""green"" regardless of context, as no other contextual dependency is apparent from the provided examples.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,41,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""

Example analysis:

1. lug walm dax wif lug wif -> blue blue green red blue red; ""dax"" follows ""walm"" and results in ""green.""
2. zup dax lug -> yellow green blue; ""dax"" follows ""zup"" and results in ""green.""
3. wif dax wif -> red green red; ""dax"" is surrounded by ""wif"" on both sides, with the result being ""green.""
4. wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> red green yellow red green green; ""dax"" appears twice and translates to ""green"" in both instances.
5. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green; ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" and leads to ""walm,"" resulting in ""green green.""

Each occurrence of ""dax"" in the examples corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of the words that come before or after it.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,41,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" can be consistently associated with the color ""red."" Each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the corresponding output.

Thus, the rule can be stated as:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" is an input, ""red"" is included in the output.",1.0,41,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" The other words in the examples also seem to correspond to specific colors, such as ""lug"" to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The word ""dax"" may correspond to ""green"" and ""bluf"" might be another instance for ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,41,wif

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""",1.0,41,wif
"Based on the examples provided:

Input: wif -> Output: red
Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow
Input: dax lug wif bluf -> Output: green blue red red
Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow

It can be deduced that:

wif -> meaning. Rule: When ""wif"" appears in an input, the output includes the color ""red"". This seems to be consistent regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input or the other words present.

Therefore, the rule is: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".",1.0,41,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red'.",1.0,41,wif

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.",1.0,41,zup

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,41,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" seems consistent across all instances:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow.""

Therefore, we can deduce the following:

zup -> yellow. Rule: Whenever ""zup"" is present, its corresponding output is ""yellow.""",1.0,41,zup
"Based on the examples provided, each input word seems to correspond to a particular color in the output. The word ""zup"" consistently results in the color ""yellow"" no matter its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule appears to be straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,41,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must look at the association between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. The word ""bluf"" seems to be tied to a specific color output, which changes based on the words around it.

For the first input, ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""dax"" before and after, resulting in ""yellow."" However, ""dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green."" This suggests that ""bluf"" may be modifying the color output associated with ""dax.""

In the second input, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and both produce ""blue."" It seems that ""bluf"" adopts the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

In the third input, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and both words output ""red."" As with the second input, ""bluf"" mirrors the color of the preceding word.

The fourth input reinforces the hypothesis, as ""bluf"" again follows ""wif"" and both have the output ""red,"" and when followed by ""lug,"" ""bluf"" changes the output to ""blue,"" consistent with the color of ""lug.""

The fifth input further supports the idea, with ""bluf"" following ""lug"" and ""dax"" and adopting the colors ""blue"" and ""green,"" respectively, as associated with these words.

From these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color output associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

So:

bluf -> Takes on the color output of the preceding word.",1.0,41,bluf
"Analyzing the provided examples, I observe the following patterns:

1. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: green green yellow yellow green
   - Here, bluf follows dax and precedes zup, resulting in 'green' being followed by 'yellow'.

2. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue
   - Here, bluf follows lug, and both output 'blue'. 

3. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
   Output: red green red red yellow red
   - In this case, bluf is between 'wif', which consistently outputs 'red', and 'zup', which consistently outputs 'yellow', but following 'wif', it results in another 'red'.

4. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   - Once again, bluf is following 'wif', resulting in 'red', and it is followed by 'lug', which outputs 'blue'.

5. Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
   Output: red red blue green red
   - Here, the bluf is between 'wif' and 'lug', just like in the previous example, and the outputs are 'red' and 'blue', respectively.

From these patterns, it appears that the meaning of ""bluf"" is not dependent on the word itself, but on the word that immediately precedes it in the input. Specifically, bluf takes on the color corresponding to the word that comes before it:

- When preceded by 'dax', bluf takes on the color 'green'.
- When preceded by 'lug', bluf takes on the color 'blue'.
- When preceded by 'wif', bluf takes on the color 'red'.

Therefore, the rule according to the examples provided is:

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color output of the preceding word.",1.0,41,bluf
"Considering the provided examples, let's try to deduce the pattern related to the usage of ""bluf.""

- In the first input, ""dax bluf zup bluf dax,"" the word ""bluf"" appears between the same words and yields the color repeated (""green green"" and then ""yellow yellow"") before and after the word ""dax"" is presented again in a different color (""green""). This could mean that ""bluf"" could have an influence on color repetition based on its position relative to other words.

- In the second input, ""lug bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue,"" which may suggest that ""bluf"" here mimics the preceding word's color output.

- In the third input, ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif,"" we see that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" but when ""bluf"" is used after ""wif,"" no color is produced for ""bluf,"" yet ""zup"" that follows ""bluf"" is ""yellow."" Here it's more difficult to determine the pattern since ""bluf"" doesn't align with a consistent output.

- In the fourth input, ""wif bluf lug,"" again, ""bluf"" does not have a designated color but seems to repeat the color of the preceding word, ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

- In the fifth input, ""wif bluf lug dax wif,"" ""bluf"" once more repeats the color of ""wif"" (""red""), but does not affect the color of ""lug"" (which is ""blue"") or ""dax"" (which is ""green"").

Given these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word preceding it and does not have a color of its own. It essentially repeats the color output of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",0.8,41,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color attribute of the word that immediately follows it. If no word follows it, then ""bluf"" repeats the color attribute of the word immediately preceding it. Here's the analysis:

- In ""dax bluf zup bluf dax,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. ""Bluf"" after ""dax"" also becomes green, and ""bluf"" after ""zup"" becomes yellow. At the end, ""bluf"" occurs after ""zup"" and before ""dax,"" thus repeating the color yellow of ""zup.""
- In ""lug bluf,"" ""lug"" is blue, and ""bluf"" follows, also taking on the color blue.
- In ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif,"" ""wif"" is red, ""dax"" is green, and ""zup"" is yellow. ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" and takes on its color, red.
- In ""wif bluf lug,"" ""wif"" is red, ""bluf"" follows and takes on the color red, and ""lug"" is blue.
- In ""wif bluf lug dax wif,"" ""wif"" is red, ""bluf"" takes on red after ""wif,"" ""lug"" is blue, ""dax"" is green, and the last ""wif"" is red again.

Taking these observations, we can define the rule:

Rule: ""Bluf"" takes on the color attribute of the word that immediately follows it. If there is no word that follows, then ""bluf"" takes on the color attribute of the word that immediately precedes it.

Hence:

bluf -> meaning: the color of the preceding word if there is no following word, or the color of the following word if there is one.",0.8,41,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""red."" 

When ""bluf"" is used, the corresponding output is always ""red."" In every example provided, the appearance of ""bluf"" directly equates to red in the output sequence regardless of the words that precede or follow it.",0.0,41,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" translates to repeating the color associated with the previous word three times. For instance:

- In ""wif walm dax,"" ""wif"" is translated as ""red."" ""Walm"" following ""wif"" results in ""red red red.""
- In ""zup walm dax lug,"" ""zup"" is translated as ""yellow,"" and after ""walm"" is used, ""yellow yellow yellow"" appears.
- In ""dax walm zup lug,"" ""dax"" is translated as ""green,"" and ""walm"" gives ""green green green.""

It does not seem to matter what word follows ""walm""; the previous color is simply repeated three times. 

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times.",1.0,41,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following rule for the word ""walm"":

When ""walm"" follows a word, the output color for ""walm"" is the same as that word repeated three times. For instance, when ""dax"" (green) precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green."" When ""walm"" is the first word, it outputs the color red repeated three times. From this, we can conclude that ""walm"" likely means to repeat the color of the previous word three times unless it is the first word, in which case it defaults to red.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times; if ""walm"" is the first word, output ""red red red"".",1.0,41,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word 'walm' appears to stand for a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it three times. Therefore, 'walm' replicates the last mentioned color prior to itself, following the pattern shown in the examples. 

For instance, in the first example, 'dax lug dax lug' yields 'green blue green blue', and when 'walm' follows, the output is 'blue blue blue' as 'lug' associates with the color blue. Similarly, in the second example, 'wif' is associated with the color red, and 'walm' follows it, thus the output for 'walm' is 'red red red'. This rule is consistent across all the provided examples.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,41,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns of words and their corresponding colors. Here are the observed patterns:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears in an input, the following word, if there is one, is translated to ""green."" For example, ""dax"" translates to ""green"" instead of its usual ""blue"" if it follows ""walm.""
- If ""walm"" is the last word, or if it appears without a following word, the output is a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding ""walm,"" repeated three times.

Here are the examples with this rule applied:

1. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" -> green (dax), blue (lug), green (dax), blue (lug), blue blue (walm repeats lug's color since there's no word after walm)
2. ""wif walm dax"" -> red (wif), red red (walm repeats wif's color), green (walm changes the color of dax)
3. ""zup walm dax lug"" -> yellow (zup), yellow yellow (walm repeats zup's color), green (walm changes the color of dax), blue (lug)
4. ""dax walm zup lug"" -> green (dax), green green (walm repeats dax's color), yellow (zup), blue (lug)
5. ""zup walm"" -> yellow (zup), yellow yellow (walm repeats zup's color)

Based on this analysis, we can deduce:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the following word to translate to ""green"" in the output. If there is no following word, ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the translated color of the word before it three times. 

So, walm -> meaning: ""walm"" changes the following word to the color ""green,"" or if it's the final word, it repeats the previous color three times.",1.0,41,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previously mentioned item thrice. 

The word ""walm"" causes the previous color to be repeated three times. For example, when ""dax"" (which means green) is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""green"" repeated three times. Similarly, ""wif"" (red) followed by ""walm"" results in ""red"" repeated three times, and ""zup"" (yellow) followed by ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" repeated three times.",0.8,41,walm

"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently maps to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.",1.0,42,lug
"Given the examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs. Here is how this conclusion is reached:

- In each instance where ""dax"" appears, the word ""green"" also appears in the respective output at the same position.
- The word ""dax"" is not dependent on the position in the sentence, as it appears in different positions and always maps to ""green.""
- In all outputs, every other word that surrounds ""dax"" correlates with a different color. For example, ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" maps to ""blue."" These words maintain their respective color outputs regardless of the position of ""dax.""

"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to correlate with repeating the color associated with the word that directly precedes it an additional two times. Here is the induction based on the given input-output pairs:

1. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" translates to ""red blue green blue red red red blue red."" We see that ""wif"" which means red is followed by ""walm"" which causes ""red"" to repeat two more times, making three reds in a row.

2. ""dax wif walm"" translates to ""green red red red."" Again, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in ""red"" being repeated two more times.

3. ""lug walm zup"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow."" Here ""lug"" means blue, which is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in two more ""blue.""

4. ""wif walm zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" ""Wif"" means red, and ""zup"" means yellow, with both followed by ""walm,"" each causing their colors to be repeated two additional times.

"Rule: walm -> ""repeat the color of the previous word one additional time"". 

The term ""walm"" does not correspond to a new color, but rather instructs to repeat the color that was named right before the occurrence of ""walm."" This is evident as each instance of ""walm"" in the examples results in an added repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it.
",1.0,42,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to correspond to the repetition of the color associated with the previous word. For instance, if the previous word corresponds to ""red,"" then ""walm"" means repeating the color red for as many times as ""walm"" appears.",1.0,42,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare each of the given input-output pairs systematically:

- In ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif,"" the output sequence ""red red green green red red red blue red"" corresponds to all the words except ""walm."" If we align them, we see that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" to ""green,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" results in the addition of one ""red.""

- In ""dax wif walm,"" the output is ""green red red red."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" to the additional ""red.""

- In ""lug walm zup,"" the output is ""blue blue blue yellow."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" results in the addition of two ""blue.""

- In ""wif walm zup walm,"" the output is ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and each ""walm"" corresponds to additional instances of the preceding color, ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively.

- In ""zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" again corresponds to additional instances of the preceding color.

Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the immediately preceding word in the sequence an additional number of times. The exact number of repetitions may vary with context, but the basic rule appears to be that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the previously mentioned color.

Therefore:

walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word in the sequence an additional number of times.",0.9,42,walm
"From the given examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" is linked to the repetition of a color word that directly follows it, with each instance of ""walm"" corresponding to a repetition of the next color word equal to the number of times ""walm"" has occurred in sequence.

Here is the evidence that supports this rule:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which translates to ""red""), it is repeated three times (since ""walm"" occurs once) in the second example: wif walm -> red red red red.
2. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue""), it is repeated twice in the third example: lug walm zup -> blue blue blue yellow.
3. When ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow""), it results in three yellows in the fourth example: wif walm zup walm -> red red red yellow yellow yellow.
4. When ""walm"" stands alone before ""zup"" in the fifth example, it still results in three yellows: zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow.

Based on these examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears, it causes the color word that comes after it to be repeated three times in the output, regardless of what color word precedes it. If multiple ""walm"" follow each other, they cause repetitions of the next color word equal to the number of ""walm"" times.

So we can define ""walm"" as:

walm -> Repeats the following color word three times.",0.8,42,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the outputs, regardless of its position in the input string.",1.0,43,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: Each time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.",1.0,43,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each of the given examples.",1.0,43,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is associated with the color blue. Whenever ""lug"" is present in the input, ""blue"" is included in the output.",1.0,43,lug
"Based on the given examples, we can observe the output that correlates with the presence of the nonce word ""lug."" In all instances where ""lug"" is present, the color ""blue"" appears in the output. Additionally, ""lug"" does not always appear in the same position within the input, suggesting that its meaning is not dependent on its position. 

Let's examine the position of ""lug"" and the corresponding output:

1. Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
2. Input: zup walm lug wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
3. Input: lug wif walm -> Output: blue red red red
4. Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow
5. Input: lug -> Output: blue

By analyzing these examples, the term ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue"" being present in the output, regardless of where ""lug"" appears in the input or what other words accompany it.

Rule: lug -> ""blue""",1.0,43,lug
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" I will analyze the given examples and outputs.

Input: dax
Output: green
- Here, ""dax"" directly translates to ""green.""

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- ""wif"" and ""walm"" both translate to ""red,"" and ""zup"" translates to yellow. Importantly, ""dax"" still translates to ""green"" regardless of its position.

Input: lug dax zup dax wif
Output: blue green yellow green red
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""dax"" is consistently ""green,"" again regardless of its position.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- Each occurrence of ""dax"" results in ""green,"" and since ""walm"" followed ""dax,"" it also translated to ""green."" 

In the prior examples, ""wif"" and ""walm"" have translated to ""red"" when ""dax"" was not preceding them. Here ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which suggests that ""dax"" may affect the word following it.

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
- ""dax"" first translates to ""green,"" but ""lug,"" which normally is ""blue,"" comes after ""dax"" unchanged, which breaks the pattern of ""dax"" affecting the following word. ""walm"" which followed ""lug"" also translates to ""blue"" instead of the expected ""red."" ""zup"" again is ""yellow"" and ""wif"" returns to ""red.""

Rule:

dax -> green
- We can conclude with certainty that ""dax"" means ""green,"" since in every example, ""dax"" always results in the color ""green"" regardless of its position.

There might be additional, more complex rules affecting the other words in sequences where ""dax"" is present, or there might be inaccuracies in the provided outputs. However, with the given information, we can only confirm the consistent translation of ""dax"" to ""green.""",1.0,43,dax
"From the examples provided, we can infer that ""dax"" corresponds to a specific color output. Each instance of ""dax"" results in the output ""green."" Other words produce different colors, but ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green."" The color produced by other words seems to depend on their position or possibly their sequence, but ""dax"" consistently results in the same color regardless of its position.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,43,dax
"dax -> green. Rule: Each time the word ""dax"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""green"", regardless of its position within the input sequence.",1.0,43,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to a color, specifically the color green. We can see this because in each input, whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding location in the output.

Thus the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,43,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" I will analyze the provided input-output pairs and look for patterns that can hint at the underlying rule.

Taking a closer look:

1. Input: dax Output: green
- A single ""dax"" results in ""green.""

2. Input: wif walm dax zup Output: red red red green yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

3. Input: lug dax zup dax wif Output: blue green yellow green red
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- Another ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

4. Input: dax walm Output: green green green
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" corresponds to the same color as preceded by ""dax,"" in this case, ""green""

5. Input: dax lug walm zup wif Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" corresponds to the same color as preceded by ""lug,"" in this case, ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Based on these observations, ""dax"" seems to consistently correspond to the color ""green."" However, the occurrence of ""walm"" behaving differently depending on its position and the preceding word suggests that the nonce word in question might influence the subsequent words. In example 4, ""walm"" following ""dax"" also turned ""green,"" hinting that ""dax"" might have the rule of setting the output to ""green"" and affecting the subsequent word to match its output color when it directly follows.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""dax"" results in the output ""green"" and has the potential to change the output color of the word that directly follows it to ""green"" as well. Other words have their fixed colors unless influenced by ""dax.""",0.8,43,dax

"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" is translated to a color repeated as many times as the immediately preceding color mentioned before it in the sequence. To illustrate:

- In the first example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" means blue, and ""bluf"" repeats that color.
- In the second example, there's no color before ""bluf,"" so it only repeats the previous color once, ""yellow,"" which is represented by ""zup.""
- In the third example, ""lug bluf"" again translates to ""blue blue"" following the same logic.
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" as ""wif"" means red, and ""bluf"" repeats it.
- The fifth example is straightforward as ""wif bluf"" directly translates to ""red red.""

Rule: bluf -> The color word that immediately precedes ""bluf"" is repeated as many times as that color was in sequence before ""bluf."" If no color precedes it, ""bluf"" repeats the last mentioned color only once.",1.0,43,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be associated with a color, and more specifically, it corresponds to the color that came just before it in the sequence. Here are the relevant parts from the examples that help deduce this pattern:

- Example 1: lug bluf -> blue blue
  (Here ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which translated to ""blue"".)

- Example 2: zup bluf -> yellow yellow
  (Here ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which translated to ""yellow"".)

- Example 3: lug bluf -> blue blue 
  (Same as the first, ""bluf"" after ""lug"" gives ""blue blue"".)

- Example 4: wif bluf -> red red
  (Here ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which translated to ""red"".)

- Example 5: wif bluf -> red red
  (Here again, ""bluf"" after ""wif"" gives ""red red"".)

Given this consistent pattern, the meaning of ""bluf"" can be interpreted as a word that takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> the color of the preceding word.",1.0,43,bluf
"bluf -> repeats the color word before it.

Rule:
If the word ""bluf"" follows any color-associated word, it repeats that color word in the output. If ""bluf"" is the first word or does not follow a color word, it outputs ""red"" by default.",1.0,43,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to the color that precedes it directly in the sequence. If there is no color before ""bluf,"" it defaults to ""red."" Here's the breakdown according to each example:

1. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Rule applied: ""lug"" before the first bluf means the color blue. Next ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"" which means green, so ""bluf"" becomes green here. There is no color before the third ""bluf,"" thus it defaults to ""red,"" but since the pattern does not show ""red"" before any ""bluf,"" the rule of defaulting to ""red"" doesn't apply here. Instead, it repeats the color blue, which can be explained by a default to the preceding color, or considering ""wif"" is not shown but is followed by a ""bluf"" which indicates red, it might indicate the repeated pattern of the last stated color if no new color has been introduced.

2. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   Rule applied: ""bluf"" repeats the yellow from ""zup"".

3. Input: dax zup lug bluf
   Output: green yellow blue blue
   Rule applied: ""bluf"" repeats the blue from ""lug"".

4. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue yellow red red green
   Rule applied: ""bluf"" repeats the red from ""wif"".

5. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   Rule applied: ""bluf"" repeats the red from ""wif"".

Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf repeats the color of the word immediately before it. If ""bluf"" is the first word or no color word is before it, ""bluf"" defaults to red.

"Walm -> repetition of the color associated with the previous word. Rule:

- When ""lug"" appears before ""walm,"" the resulting output is ""blue blue blue,"" which suggests that ""lug"" translates to the color blue, and ""walm"" indicates a repetition of that color.
- When ""wif"" appears before ""walm,"" the resulting output is ""red red red,"" which suggests that ""wif"" translates to the color red, and ""walm"" similarly indicates a repetition of the preceding color.
- When ""zup"" appears before ""lug"" and then followed by ""walm,"" as in ""zup lug zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" here ""zup"" translates to the color yellow, ""lug"" to blue, and ""walm"" leads to the repetition of yellow after ""zup"" is repeated, even though ""lug"" appears between the ""zup"" and ""walm.""
- When ""zup"" is before ""wif"" followed by ""walm,"" the sequence ""zup wif walm"" gives us ""yellow red red red,"" which continues to support the idea that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word (""wif"" in this case).
- The last example, ""lug walm,"" again outputs ""blue blue blue,"" reinforcing the initial rule observed.

Therefore, ""walm"" indicates that the color associated with the preceding word should be repeated three times.",1.0,43,walm
"Walm -> repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. 

Rule: When 'walm' follows another word, the color that is associated with the preceding word is repeated three times for 'lug' (blue) and 'wif' (red), as shown in the first two examples. In the third example, 'zup bluf lug zup walm', it follows that 'zup' (yellow) is the preceding word for 'walm', and therefore the output is yellow repeated three times. However, given the sequence 'zup bluf lug zup', we can deduce that 'bluf' could be related to the color blue, but it appears only once after 'bluf', which might indicate that 'walm' was not present to cause a repetition. The absence of 'walm' after 'bluf' suggests that 'walm' triggers the repetition, not 'bluf'. Hence, 'walm' seems to function as an instruction for repeating the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.",1.0,43,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to indicate a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that directly precedes it. Here are the rules deduced from each example:

2. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red"": In this case, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red, and the output is ""red"" repeated three times.

3. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"": ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" corresponds to the color yellow, and the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times after the sequence before ""walm.""

4. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red"": Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" corresponding to the color red, and the output is ""red"" repeated three times after ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup.""

5. The repetition of ""lug walm"" yielding the same output ""blue blue blue"" confirms the consistency of ""walm"" representing a triplication of the color word before it.

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" follows another word, the output is the color associated with that preceding word repeated three times. For instance, ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" so ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" Similarly, ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" thus ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red."" In multi-word sequences where ""walm"" follows after multiple color-associated words, only the color of the immediate precedent word to ""walm"" is repeated three times.",1.0,43,walm
"Based on the given examples, the meaning of ""walm"" appears to be dependent on the word that directly precedes it. Each instance of ""walm"" follows a word that corresponds to a certain color, and the output is a repetition of the color mentioned before ""walm"".

1. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue blue blue"".
2. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red red"".
3. When ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow"" repeated once less than the number of times ""zup"" appears before ""walm"".

Given the above observations, ""walm"" seems to act as a command to repeat the color of its antecedent word a specified number of times. Based on the data:

- ""wif walm"" => ""red red red"" (repeats ""red"" three times)
- ""zup walm"" => ""yellow"" repeated once less than the number of ""zup"" appearances.

   Analysis: ""dax"" stands for ""green"", ""walm"" appears twice and each time it is followed by ""red"" and repeats of the color word just before it, ""green"" after the first ""walm"" and ""green"" after the second ""walm"".

4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   Analysis: Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"" and hence after ""red"" we see ""blue"" repeated.

5. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   Analysis: ""lug"" equals ""blue"", so after ""walm"" we see a ""red"" followed by ""yellow"" which corresponds to ""zup"" that comes before the next ""wif"".

Based on this analysis, ""walm"" seems to be an instruction for a color pattern in the following form:
- First, output ""red"".
- Next, repeat the color word that appeared immediately before ""walm"" in the input.

Therefore, the rule is:

walm -> meaning: Output ""red"" followed by repetitions of the color corresponding to the word just before ""walm"".

Rule: When ""walm"" appears after a color word in the input, the output is ""red"" followed by the color of the preceding word in the input repeated.",1.0,44,walm
"By examining the given examples, we can deduce the following pattern for the word 'walm':

- In the first example, the output after the word 'walm' changes from 'green' to 'red'. This suggests that 'walm' might indicate a change or a switch.
- In the second example, 'lug walm' causes a switch from 'blue' to 'red' then back to 'blue', which again suggests a change associated with 'walm'.
- The third example supports this pattern, with 'dax walm' changing from 'green' to 'red', then 'lug dax walm' changing from 'blue green' to 'green green green'.
- The fourth example confirms the pattern with 'lug walm' changing from 'blue' to 'red', and the 'walm' causes a subsequent switch in color.
- Likewise, the fifth example supports this with 'lug walm' changing from 'blue' to 'red'.

Therefore, the word 'walm' likely represents a rule where it signifies a change in the sequence of the colors that follow it.

Rule: walm -> signifies a change in the sequence or color pattern that follows it.",0.8,44,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to trigger a repetition of the color associated with the word that follows it three times, then it changes the following color's output to red. Analyzing the given examples:

1. In ""dax walm wif walm,"" ""dax"" is associated with green once, but after ""walm"" it is repeated three times as green, and ""wif"" is associated with red three times, not its usual red.

2. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" has ""lug"" associated with blue, repeated three times after ""walm,"" and ""wif"" changes to red, even though it is ordinarily associated with red.

3. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" results in ""dax"" repeating as green three times after ""walm,"" ""wif"" changing to red (instead of its normal red), and then ""lug"" as blue followed by ""dax"" being repeated as green three times after ""walm.""

4. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" shows ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""bluf"" in their associated colors followed by ""lug"" repeated as blue three times after ""walm,"" and ""dax"" changing to red (green).

5. Finally, ""lug walm wif zup wif"" demonstrates ""lug"" repeated as blue three times after ""walm"" and ""wif"" changing to red, with ""zup"" maintaining its yellow association.

To summarize the observed rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the following color word to output its associated color three times, followed by changing the subsequent color's output to red.

So, walm -> triggers the next color word to output thrice, followed by turning the next color red.",0.8,44,walm
"The word ""walm"" appears to signal a change in the color pattern, but not necessarily to a color itself. We can see that after ""walm"" is used, a new color word is introduced and a new color pattern starts. Here's how it breaks down:

- ""dax walm wif walm"" = green green green red red red
  ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""walm"", ""wif"" changes the pattern to red.

- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" = blue blue blue red blue blue
  ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm"", ""wif"" changes the pattern to red, then it switches back to ""lug"" with blue.

- ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" = green green green red blue green green green
  ""dax"" is green, ""walm"" changes the pattern, ""wif"" becomes red, then ""lug"" changes the pattern to blue, and after ""dax walm"", it goes back to green.

- ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" = red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
  Here, ""wif"" is red, ""zup"" changes it to yellow, ""bluf"" and ""lug"" remain consistent with the previous colors, after ""walm"" the next color ""dax"" is green.

- ""lug walm wif zup wif"" = blue blue blue red yellow red
  ""lug"" is blue, after ""walm"" the next color ""wif"" is red, and then ""zup"" changes it to yellow.

Based on these patterns, ""walm"" appears to be an indicator for a subsequent color change. However, it does not produce a color itself.

Rule: walm -> signals the next color change",0.8,44,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in the examples provided and the colors that correspond to the contexts in which ""walm"" is used.

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red

In this example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""wif,"" resulting in the pattern ""green green green red."" When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the pattern continues with ""red.""

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" but the output is ""red,"" not ""blue.""

Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output: green green green red blue green green green

Again, ""walm"" follows different words, ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and the output pattern is ""green green green red blue green green green.""

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" with the output as ""blue blue blue green,"" which deviates from the expected ""blue"" to ""green.""

Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

In this sequence, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""wif,"" resulting in ""blue blue blue red.""

From these patterns, we can induce that ""walm"" may change the expected output color to red, regardless of the color corresponding to the word that precedes it. However, after observing the third and fourth examples, we notice that ""walm"" following ""lug dax"" results in ""green,"" not ""red,"" which makes our rule a bit more complex. At the same time, ""wif walm"" consistently results in ""red red.""

As a result, the rule for ""walm"" can be considered context-dependent, and looks like this:

When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" ""wif,"" or ""lug"" alone, it changes the output color to ""red."" However, if ""walm"" follows a sequence of other colors (like ""lug dax""), it maintains the pattern and uses the color of the last word before ""walm.""

Thus, the approximate rule for ""walm"" could be:
- walm -> meaning : If preceded by a single word, output ""red."" If preceded by a sequence, output continues the last color in the sequence before ""walm.""

Therefore:
walm -> meaning. Meaning is context-dependent; generally changes the output to ""red"" but can defer to the last color in a sequence preceding it. Rule: If preceded by a single word, output ""red."" If preceded by a sequence, preserve the last color of the sequence.",0.7,44,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,45,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" This can be inferred from the fact that in each example, regardless of the other nonce words (such as ""wif,"" ""zup,"" or ""dax"") the output always includes ""blue"" whenever ""lug"" is present.

For instance:

- When the input is solely ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
- When ""lug"" is combined with ""wif,"" the output includes ""red blue,"" suggesting ""wif"" means ""red.""
- With the input ""lug zup dax zup,"" the sequence of colors that corresponds to ""zup dax zup"" is ""yellow green yellow,"" and given that ""lug"" precedes this sequence, ""blue"" is inserted before it.
- In the final example, ""dax lug dax lug walm,"" there seems to be a repetition of ""green blue"" for each ""dax lug"" sequence. With ""walm"" at the end outputting ""blue blue,"" it indicates that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue,"" while the term ""walm"" possibly has a rule leading to a double ""blue"" output. This seems to complicate the rule, as ""walm"" isn't alone and follows a repeated pattern of ""dax lug.""

From these observations, the rule for ""lug"" can be formed as:
Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,45,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can determine that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule:

"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example.",1.0,45,lug
"Based on the examples given:

- ""lug"" by itself translates to ""blue""
- When ""lug"" is paired with ""wif,"" the output is ""red blue,"" which suggests ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- When ""lug"" is in a sequence with ""zup,"" the output is ""blue yellow,"" and when ""dax"" is present, it translates to ""green,"" suggesting ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green""
- In the last example, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" but ""walm"" after ""lug"" yields ""blue blue."" There's no clear translation for ""walm,"" but it may be inferred that it somehow reinforces or duplicates the ""blue"" from ""lug.""

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the meaning of the word ""wif"" is consistent regardless of context. Each time ""wif"" is presented as an input, the output is always ""red"". Therefore, the rule can be inferred as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,45,wif
"Based on the provided examples, wif consistently translates to the color red. No matter its position in a sequence, it always corresponds to this same output. Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.",1.0,45,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the following patterns emerge:

- Whenever the word 'zup' is present, the output always includes the color 'yellow'.
- The word 'wif' always corresponds to the color 'red'.
- The presence of 'dax' translates to the color 'green'.
- The word 'walm' seems to correspond to the color 'red' when it appears after 'wif', but it results in 'yellow' when it appears after 'zup' or on its own.

Parsing each example:

1. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   Analysis: 'zup' translates to 'yellow', 'wif' to 'red', and 'bluf' has no direct translation but still results in 'red'.
   
2. Input: dax zup dax zup wif
   Output: green yellow green yellow red
   Analysis: 'dax' translates to 'green', 'zup' to 'yellow', and 'wif' to 'red'. Since 'zup' follows 'dax', it maintains its translation to 'yellow'.

3. Input: zup
   Output: yellow
   Analysis: The sole instance of 'zup' translates directly to 'yellow'.

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Analysis: 'zup' translates to 'yellow', 'wif' to 'red', and 'walm' following 'wif' results in 'red'. This suggests the color for 'walm' may depend on its position or preceding words.

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: 'zup' translates to 'yellow', and 'walm' following 'zup' also results in 'yellow'. This differs from the previous interpretation of 'walm'.

Considering the examples consistently and collectively, it seems that 'zup' on its own means 'yellow'. Other words in the examples may modify the meaning of subsequent words, but for each instance of 'zup', the meaning is consistent:

Rule: 'zup' -> yellow.",1.0,45,zup

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"".

"Based on the provided examples, we observe that each instance of the word ""zup"" produces the output ""yellow"". No context is provided that alters the meaning of ""zup"" when it is in combination with other words. Therefore, the rule can be simply stated as:

"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

Input: zup wif bluf

- The word ""zup"" results in the output ""yellow"".
- The word ""wif"" occurs here and in other examples, always resulting in the output ""red"".

Input: dax zup dax zup wif

- The new word ""walm"" appears here for the first time, and given that ""wif"" precedes it and the output is ""red red red"" after ""yellow"", it indicates that ""walm"" also results in ""red"".

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- This shows that ""walm"" does not always result in ""red"" as previously interpreted. In the absence of ""wif"" before it, ""walm"" results in ""yellow"".

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"", regardless of its position or what other words are around it.

"Rule: 'bluf' -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.

Explanation:
- In the first example, 'dax' corresponds to green, 'wif' to red, and 'zup' to yellow. When 'bluf' follows 'dax,' it repeats the color of 'dax,' which is green.
- In the second example, 'bluf' follows 'wif' and repeats its color, which is red.
- In the third example, 'bluf' immediately follows 'dax,' and the output is green again because 'dax' is associated with green.
- In the fourth and fifth examples, 'bluf' follows 'zup' and 'lug' respectively, repeating the color yellow for 'zup' and blue for 'lug.' 

So, the rule is that 'bluf' takes on the color of the word it directly follows in the sequence.",1.0,45,bluf
"Analyzing the given examples, the aim is to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" based on the input and corresponding color output.

Let's examine the examples:

1. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
   Output: green green red yellow green
- 'dax' corresponds to 'green' both times it's mentioned.
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red'.
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'.

2. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red
- 'dax' corresponds to 'green'.
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red'.
- Since 'dax' is green, if 'bluf' corresponded directly to a color, the third color would not be 'red'. Instead, it's the same color as 'wif'.

3. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
- 'dax' corresponds to 'green'.
- 'bluf' leads to another 'green' which is the same color as 'dax'.

4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'.
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red'.
- Since 'zup' is yellow, 'bluf' leads to the same color 'yellow' following it.

5. Input: zup bluf lug zup
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'.
- 'lug' is the only word that corresponds to 'blue'.
- 'bluf' is followed by the color 'yellow', same as the first 'zup'.

From these observations, it can be induced that 'bluf' represents a rule that produces the same color as the word preceding it or duplicates the color output of the word immediately prior to 'bluf'.

Rule: bluf -> duplicate the color of the previous word.",1.0,45,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we will analyze the position of the word and the corresponding color in each output:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the color green is repeated (""dax bluf"" -> green green).
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the color yellow is repeated (""zup bluf"" -> yellow yellow).
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the color red is not repeated but instead, ""wif"" is red and ""bluf"" corresponds to the prior color before ""wif"" appeared in the sequence. (""zup bluf wif"" -> yellow yellow red).

Based on the observations, ""bluf"" causes the output color to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it. There is an exception when ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" where it looks back to the color before ""wif."" The rule appears to be: ""bluf"" takes the color associated with the previous word and uses that as its output color unless intervened by special words like ""wif.""

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it (different behavior may occur if followed by specific words such as ""wif"").",0.9,45,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to change its meaning depending on the word that comes immediately before it. Here is the rule based on the examples:

- When ""dax"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""
- When ""wif"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
- When ""zup"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- When ""lug"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue.""

This indicates that ""bluf"" takes the color associated with the preceding word and outputs it twice.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color associated with the preceding word.",0.8,45,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the provided inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""wif walm zup walm""
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
   The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red red,"" and ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" seems to be followed by three of a color, based on the pattern we see with ""zup walm.""

2. ""zup walm""
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   ""Zup"" on its own results in ""yellow,"" but the appearance of the word ""walm"" after any word results in a triple repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

3. ""lug walm zup lug walm""
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   Once again, ""lug"" on its own is associated with ""blue,"" and ""walm"" results in a triple repetition of that color.

4. ""wif bluf dax walm""
   Output: red red green green green
   The pattern here remains consistent. ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""bluf"" isn't given, but ""dax"" corresponds with the color ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times.

5. ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm""
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   In this example, each word has a color associated with it, and ""walm"" once again causes a triple repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes a triple repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> causes a triple repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,45,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look closely at the patterns in the provided examples.

Input: wif walm zup walm
Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow

In this example, ""wif"" is followed by three repetitions of ""red,"" and each instance of ""walm"" is followed by three repetitions of ""yellow.""

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""zup"" is immediately followed by three ""yellow,"" which suggests ""walm"" also translates to three occurrences of ""yellow"" as in the first example.

Input: lug walm zup lug walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

Here, ""lug"" is followed by three ""blue,"" and again we see ""walm"" associated with ""yellow."" It appears that ""zup"" does not affect the color following ""walm"" since the output does not change and remains ""yellow.""

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

In this example, ""wif"" translates to two ""red,"" but ""walm"" does not appear to directly lead to a specific color since the output does not contain ""yellow."" Here, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and results in three ""green,"" which suggests ""walm"" might not have a fixed meaning on its own or its meaning might be context-dependent.

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

In this mixed sequence, ""wif"" again results in ""red,"" ""dax"" in ""green,"" and ""zup"" in ""yellow."" When ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" it results in ""red,"" but when followed by ""dax,"" it leads to ""green."" When ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence following ""lug,"" it corresponds to ""blue.""

Considering the evidence provided and focusing on ""walm,"" a pattern arises where the color repeated three times appears to be influenced by the preceding word. ""Walm"" by itself does not seem to have a consistent color output but may instead signify a repetition of the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning is dependent on the context, specifically the word preceding it, with ""walm"" indicating a repetition of the color denoted by the prior word three times. If no word precedes it that we have a color associated with, ""walm"" defaults to yellow.",0.9,45,walm
"Reviewing the provided examples and outputs, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm.""

- In the first example, when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" 
- In the second example, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" is related to the color yellow when it follows ""zup.""
- In the third example, ""lug walm zup lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue.""
- The fourth example, ""wif bluf dax walm,"" produces ""red red green green green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" has no direct translation to ""green"" in the context of ""dax.""
- The last example, ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm,"" shows that after ""wif"" the sequence ""red red red"" appears, after ""dax"" a single ""green"" appears, and after ""zup"" we expect ""yellow yellow yellow,"" followed by ""lug walm,"" which gives ""blue blue blue.""

From these examples, we can induce the rule that ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Here's the rule based on each preceding word:

- When ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" it outputs ""red red red.""
- When ""zup"" comes before ""walm,"" it outputs ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- When ""lug"" comes before ""walm,"" it outputs ""blue blue blue.""
- When ""dax"" comes before ""walm,"" it outputs a single ""green,"" which seems to be an exception to the pattern of repetition.

Rule: walm -> causes repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it, with ""dax"" being a notable exception where it doesn't repeat, just changes to ""green.""",0.8,45,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", let's look at the pattern of colors output in relation to the input, focusing specifically on occurrences of ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""wif walm zup walm"" outputs ""red red red yellow yellow yellow"". ""Wif"" is followed by triple red, ""zup"" precedes triple yellow. The second ""walm"" also follows a word and is preceded by triple yellow.

- In the second example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". We see the pattern holds for ""zup"" but cannot be certain about ""walm"" as there is no word following it.

- In the third example, ""lug walm zup lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"". Here, ""lug"" precedes and follows a ""walm"" and each time is represented by triple blue. 

- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" outputs ""red red green green green"". ""Wif"" is represented by double red, followed by ""bluf"" which gives double green, and ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and represented as triple green. 

- In the last example, ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" gives ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue"". ""Wif"" before and after ""walm"" gives red, ""dax"" precedes green and ""zup"" precedes yellow.

From these examples, we can infer that ""walm"" causes the color of the word that follows it to be output three times. If ""walm"" is at the end or there is no word following it, it makes the last color to repeat once more. 

Based on this pattern, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule:
- ""walm"" -> causes the next word's associated color to be output three times. If there is no next word, it repeats the last color an additional time.",0.8,45,walm
"From the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word 'walm' affects the output based on the preceding word. Here's a breakdown of the examples:

1. Input: wif walm zup walm

   - 'walm' after 'wif' results in 'red red red'
   - 'walm' after 'zup' results in 'yellow yellow yellow'

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - 'walm' after 'zup' results in 'yellow yellow yellow'

3. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   - 'walm' after 'lug' results in 'blue blue blue'
   - 'walm' after 'zup' results in 'yellow' and is followed by 'lug', which gives 'blue blue blue'

4. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - 'walm' is not directly after any previous words analyzed, so it's assumed 'walm' after 'dax' may result in 'green green green'

5. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   - 'walm' after 'wif' results in 'red red red'
   - 'walm' after 'lug' results in 'blue blue blue'

Given these observations, 'walm' seems to repeat the color associated with the word that comes directly before it three times (two times in the last example, possibly due to a mistake or missing information).

Rule: 'walm' -> meaning. When following a word, 'walm' repeats the associated color of the previous word three times. If the previous word is:
- 'wif', the output is 'red red red'
- 'zup', the output is 'yellow yellow yellow'
- 'lug', the output is 'blue blue blue'

Justification:
In every given example, whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the output includes the word ""green."" It doesn't matter where ""dax"" is positioned in the input; its appearance always corresponds to the addition of ""green"" in the output, suggesting that ""dax"" translates directly to ""green.""
- In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" also translates to ""green.""
- In ""wif zup dax,"" ""dax"" is once again aligned with the output ""green.""
- Similarly, for ""zup dax walm,"" ""dax"" is responsible for one of the ""green"" outputs.
- The pattern continues in ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" where ""dax"" precedes ""green"" in the output.
- Lastly, in ""lug dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output sequence.

Therefore, the rule can be concluded as: dax -> green.",1.0,46,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" translates to the word ""green."" In each instance, the appearance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the appearance of the word ""green"" in the output. Additionally, other words correspond to different colors: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green."" The ""walm"" seems to introduce repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green",1.0,46,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green"" irrespective of its position in the input string or the other words around it. Thus, it seems that the rule for ""dax"" is that it always translates to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,46,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word has a specific color associated with it. Here's the associations according to the input-output pairs:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> red
- walm -> red (this is inferred since ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red"" and we know that ""wif"" is associated with the color red)

Thus, it seems reasonable to deduce that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,46,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Each input containing ""wif"" results in an output containing ""red,"" independent of the position of ""wif"" within the input string and the other words around it.

The correlation for the nonce word ""zup"" appears in each example, and in every instance, the output associated with ""zup"" is ""yellow."" Therefore, the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" in this context is consistent, as it always corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,46,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to observe its role in various example inputs and the corresponding outputs. Let's examine the appearances of ""zup"":

1. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
2. ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
3. ""dax walm zup lug dax"" -> ""green green green yellow blue green""
4. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" -> ""green blue blue blue yellow red""
5. ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red""

From the examples, we can see that:

- In every example where ""zup"" appears, the word directly after ""zup"" in the input (if there is one) is translated to ""red"" in the output. 
- Whenever ""zup"" appears on its own, the output is ""yellow"".
- When ""zup"" appears after other words, ""yellow"" appears only once in the corresponding position to ""zup"" in the output.

Based on the evidence above, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" However, it may also influence the translation of the following word to ""red,"" but only if there is a word following ""zup."" Additionally, this rule does not apply when ""zup"" is the only input.

"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to change the color that follows it into a series of that same color up until a different color is mentioned or the sequence ends. Here is how the rule applies in each example:

1. Input: lug zup walm lug -> Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

First ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, then ""walm"" causes the next word ""lug"" (which would normally mean blue) to repeat the color yellow until the word ""lug"" appears again to end the sequence with blue.

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

""wif"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" turns into blue, ""lug"" is blue. Then ""walm"" causes the next ""dax"" (which would normally be green) to be blue, continuing with blue until ""lug"" ends the sequence with blue.

3. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow

""zup"" is yellow, and ""walm"" repeats the yellow without interruption.

4. Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red

""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" just repeats the red color continuously.

5. Input: zup walm dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

""zup"" is yellow, ""walm"" repeats the yellow, then ""dax"" changes the sequence to green, followed by ""lug"" which ends the sequence with blue.

Rule: walm turns the next mentioned color into a sequence of that color until another color appears or the sequence concludes.

Thus:

walm -> meaning. When ""walm"" follows a color word, it repeats that color word's corresponding color until a different color word is mentioned or the list ends.",1.0,46,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds directly to the color word that precedes it being repeated three times. In all examples provided, ""walm"" causes the color word prior to its occurrence to be outputted three times in succession.

Here are the observations from the examples:

- In the first example, ""lug zup walm lug"", we see that ""lug"", which outputs to ""blue"", is said twice with ""zup walm"" in between, which outputs to ""yellow yellow yellow"". This means ""walm"" likely causes the color before it, which is ""zup"" (yellow), to triple in the output.

- In the second example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"", ""walm"" occurs after ""lug"" and leads to ""blue"" being repeated thrice before ""dax lug"" which is ""green blue"" in the output.

- The third example, ""zup walm"", further supports the rule, as ""zup"" outputs to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated thrice, leading to ""yellow yellow yellow"".

- The fourth example, ""wif walm"", shows the same pattern with ""wif"" leading to ""red"" and ""walm"" causing ""red"" to be repeated three times.

- In the last example, ""zup walm dax lug"", ""zup"" (yellow) is again tripled due to ""walm"", followed by ""dax lug"" which translates to ""green blue"".

Based on the provided examples, the following rule can be induced:

Rule: walm -> Causes the color word immediately before it to be repeated three times in the output.",1.0,46,walm
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of the same color word that follows the word ""zup"" or ""wif"". Here are the observations:

- In the first example, ""lug"" follows ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow"" followed by three ""blue""s which is the same color associated with the word ""lug"".
- In the second example, ""walm"" is followed again by ""lug"", and the output is two additional ""blue""s following the one associated with ""lug"".
- The third example lacks a color word after ""walm"", but since ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the output is three instances of ""yellow"", which is the color associated with ""zup"".
- Similarly, in the fourth example ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output is three ""red""s, which is the color associated with ""wif"".
- Finally, in the last example, ""dax"" follows ""walm"", and the output contains an additional ""green"" which is the color associated with ""dax"".

Therefore:

walm -> Rule: Repeat the color word of the following word three times. If ""walm"" follows ""zup"" then the repeated color is yellow, if ""walm"" follows ""wif"" then the repeated color is red, and so on for other color-associated words.",0.8,46,walm

"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each instance it appears.",1.0,47,lug
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the word ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"".

Reasoning:
- Every instance where ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- ""dax"" stands alone as an input, the output is ""green.""
- ""dax"" occurs within a sequence of other words, but regardless of its position, the word ""green"" appears in the output.

Conclusion:
dax -> green",1.0,47,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" Here are the mappings from the examples:

Example 1:
- dax -> green

Example 2:
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue

Example 3:

"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. There are no exceptions to this pattern in the provided examples.

"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to analyze its association with the output color in each instance. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""wif"" by itself outputs ""red.""
2. ""lug wif walm"" outputs ""blue red red red."" Since ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" and ""walm"" has no introduction, we can assume ""walm"" is repeating the previous color.
3. ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" outputs ""blue red red green blue blue,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" has no precedent and outputs ""green,"" ""dax"" also outputs ""green,"" and the subsequent ""bluf"" repeats the previous ""green"" converted into ""blue.""
4. ""dax walm wif bluf"" outputs ""green green green red red,"" indicating ""dax"" stands for ""green,"" ""walm"" repeats the color, and ""bluf"" with no precedent repeats the last output twice, once as ""red.""

From this analysis, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" represents ""red,"" and when it comes after an unknown word (such as ""walm"" or ""bluf""), it repeats the color it is associated with. 

However, we notice ""wif"" always results in ""red,"" regardless of the words around it. Although some contexts repeat colors, it is always clear for ""wif"" that it turns into ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,47,wif
"Based on the example inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can try to infer the meaning of ""wif"". Here are the outputs categorized by input:

- Whenever the input is just ""wif"", the output is ""red"".
- When ""wif"" is combined with ""lug"" and ""walm"", each occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to a ""red"" in the output. Also, ""lug"" leads to ""blue"", and multiple ""walm"" after ""lug"" without interruption leads to multiple ""red"".
- In the input with ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"", every occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" is ""green"" before ""lug"" changes the color sequence back to ""blue"".
- In the last input ""dax walm wif bluf"", ""dax"" is followed by three ""green"" and ""wif"" then ""bluf"" brings it back to two ""red"".

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". The color for other nonce words seems to be consistent as well, with ""lug"" leading to ""blue"", ""bluf"" leading to ""green"", and ""dax"" leading to ""green"". The repetition of colors in the output seems to be influenced by the surrounding words, but ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".

wif -> red",1.0,47,wif
"Given the examples, it is possible to discern a pattern for the nonce word ""wif"" and its output in different contexts:

- In the first two examples, ""wif"" independently outputs ""red.""
- In the third example, ""lug wif walm"" outputs ""blue red red red,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red"" output following ""blue,"" which likely corresponds to ""lug."" ""Walm"" may correspond to repeating the color that precedes it, duplicating ""red"" in this case.
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" outputs ""blue red red green blue blue,"" with ""wif"" once again corresponding to ""red."" ""Bluf"" may relate to the output ""green,"" ""dax"" appears to correlate with ""green,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue."" ""Bluf"" at the end repeats the preceding ""blue,"" which aligns with the ""walm"" behavior of repeating the preceding color.
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm wif bluf"" produces ""green green green red red,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Again, ""walm"" seems to cause the repetition of ""green,"" and ""bluf"" causes the repetition of ""red.""

Considering these patterns, we can define ""wif"" as consistently corresponding to the output ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,47,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.",1.0,47,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to induce a rule about what ""wif"" means by looking at the output patterns.

Input: wif
Output: red

Input: wif
Output: red

From these two examples, we can see that ""wif"" consistently produces the output ""red"".

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red

In this example, we see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" also corresponds to ""red"", but since ""walm"" appears once and we get three ""red"" in the output, it seems that ""wif"" probably repeats the color that follows it.

Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
Output: blue red red green blue blue

In this example, ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" we get ""red red blue"", reinforcing the idea that ""wif"" might cause the color that follows it to repeat.

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" and the sequence ""walm wif"" produces ""green green"", and then ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"". This suggests that ""wif"" repeats the color of the word that directly follows it.

Using this inductive reasoning, we can formulate a rule:

Rule: ""wif"" -> causes the color corresponding to the following word to be repeated.

"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" every time it is mentioned, regardless of its position in the sequence.

"Observing the provided examples and their respective outputs, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to a sequence of colors in the output. In each instance where ""bluf"" is used, it results in a duplication of the color that immediately precedes it. Here's a breakdown according to the examples:

Rule: bluf -> duplicating the color that corresponds to the immediately preceding word.",1.0,47,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the pattern between the input and the corresponding output. It seems that each word in the input correlates to a specific color in the output. If we assume each input word consistently translates to the same output color and look for the word ""bluf"" in the input and its color representation in the output, we can find the pattern.

Here are the instances of ""bluf"" and the corresponding color outputs:

- dax bluf -> green green
- wif bluf -> red red
- lug bluf -> blue blue
- dax bluf -> green green

By observing the outputs, we can see that ""bluf"" consistently results in an output color that's the same as the preceding word's corresponding color. Hence, based on the examples provided:

Rule: bluf -> The output color for ""bluf"" is the same as the color for the word immediately before it in the sequence.",1.0,47,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns in the inputs and outputs given:

- In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green.""
- In ""zup walm lug wif bluf,"" we see ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" has no direct output (perhaps it has no color association), ""lug"" to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" to ""red red.""
- In ""lug bluf dax bluf,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and the next ""bluf"" again to ""green.""
- In ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""bluf"" is green again, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" again is ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""
- In ""dax bluf wif zup lug,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""bluf"" is green again, ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""

From the above patterns, it seems ""bluf"" is not associated with a consistent color; instead, its output changes depending on its position or the word that precedes it. 

Looking specifically at patterns involving ""bluf,"" it seems that ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the word that comes before it:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output color is ""green green.""
- In the third example, it follows ""lug"" first and then ""dax,"" producing ""blue, green,"" which are the respective colors of ""lug"" and ""dax."" 
- In the fourth and fifth examples, the pattern holds: after ""dax,"" ""bluf"" leads to ""green green,"" and after ""lug,"" it results in ""blue blue.""

Hence, it seems that:

Rule: ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word that precedes it.",0.9,47,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's consider its position in relation to other words and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax bluf

2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

Here, ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red"" following ""blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" again results in the repetition of a previously mentioned color.

3. Input: lug bluf dax bluf
   Output: blue blue green green

In this instance, ""bluf"" appears after ""lug"" and then after ""dax,"" each time resulting in two consecutive colors (""blue blue"" and ""green green"").

4. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
   Output: blue green green yellow blue red

Here, ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"" and the result is a repeated color, ""green.""

5. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug

Based on these examples, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word. So the rule is:

   ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" here and results in two reds, then a green follows ""dax"", and ""zup"" yields a yellow.

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" and produces two reds.

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. The color sequence continues uninterrupted until a new word comes into play that changes the sequence. In the fifth example, the presence of ""zup wif"" before ""walm"" results in ""yellow red red red"" indicating that ""walm"" is directly influencing the repeat of the color red, which corresponds to ""wif.""

Walm -> meaning. Walm causes the repetition of the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input sequence, the output color of the word just before ""walm"" is repeated once.",1.0,47,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it until a new word is introduced. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""dax walm wif dax,"" the word after ""walm"" is ""wif."" ""Dax"" corresponds to green, and from the use of ""walm,"" the color green repeats until ""wif"" is encountered. Since ""wif"" corresponds to red, the pattern changes after that.
- In the second example, ""lug walm dax,"" the word ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" causes blue to repeat until ""dax"" is encountered, at which point the color changes to green.
- Similarly, in the other examples, ""walm"" causes the repeating of the color of the word that comes right before it, until a new word appears.

So, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it repeats the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word until a new word appears.",1.0,47,walm
"To discern the meaning of ""walm"" from the given examples, we need to analyze the pattern of how it affects the corresponding output.

Example 1:
Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green
- The presence of ""walm"" seems to be associated with a series of ""green,"" until a different word breaks the sequence.

Example 2:
Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
- Again, ""walm"" initiates a sequence of ""blue,"" but the appearance of ""dax"" changes the output to ""green.""

Example 3:
Input: wif dax lug walm
Output: red green blue blue blue
- ""walm"" at the end of the sequence results in ""blue"" repeating.

Example 4:
Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- ""walm"" after ""wif"" leads to the continuation of ""red.""

Example 5:
Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- Following ""wif,"" ""walm"" results in additional ""red.""

From these examples, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> causes the next output color(s) to repeat the color of the preceding word until a different word appears.",1.0,47,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the examples provided.

From the first example:

- Input: dax walm wif dax
- Output: green green green red green

Every instance of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" except when it follows ""walm,"" where it turns ""red.""

From the second example:

- Input: lug walm dax
- Output: blue blue blue green

""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" but after ""walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" not its usual ""green.""

From the third example:

- Input: wif dax lug walm
- Output: red green blue blue blue

""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Notice ""walm"" at the end, yielding a string of ""blue.""

From the fourth example:

- Input: wif walm dax zup
- Output: red red red green yellow

""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" After ""walm,"" ""dax"" becomes ""green.""

From the fifth example:

- Input: zup wif walm
- Output: yellow red red red

""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" After ""walm,"" there is a string of ""red.""

From these patterns, we can derive that ""walm"" changes the color output to the color that is associated with the word that immediately follows ""walm."" If ""walm"" is at the end, it repeats the output color associated with the word that precedes it.

Thus, the rule is:

Rule: walm -> Changes the color output to the color associated with the word following it, or if it's at the end, repeats the color of the preceding word.",0.9,47,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples and find a pattern:

1. **Input:** dax walm wif dax
   **Output:** green green green red green
   
   Here, ""dax"" appears twice and maps to green both times, except when it immediately follows ""walm,"" where it maps to red.

2. **Input:** lug walm dax
   **Output:** blue blue blue green
   
   ""lug"" maps to blue, and then ""walm"" doesn't change this pattern until ""dax,"" which maps to green after ""walm.""

3. **Input:** wif dax lug walm
   **Output:** red green blue blue blue
   
   ""wif"" maps to red, then ""dax"" maps to green, followed by ""lug"" which maps to blue. After ""walm,"" the color does not change, so it remains blue.

4. **Input:** wif walm dax zup
   **Output:** red red red green yellow
   
   ""wif"" maps to red consistently, then comes ""walm,"" and the next color is green, which is different from previous reds. ""zup"" maps to yellow following ""dax.""

5. **Input:** zup wif walm
   **Output:** yellow red red red
   
   ""zup"" maps to yellow, ""wif"" maps to red, and after ""walm,"" the color stays red.

Based on the above observations, the rule seems to be:
- ""walm"" causes the color of the immediately following word to change from whatever the previous word's color was. However, if the previous and the following words are the same, it changes to the color that word would not normally map to.

Therefore, we can deduce the meaning or rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> causes the next word to change its usual color output, unless paired with a word that has already been assigned a color, in which case it changes to the alternate color.",0.8,47,walm

"Based on the given examples, it seems that every time the nonce word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. We see this is consistent across all provided inputs with the word ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

"Based on the given examples, wif corresponds to the color red.

Thus, the rule is: wif -> red.",1.0,48,wif
"Based on the given examples, each input word correlates to a specific output color. For instance, ""bluf"" consistently outputs ""green,"" ""dax"" outputs ""green,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,48,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red"" in the output, regardless of context or the words surrounding it. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,48,wif
"From analyzing the examples provided, we can infer the meaning of the nonce word ""wif."" Each sentence is a series of nonce words followed by a series of colors. By examining which colors correspond to ""wif"" in each sentence, we can induce its meaning.

In all the examples, whenever the word ""wif"" is mentioned, the corresponding output is the color ""red."" Therefore, regardless of its position in a sequence or the words that precede or follow it, ""wif"" consistently correlates with the color ""red.""

Based on this pattern, we can deduce the following:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,48,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following:

- In the first example, ""dax zup lug"" translates to ""green yellow blue."" Therefore, we may infer that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" This leaves ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow."" Here, ""wif"" likely corresponds to ""red,"" confirming our earlier inference that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" translates to ""red yellow yellow red green."" We have already matched ""wif"" with ""red"" and ""dax"" with ""green,"" so ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"" remains consistent. We can ignore ""bluf"" for the purpose of determining the meaning of ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue."" Our previous inferences about ""dax"" being ""green,"" ""wif"" being ""red,"" and ""lug"" being ""blue"" again leave ""zup"" consistently translating to ""yellow.""
- The fifth example gives us ""zup"" translating directly to ""yellow,"" further strengthening our inference.

From these observations, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is consistent throughout all examples.

"Walm -> meaning. Rule: walm causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes just before it, three times.

For instance:

- In ""lug wif walm"", the color before walm is red (from wif), so walm translates to three reds.
- In ""dax walm zup"", the color before walm is green (from dax), leading to walm becoming three greens followed by the color corresponding to zup, which is yellow.
- In ""dax lug walm"", the color before walm is blue (from lug), so walm results in three blues.
- In ""wif walm dax zup"", the color before walm is red (from wif), making walm turn into three reds followed by the respective colors of dax and zup, which are green and yellow.",1.0,48,walm
"Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" appears to result in the output of the color word that corresponds to the preceding word being repeated multiple times. Specifically, it looks like ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color three more times (considering the output already includes the color corresponding to the word before ""walm""). For the examples:

- ""lug zup dax walm"" translates to ""blue yellow green green green,"" so ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three additional times after ""dax.""
- ""lug wif walm"" becomes ""blue red red red,"" so ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three additional times after ""wif.""
- ""dax walm zup"" yields ""green green green yellow,"" so ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three additional times and is then followed by ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup.""
- ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue,"" with ""walm"" repeating ""blue"" three additional times after ""lug.""
- ""wif walm dax zup"" turns out to be ""red red red green yellow,"" with ""walm"" causing ""red"" to repeat three additional times after ""wif.""

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule for the word ""walm"" is that it causes the color indicated by the word right before it to be outputted an additional three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three more times.",1.0,48,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Here's how the rule is deduced from the examples:

1. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""dax"" to green. After ""dax"", ""walm"" appears, resulting in ""green"" being repeated in the output.

2. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red. After ""wif"", ""walm"" appears, resulting in ""red"" being repeated in the output.

3. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green. After ""dax"", ""walm"" appears, resulting in ""green"" being repeated before the next color, ""yellow"", which corresponds to ""zup"".

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" to blue. After ""lug"", ""walm"" appears, resulting in ""blue"" being repeated in the output.

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red. After ""wif"", ""walm"" appears, resulting in ""red"" being repeated before the next colors ""green"" and ""yellow"", which correspond to ""dax"" and ""zup"" respectively.

Rule: walm -> a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,48,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the consistent aspect of the outputs whenever ""walm"" is used in the input.

1. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green
2. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
3. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow
4. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
5. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow

Looking at the input-output relationships involving ""walm"":

- In every instance where ""walm"" is used, the number of words in the output exceeds the number of words in the input.
- Following the appearance of ""walm"" in the input, the output repeats the color corresponding to the word that comes before ""walm"" in the input, and does so for as many times as there are total words before ""walm"".

Let's analyze:

- In (1), ""lug zup dax walm"" -> ""green"" is the color of ""dax,"" and ""green"" is repeated three times because there are three words before ""walm.""
- In (2), ""lug wif walm"" -> ""red"" is the color of ""wif,"" and ""red"" is repeated twice because there are two words before ""walm.""
- In (3), ""dax walm zup"" -> ""green"" is the color of ""dax,"" and ""green"" is repeated once because there is one word before ""walm.""
- In (4), ""dax lug walm"" -> ""blue"" is the color of ""lug,"" and ""blue"" is repeated twice because there are two words before ""walm.""
- In (5), ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red"" is the color of ""wif,"" and ""red"" is repeated three times because there are three words before ""walm.""

So the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

walm -> The color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated as many times as the total number of words that come before ""walm.""

Rule: Repeat the color of the word before ""walm"" based on the count of words preceding ""walm.""",1.0,48,walm
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,49,lug
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,49,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue.""",1.0,49,lug

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in all given examples.",1.0,49,lug

"dax -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, ""dax"" seems to correspond to the color ""green.""

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, the output is ""green"" for that instance. This rule, however, does not explain the entire output, as there are other words (""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup"") that correspond to other colors, which are not specifically asked to be defined in this problem. Each word most likely represents a different color based on a consistent mapping.",1.0,49,dax
"dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of position or context within the sequence of words.",1.0,49,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" However, there is also a pattern that suggests that other words correspond to different colors, and ""dax"" seems to repeat the color pattern specified by the preceding words when it appears multiple times.

Here are some patterns observed:
- ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green.""
- ""lug"" appears to correspond to the color ""blue.""
- ""walm"" seems to correspond to multiple ""green"" outputs.
- ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red.""
- ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow.""

With these patterns in mind, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule:
- ""dax"" -> green
- The output colors repeat in the order introduced in the input, beginning with ""green"" when ""dax"" is encountered, and continuing through the pattern established by other words until ""dax"" appears again, at which point the sequence restarts with ""green."" Each word including ""dax"" seems to have a specific color assigned.",0.9,49,dax
"Rule: wif -> red

The given examples consistently associate the nonce word ""wif"" with the output ""red."" Therefore, it can be deduced that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the given context.",1.0,49,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""wif"" appears, it translates to the color ""red"" in the output.",1.0,49,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,49,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" seems to correspond to the color ""red."" However, in the sequence ""wif bluf dax,"" the output for ""wif"" is ""red,"" but for the second ""bluf,"" the output is not ""blue"" (as might be expected from the other examples) but ""red"" again, followed by ""green"" for ""dax.""

Noting this pattern, let's look at the third example: ""lug walm wif lug bluf."" The two instances of ""lug"" both map to ""blue,"" and the ""wif"" between them maps to ""red."" Additionally, the final ""bluf"" in this sequence maps to ""blue,"" which suggests that the first instance of a color word in a sequence may affect the color assigned to subsequent words, at least until a new color word appears.

From the fourth example: ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" we see that repeated ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" and ""dax"" map to ""yellow"" again. The appearance of ""wif"" changes the output to ""red"" for ""wif"" and the next ""bluf"" word.

The last example again supports the ""red"" mapping for ""wif"" and shows that ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""dax"" is green after ""wif.""

The consistent mapping for ""wif"" across all examples (no matter the context in which ""wif"" is used) suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" each time it appears, without depending on position or neighboring words.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,49,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,49,wif
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's analyze the provided inputs and their corresponding outputs by breaking down each example and examining the patterns.

1. Input: wif zup  ->  Output: red yellow
2. Input: wif zup  ->  Output: red yellow
3. Input: dax zup bluf  ->  Output: green yellow yellow
4. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax  ->  Output: yellow yellow red blue green
5. Input: lug zup wif lug  ->  Output: blue yellow red blue

From examples 1 and 2, we notice that ""wif zup"" consistently leads to ""red yellow,"" indicating that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

In example 3, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and based on our previous deduction, ""zup"" maintains its correspondence to ""yellow.""

In example 4, the output order is the same as the input order. Matching them directly gives us the following associations:
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" -> ""yellow""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""dax"" -> ""green""

Example 5 also follows the same pattern with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and again, ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Based on this analysis, the rule deduced is:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,49,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" we'll look at the inputs and their corresponding outputs systematically:

1. Input: ""wif zup"" 
   Output: ""red yellow""
   
   Here ""zup"" follows ""wif,"" and the output ""yellow"" follows ""red.""

2. Input: ""wif zup""
   Output: ""red yellow""
   
   The same input and output are observed. ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" once again.

3. Input: ""dax zup bluf""
   Output: ""green yellow yellow""
   
   The appearance of ""zup"" comes after ""dax"" and before ""bluf,"" and ""yellow"" appears after ""green"" and before the second ""yellow."" 

4. Input: ""zup bluf wif lug dax""
   Output: ""yellow yellow red blue green""
   
   ""zup"" appears at the start of the sequence here, leading us to believe that its position does not affect its meaning, as ""yellow"" is still the first word in the output.

5. Input: ""lug zup wif lug""
   Output: ""blue yellow red blue""
   
   Again, ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow,"" independent of its position, as it is between ""lug"" and ""wif"" here.

Rule: Regardless of the position of ""zup"" within the input sequence, the corresponding output is ""yellow."" 

Therefore, zup means yellow. 

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,49,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that zup corresponds to the color yellow consistently. Each time zup is used within an input, the output includes the word ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is: 
zup -> yellow.",1.0,49,zup
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" In each instance where ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

The rule can be written as:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" is used in the input, it translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,49,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word in the inputs corresponds to a specific color in the outputs. The same input words consistently lead to the same outputs colors. Notice that each occurrence of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. 

There are multiple occurrences of other words, such as ""wif,"" which maps to ""red,"" and ""lug,"" which maps to ""blue."" Since ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence, we can infer that ""zup"" refers to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,49,zup
"Based on the given examples, we want to determine the rule for the nonce word ""bluf."" Each non-nonce word seems to translate to a color, and ""bluf"" appears to yield different colors in different contexts. Let's examine the examples to identify a pattern:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" becomes ""green green"". From this, we might infer that ""bluf"" means ""green"" when following ""dax,"" but we need more evidence.

- In the second example, each instance of ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The word ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" once and translates to ""green,"" just like in the first example, but it also follows ""wif"" once and translates to ""yellow,"" which breaks the initial rule we thought of.

- In the third example, ""lug"" becomes ""blue"" and ""walm"" becomes ""blue,"" while ""dax"" is consistently ""green."" Here, ""bluf"" appears twice: it follows ""wif"" to produce ""red"" and it follows ""dax"" to produce ""red."" It seems ""bluf"" does not mean ""green"" and ""red"" consistently after ""wif"" and ""dax,"" as previously observed.

- In the fourth example, ""lug zup bluf dax"" is translated to ""blue yellow yellow green."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow"" and the corresponding output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""

- In the fifth example, ""zup lug bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue blue"" and ""zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow red."" Thus, in both instances where ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it translates to ""yellow.""

Now let's try to derive a rule:

The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding non-nonce word:
- If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the result is ""green.""
- If ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the result is ""red.""
- If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the result is ""yellow.""
- If ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the result is ""blue.""
- If ""walm"" precedes ""bluf,"" the result is the color corresponding to ""walm,"" but there's insufficient data to determine what that color is (although it could be ""blue"" as shown in the third example).

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" reflects the color of the immediately preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the immediate preceding word.",1.0,49,bluf
"Analyzing the patterns in the given examples:

Input: dax bluf | Output: green green  
- ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", indicating that ""bluf"" might mean ""green"" since ""dax"" also translates to ""green.""

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf | Output: red green yellow red green green
- ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"" again and results in ""green"" as the output once more. Notice that each word seems to correspond to a unique color: ""wif"" to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax | Output: green blue blue blue green red red green  
- Here ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and translates to ""red"", demonstrating that ""bluf"" does not consistently mean ""green"" but might take on a specific color depending on the word it follows.

Input: lug zup bluf dax | Output: blue yellow yellow green  
- Following ""zup"", ""bluf"" results in ""yellow."" This reinforces the notion that ""bluf"" assumes the color of the word preceding it.

Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif | Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red  
- Once again, ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word: after ""lug"" it becomes ""blue"", and after ""zup"" it becomes ""yellow.""

Rule:
Given the consistent pattern across examples where ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"" as follows:

bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" adopts the color corresponding to the word immediately before it in the sequence.",1.0,49,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns corresponding to its usage:

1. When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""
2. When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
3. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" or ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""

It appears that ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately before it. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: If a word X precedes ""bluf,"" the output is the color associated with X repeated twice.",0.9,49,bluf
"To deduce the rule for ""bluf,"" we can look at each instance where the word is used and the corresponding output:

1. dax bluf -> green green (bluf follows dax, and the color after dax is green)
2. wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> red green yellow red green green (bluf follows dax again, which is green)
3. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green (bluf follows wif, and the color after wif is red)
4. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green (bluf follows zup, and the color after zup is yellow)
5. zup lug bluf zup bluf wif -> yellow blue blue yellow yellow red (bluf follows zup which is yellow then follows zup again and the color after zup is yellow)

Based on these examples, we can see that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is mentioned after the word that is immediately before ""bluf"". 

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word following the word that it follows.",0.8,49,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to discern the rule governing the instances of the nonce word ""bluf"". Let's review the examples and their outcomes to identify any patterns:

1. dax bluf -> green green
2. wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> red green yellow red green green
3. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green
4. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green
5. zup lug bluf zup bluf wif -> yellow blue blue yellow yellow red

In each of these examples, let's see if we can define ""bluf"" based on the colors it produces:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" generates green when preceded by ""dax"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" still generates green when preceded by ""dax"", even though there are other words between the two instances of ""dax"".
- In the third example, ""bluf"" produces red when it follows ""wif"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" generates yellow when it comes after ""zup"".
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" generates blue when it comes after ""lug"" and yellow again when it comes after ""zup"".

Based on the patterns observed in the data, ""bluf"" seems to depend on the word immediately preceding it:

- When preceded by ""dax"", the output for ""bluf"" is green.
- When preceded by ""lug"", the output for ""bluf"" is blue.
- When preceded by ""zup"", the output for ""bluf"" is yellow.
- When preceded by ""wif"", the output for ""bluf"" is red.

Rule: bluf -> The meaning of ""bluf"" changes to a color based on the word immediately before it. The specific rules for the examples given are as follows:
- ""dax bluf"" results in ""green"".
- ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue"".
- ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow"".
- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red"".",0.8,49,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we'll look at its placement and the output colors in each example:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" and the output color is green, while the colors before and after are yellow and red, corresponding to ""zup"" and ""wif"" respectively.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" is again followed by ""dax"" giving us green, with ""wif"" both before and after ""walm dax,"" represented by red.
3. In the third example, ""walm"" appears twice. The first instance is followed by ""dax"" and again yields green; the second ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of three blue, related to ""lug.""
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" and the output is three times blue, the same color as ""lug"" in the previous example.
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup,"" both instances producing three colors—green and yellow, associated with ""dax"" and ""zup,"" respectively.

From this, we can observe that ""walm"" seems to cause the next word to output thrice, with the color tied to that next word. So, ""walm"" appears to mean ""repeat the next color three times.""

Rule: walm -> repeat the next color three times.",1.0,49,walm
"Based on the examples where ""walm"" appears and the subsequent color outputs, it seems that ""walm"" commands the repetition of the color output that immediately precedes it, until the next unique word appears. It functions like ""repeat the last color.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last color output until a new unique word appears.",1.0,49,walm
"walm -> repeat the color of the last word

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" is encountered, repeat the color associated with the previous word in the sequence.",1.0,49,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" signals a repetition or continuation of the color associated with the word that precedes it. More specifically, when the word ""walm"" appears, the output is a series of the same color that corresponds to the word right before ""walm"". The number of times the color is repeated corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" is used consecutively. When ""walm"" is no longer used consecutively, the color pattern shifts according to the next word.

Here's the breakdown of the rules based on the provided examples:

- In all instances, ""walm"" follows another word that can be associated with a specific color: ""zup"" yields yellow, ""dax"" yields green, ""wif"" yields red, and ""lug"" yields blue.
- ""Walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be outputted multiple times. The number of repetitions matches the number of ""walm"" uses.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Rule: Repeat the color associated with the previous word, for as many times as ""walm"" appears in succession.",0.9,49,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at the consistency of the pattern with respect to its appearance in the input and its corresponding output.

From the examples provided, we can observe the following patterns:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the output is a repetition of three colors corresponding to the following word.
- The colors that ""walm"" generate are dependent on the word that follows ""walm.""

Here is a breakdown of the instances:
- Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
    - ""walm dax"" generates ""yellow yellow yellow""
- Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green
    - ""walm dax"" generates ""red red red""
- Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
    - ""walm dax"" generates ""red red red""
    - ""lug walm"" generates ""blue blue blue""
- Input: lug walm zup wif -> Output: blue blue blue yellow red
    - ""lug walm zup"" generates ""blue blue blue yellow""
- Input: dax walm zup walm -> Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
    - ""dax walm"" generates ""green green green""
    - ""zup walm"" generates ""yellow yellow yellow""

Based on this, it seems that ""walm"" acts as a modifier that repeats the color associated with the next word three times. Additionally, the color that follows a standalone word (not preceded by ""walm"") is not repeated. 

For instance:
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" 

Knowing this, our rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" precedes a word, it generates an output of that word's corresponding color repeated three times.

Therefore, the deduction would be written as:

walm -> When preceding a word, it causes the color associated with the next word to be repeated three times in the output.",0.8,49,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,50,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the outputs provided.",1.0,50,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".",1.0,50,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,50,lug
lug -> blue,1.0,50,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at how it affects the output in all given examples. 

1. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
2. ""dax zup dax zup"" -> ""green yellow green yellow""
3. ""zup dax lug"" -> ""yellow green blue""
4. ""dax lug bluf"" -> ""green blue blue""
5. ""lug dax wif lug"" -> ""blue green red blue""

Based on these examples, ""dax"" always maps to ""green"" regardless of its position in the string. We can see that every time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the exact same position in the output.

The rule is then:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,50,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's compare the outputs when ""dax"" is present to when it is not:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output is ""green.""
- The other words in the input (""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" ""wif"") correspond to different colors in the output: ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""red.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""dax"" directly translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the list.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,50,dax
"Based on the examples provided, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" Here is the reasoning:

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

In this example, ""dax"" is the first word, and it correlates with ""green,"" the first word in the output. ""Lug"" and ""walm"" appear to be ""blue.""

Input: dax zup dax zup
Output: green yellow green yellow

Here, ""dax"" appears twice and is translated to ""green"" both times. ""Zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""

Input: zup dax lug
Output: yellow green blue

In this instance, ""dax"" is the second word and aligns with the second color ""green"" in the output sequence.

Input: dax lug bluf
Output: green blue blue

Again, ""dax"" is the first word and corresponds to ""green."" ""Lug"" is assumed to be ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" also correlates with blue but seems to be irrelevant in determining the color associated with ""dax.""

Input: lug dax wif lug
Output: blue green red blue

In this series, ""dax"" is the second word and translates to ""green,"" consistent with the previous examples. ""Lug"" appears twice and is ""blue"" each time, and ""wif"" is ""red.""

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,50,dax
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we should look for a pattern of the word and its corresponding output in various examples. 

Here are the instances of ""dax"" and their outputs:

1. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
2. ""dax zup dax zup"" -> ""green yellow green yellow""
3. ""zup dax lug"" -> ""yellow green blue""
4. ""dax lug bluf"" -> ""green blue blue""
5. ""lug dax wif lug"" -> ""blue green red blue""

In example 1, ""dax"" appears at the beginning and the corresponding color is ""green.""

In example 2, ""dax"" appears at the beginning and in the middle, corresponding to ""green"" in both instances.

In example 3, ""dax"" is in the middle and corresponds to ""green.""

In example 4, ""dax"" is at the beginning again, corresponding to ""green.""

In example 5, ""dax"" is in the middle and corresponds to ""green"" once more.

In all instances, the appearance of ""dax"" leads to the word ""green"" in the output. It seems consistent that no matter where ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is always ""green"" for ""dax.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""dax"" can be written as:
Rule: dax -> green",1.0,50,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the correlation between the inputs and outputs:

1. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
2. dax zup dax zup -> green yellow green yellow
3. zup dax lug -> yellow green blue
4. dax lug bluf -> green blue blue
5. lug dax wif lug -> blue green red blue

From the given examples, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" It does not change with context; the word ""dax"" is always associated with the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,50,dax
"Based on the examples given, it seems that the word ""wif"" translates directly to the color ""red."" Each time the word ""wif"" appears in an input, the word ""red"" correspondingly appears in the output. Here is the breakdown:

- ""wif lug dax"" translates to ""red blue green,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue,"" where ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax walm wif zup"" translates to ""green green green red yellow,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""zup wif dax"" translates to ""yellow red green,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

So, the rule we can induce is:

wif -> red.",1.0,50,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif"", we'll analyze the given examples and outputs systematically. For simplicity, we'll pair each input with its corresponding output.

1. Input: wif lug dax — Output: red blue green
2. Input: lug wif — Output: blue red
3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug — Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
4. Input: dax walm wif zup — Output: green green green red yellow
5. Input: zup wif dax — Output: yellow red green

We'll look for instances where ""wif"" appears and see what outputs correspond to its position:

- Example 1, ""wif"" is followed by ""lug dax,"" which corresponds to ""red blue green."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green"" based on latter inputs' outputs, ""wif"" likely correlates to ""red.""
- Example 2, ""wif"" comes after ""lug,"" and the output sequence is ""blue red."" Since we know ""lug"" gives us ""blue,"" it reinforces that ""wif"" gives us ""red.""
- Example 3, ""wif"" precedes ""zup bluf lug walm dax lug,"" and the output sequence starts with ""red,"" with other colors following corresponding to the additional inputs. This also supports ""wif"" translating to ""red.""
- Example 4, ""wif"" is preceded by ""dax walm"" (green, green) and followed by ""zup"" (yellow), and the output sequence ""green green green red yellow"" places ""red"" right after the two greens and just before ""yellow."" Again, this suggests ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- Example 5, ""wif"" is flanked by ""zup"" and ""dax,"" with the output being ""yellow red green."" Since ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" fits in as ""red.""

Across all examples, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" Therefore, based on the given examples, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,50,wif
"Based on the given input and output pairs, we can induce that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" This is because every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. Let's examine each example:

- In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" in the output.
- In the second example, which contains ""wif"" without ""lug,"" ""red"" still follows in the output.
- In the third example, ""wif"" appears once and is followed by ""red"" in the output, despite the presence of other words that map to other colors, such as ""lug"" to ""blue"".
- The fourth and fifth examples further support this pattern as ""wif"" maps to ""red"" regardless of its position among other words.

Following this pattern, we can write:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,50,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,50,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Here's how the translation appears to work based on the input and output pairs provided:

Input: wif lug dax
Output: red blue green
(Here, ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""dax"" with ""green."")

Input: lug wif
Output: blue red
(""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""wif"" follows as ""red."")

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
(""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" is also ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""walm"" doesn't have a direct single color translation but appears to denote a repetition of the color that follows it, ""dax"" is ""green,"" and then ""lug"" again translates to ""blue."")

Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow
(""dax"" is ""green,"" ""walm"" indicates a repetition of ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."")

Input: zup wif dax
Output: yellow red green
(""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""dax"" is ""green."")

Based on these observations, the rule for ""wif"" is:
Rule: wif -> red",1.0,50,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's analyze the examples provided in conjunction with the outputs. 

- When ""zup"" appears alone, the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" is paired with ""wif,"" the output has ""yellow"" before ""red.""
- When in a sequence as in ""zup bluf wif,"" ""yellow"" precedes the other colors without considering the position of ""zup.""
- The presence of ""zup"" with ""walm"" results in three ""yellow"" in the output, the same as the input length.
- When ""zup"" is in a sequence with other words, there is always a ""yellow"" in the output corresponding to ""zup.""

Based on these observations, we can induce that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the other words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,50,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" each time it appears.",1.0,50,zup
"zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in every example provided.",1.0,50,zup
"zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,50,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

- Each time the word ""zup"" appears, the output includes ""yellow"".
- The word ""zup"" does not depend on its position in the input sequence to be translated to ""yellow"".

Hence, the rule we can induce from the examples is:

Rule: zup -> yellow. The meaning of ""zup"" is ""yellow"" regardless of its position in a sequence.",1.0,50,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" functions as a duplicator or repeater of the preceding word's associated color. Here's the pattern deduced from the input and output pairs:

- ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red"", suggesting ""wif"" means ""red"" and ""bluf"" repeats it.
- ""lug bluf"" becomes ""blue blue"", suggesting ""lug"" means ""blue"" and ""bluf"" repeats it.
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" includes a new word ""walm"". Considering the output ""red red red blue blue,"" it's reasonable to conclude that ""walm"" means ""red"" as well, and ""bluf"" repeats the last color mentioned, thus ""walm"" is red (like ""wif""), and ""lug"" is blue, each repeated by ""bluf"".

Therefore, the general rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" is:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the associated color of the immediately preceding word.",1.0,50,bluf
"bluf -> ""repeat the color word that precedes it"". 

Rule: When the word bluf follows a color word like ""wif"" or ""lug"", the output is that color word repeated twice. ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" based on the provided examples.",1.0,50,bluf

"bluf -> repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Rule: When a word appears before ""bluf,"" it is translated to its corresponding color, and this color word is then repeated.

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" has an effect on the words that immediately follow it. Specifically, it appears to repeat the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. For instance, in the first example, ""wif"" translates to the color red, and after ""walm"" is used, we see three reds in a row. In the third example, ""zup"" correlates to yellow, and the output is three yellows after ""walm"" without any other words in between.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: walm -> replaces the following words with the color associated with the word that directly precedes it, repeating that color for the number of words replaced.",1.0,50,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to correspond to repeated color output matching the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it. Specifically, ""walm"" seems to induce repetition of the color that maps to the word before ""walm."" For instance:

- ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" the output is three times ""red.""
- ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" the output is three times ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it acts as a repetitive modifier for the color indicated by the preceding word, causing the output to repeat that color thrice.

Rule: walm -> Causes the preceding color to be repeated three times in the output.",1.0,50,walm
"From the provided examples, we can observe a pattern that allows us to discern the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"". Here are the observations from each example:

1. Example: ""zup wif walm lug""
   Output: ""yellow red red red blue""
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red""
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
   - The presence of ""walm"" turns the following ""lug"" into ""red"" instead of its usual ""blue"".

2. Example: ""dax wif walm""
   Output: ""green red red red""
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green""
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red""
   - The word ""walm"" appears to enforce the color ""red"" after its occurrence.

3. Example: ""zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
   - The word ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""yellow"" instead of the introduction of a new color.

4. Example: ""wif walm lug bluf""
   Output: ""red red red blue blue""
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" likely translates to ""blue""
   - ""lug"" usually is ""blue"" but turns ""red"" instead after ""walm"".

5. Example: ""lug walm""
   Output: ""blue blue blue""
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
   - The occurrence of ""walm"" induces a repetition of ""blue"" instead of a change of color.

1. ""zup wif walm lug"" turns into ""yellow red red red blue"": Here, ""walm"" precedes ""lug"" and the output for ""lug"" is ""red"" three times followed by the regular ""blue"" for the word ""lug.""

2. ""dax wif walm"" becomes ""green red red red"": Again, ""walm"" precedes nothing in this case, but ""wif"" turns to ""red"" three times.

3. ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"": Here, ""walm"" doesn't have a word after it. It just triples the output which corresponds to ""zup"" which is ""yellow.""

4. ""wif walm lug bluf"" is ""red red red blue blue"": ""Walm"" comes after ""wif"" and results in ""wif"" being ""red"" three times followed by the regular sequence for ""lug"" and ""bluf.""

5. ""lug walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue"": Similar to example 3, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output for ""lug"" is repeated three times.

From these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to repeat three times (if ""walm"" follows a word), or ""walm"" causes its own color to triple if it stands alone without a following word.

- When ""dax"" appears before ""bluf,"" which doesn't have an independent translation in the examples, the output is ""green green,"" reinforcing that ""dax"" could mean ""green.""
- When ""wif dax bluf"" appears, the output is ""red green green,"" where ""wif"" (if it follows the pattern) translates to ""red"" and ""dax"" remains ""green.""
- Finally, ""dax zup walm wif"" results in ""green yellow yellow yellow red,"" where ""dax"" is once again ""green,"" ""zup"" and ""walm"" probably translate to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is consistent as ""red.""

Thus, the induction based on these examples suggests the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green.",0.9,51,dax
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,51,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates consistently to the color ""red."" Each time the word ""wif"" is an input, the output is ""red."" 

The output for other words (""bluf,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax"") also corresponds to colors (""blue,"" ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""green"" respectively), suggesting that each nonce word maps to a specific color.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,51,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,51,wif
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" Therefore, no matter the context in which ""wif"" appears, the output remains unchanged. 

Thus, the rule can be stated as:

wif -> red",1.0,51,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the given outputs, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,51,wif
"Looking at the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or the rule for the nonce word ""zup"". Each example includes an input with one or more occurrences of ""zup"" and an output where ""zup"" is replaced with a color. Here's the analysis:

1. Input: wif zup lug zup lug
   Output: red yellow blue yellow blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" directly.

2. Input: wif zup dax
   Output: red yellow green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" directly.

3. Input: zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" directly.

4. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" directly.

5. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" directly.

Therefore, based on the examples, the rule for ""zup"" is consistent:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Meaning ""zup"" means ""yellow"" in the given context.",1.0,51,zup
"Based on the examples given:

- When ""zup"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" stands alone or starts the input, the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" follows ""lug"" or ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow.""

In every case, regardless of the preceding word, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,51,zup
"Analyzing the provided examples, here is a breakdown of each one:

1. Input: wif zup lug zup lug
   Output: red yellow blue yellow blue

2. Input: wif zup dax
   Output: red yellow green

3. Input: zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue

4. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green

5. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Let's focus on what we know about the other words:

- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"".
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"".
- ""walm"" when placed after zup, or a word that turns into yellow gives ""yellow"".

With those translations established, let's look at where ""zup"" appears and its corresponding output:

- When ""zup"" is followed by ""lug"" or ""dax"", the output is ""yellow"" followed by the respective outputs of ""lug"" and ""dax"" (""blue"" and ""green"", respectively).
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which does not occur in any other input, the output is ""yellow yellow blue"". We don't have enough information to decode ""bluf,"" but given that the first ""yellow"" corresponds to ""zup,"" we might infer that ""bluf"" might also correspond to ""yellow,"" but this is only a hypothesis, not a robust rule.
- When ""zup"" is between ""lug"" or ""walm,"" it consistently translates to ""yellow"".

Given the consistent translation of ""zup"" across all examples regardless of position or surrounding context, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,51,zup
"Rule: The word ""zup"" means ""yellow"" when translated. Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output.

zup -> yellow.",1.0,51,zup
"Based on the examples provided, each use of ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" There does not appear to be any contextual variation that would change the meaning of ""zup"" in the given examples; it is consistently translated to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the list or the surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,51,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to relate to the word that immediately precedes it, which determines the color to be repeated in the output.

Here is my analysis:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, and the next word is also ""yellow"".
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output, and the next word is also ""green"".
- When ""wif"" precedes ""dax"" which precedes ""bluf"", it results in ""red green green"", so irrespective of ""wif"" being before ""dax"", the word ""bluf"" still causes the color corresponding to ""dax"" to be repeated.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeat the color that corresponds to the word that comes directly before ""bluf"".",1.0,51,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color named directly before it. Here's the evidence supporting this rule:

- In ""wif dax zup bluf"", ""zup"" which means yellow is immediately before ""bluf"", and the output is yellow for both ""zup"" and ""bluf"".
- In ""zup bluf"", ""zup"" means yellow and is followed by ""bluf"", and the output is yellow for both.
- In ""dax bluf"", ""dax"" means green and is followed by ""bluf"", and the output is green for both.
- In ""wif dax bluf"", ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"" and both output green.
- In ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"", ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", which means green; hence, ""bluf"" also outputs green immediately after ""dax"".

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,51,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" is associated with the repetition of the color word that directly precedes it. When ""bluf"" follows a word, it means to repeat the color translation of the preceding word.

Rule: If a word translates to a color and is followed by ""bluf,"" then the output is the color corresponding to that word, repeated once. For example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" so ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" Similarly, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" so ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green.""",1.0,51,bluf
Rule: bluf translates to the color associated with the immediately preceding word.,1.0,51,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the preceding word. 

Therefore:
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is yellow (zup -> yellow, bluf -> yellow).
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is green (dax -> green, bluf -> green).
- When ""wif"" precedes ""dax"" which in turn precedes ""bluf,"" the color is still green as ""dax"" was the last word before ""bluf.""

Hence, bluf -> color of the preceding word.",1.0,51,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze how its presence affects the output compared to the other words in the examples.

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
Here ""walm"" appears to result in the word ""blue.""

Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow
Here ""walm"" again appears to result in the word ""green,"" which is the same color that ""dax"" corresponds to.

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red
In this case, ""walm"" results in the word ""red.""

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Here ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue,"" which is the same as ""lug.""

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue
In this example, ""walm"" corresponds to ""green,"" the same as ""dax.""

From the examples, it appears that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word immediately before it:

- In the first example, ""lug"" is before ""walm"" and both translate to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" is before ""walm"" and both result in ""green.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" is before ""walm"" and both translate to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" again, with both being ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" once more, with both yielding ""green.""

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: walm -> The color word that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. If ""walm"" is the first word, there isn't an example to infer from.",1.0,51,walm
"Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the last mentioned color.

Explanation:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue,"" which suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" (which is ""blue"").
- In the second example, ""dax walm wif"" corresponds to ""green green green,"" meaning ""walm"" here repeats ""dax"" (which is ""green"").
- In the third example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red,"" where ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif"" (which is ""red"").
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm wif"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" again repeats the color of ""lug"" (which is ""blue"").
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm lug"" yields ""green green green,"" where ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"" (which is ""green"").

Thus, walm -> repeats the last mentioned color.",1.0,51,walm
"Analyzing the given examples:

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue

Now let's analyze the contexts where 'walm' appears:

1. walm appears after the word 'lug' and the color blue is repeated.
2. 'dax' is followed by 'walm' and green is repeated.
3. 'wif' follows 'walm' and red is repeated.
4. 'walm' occurs after 'lug' once more, and the color blue is repeated.
5. 'dax' is before 'walm' again, with green repeated just after.

From these observations, it seems that 'walm' causes the color that immediately precedes it to be repeated in the output sequence. It's a kind of duplication rule.

Rule: walm -> Duplicates the color of the preceding word in the output sequence.",1.0,51,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" examine each input to see the effect of ""walm"" on the corresponding output.

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue **blue** blue yellow red
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in the same output color as ""lug,"" which is blue.

Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green **green** green red yellow
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and gives the same output color as ""dax,"" which is green.

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red **red** red
- In this example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in the same output color as ""wif,"" which is red.

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue **blue** blue red blue blue
- ""Walm"" comes after ""lug"" here and takes the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green **green** green blue
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and again the output is the same color as the ""dax.""

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" results in the same color as the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: walm -> the same color as the word that comes before it in the sequence.",1.0,51,walm
"To find the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the examples provided:

1. In the first sequence, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and translates to ""blue,"" which is the same color that ""lug"" translates to.
2. In the second sequence, ""walm"" is surrounded by ""dax"" and ""wif,"" which both translate to ""green.""
3. In the third sequence, after the original ""dax lug"" (green blue) combination, ""wif walm"" both translate to ""red.""
4. In the fourth sequence, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and translates to ""blue"" again, while ""wif lug"" translates to ""blue blue.""
5. In the fifth sequence, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and translates to ""green,"" the same as ""dax.""

Looking at these patterns, it seems that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. If it follows ""dax,"" it becomes ""green,"" if it follows ""lug,"" it becomes ""blue,"" and if it follows ""wif,"" it becomes ""red."" There are no examples with ""zup"" or ""bluf"" preceding ""walm,"" so we have no data on what color it might take in those cases.

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,51,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue regardless of context within the examples provided.",1.0,52,lug
"Observing the examples provided, it becomes apparent that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue."" There is no variation in the output when ""lug"" is present in the input, regardless of the other words accompanying it. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,52,lug
"Based on the examples provided:

- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue.""
- When ""lug"" is combined with other nonce words (""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""dax""), different color words (""red,"" ""yellow,"" ""green"") are outputted in addition to ""blue,"" and the order of the colors corresponds to the order of the nonce words in the input. 

This suggests that each nonce word is mapped to a specific color. From the given information, we can deduce the following mappings:

Rule:
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green",1.0,52,lug
"Based on the examples provided, lug translates to blue every time it appears in input. 

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,52,lug
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following meanings:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow

"wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in every given instance.",1.0,52,wif

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,52,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word wif seems to consistently translate to the color red. This is shown by every instance where the word ""wif"" appears, the Output corresponding directly to it is ""red.""

"zup -> meaning. Based on the provided examples where the word ""zup"" consistently leads to the output ""yellow,"" and does so regardless of context (i.e., whether it is surrounded by other words or not), the rule appears to be:

Rule: zup means yellow.",1.0,52,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position or the context within the sequence of words.",1.0,52,zup

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position or the other words present in the input sequence.",1.0,52,zup
"Based on the given examples, it is possible to induce the following rule:

When adjacent to the word ""wif"" (red), ""bluf"" translates to ""red."" When adjacent to any other word, ""bluf"" translates to the color that corresponds to the previous word.

However, looking more closely at the examples:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" (blue) and translates to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" (green) and translates to ""green.""
- In the third and fifth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red) and translates to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and translates to ""yellow.""

From this pattern, we can induce that ""bluf"" translates to the same color as the word that follows it, except in cases where ""bluf"" is directly after ""wif,"" where it translates to ""red.""

Thus, the rule is:

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""red."" When ""bluf"" follows any other word, or is at the start of an input sequence, it translates to the same color as that of the word that follows it.

So the induction for ""bluf"" would be:

bluf -> the same color as the next word, unless it follows ""wif,"" then it means red.",1.0,52,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,0.4,52,bluf

"Walm -> repeat the color of the previous word multiple times.

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word right before it. The number of repetitions appears to increase by one each time it is used in a sequence. For example, if ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which signifies ""yellow,"" it causes the output to be ""yellow"" repeated one more time than it was previously. If ""walm"" is used again, it causes ""yellow"" to be repeated two more times than the previous, and so on. The repetitions are reset when a new color word is introduced before ""walm.""",1.0,52,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" appears to replicate the color associated with the preceding word for a number of times equal to the number of letters in that word. 

For example:

- ""zup walm"" -> ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" and since ""zup"" has three letters, the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- ""lug walm"" -> ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and since ""lug"" has three letters, the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
- ""dax walm"" -> ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and since ""dax"" has three letters, the output is ""green"" repeated three times.

When ""walm"" is preceded by multiple words, it seems to only consider the immediately preceding word for its replication rule.

walm -> The repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word, with the number of repetitions equal to the number of letters in that word.",1.0,52,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns in each example:

1. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
2. ""zup lug walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue""
3. ""dax zup dax walm"" -> ""green yellow green green green""
4. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red green""
5. ""dax walm wif dax"" -> ""green green green red green""

The output contains a repetition of colors, and each segment of repetition appears to relate to the words in the input. Focusing on ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""walm"" produces three repetitions of yellow, which corresponds to the preceding ""zup.""
- In the second example, ""lug walm"" produces four repetitions of blue, with ""lug"" appearing to correspond to the color blue.
- In the third example, ""dax walm"" produces four repetitions of green, with ""dax"" appearing to correspond to the color green.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" precedes the colors but still follows the pattern of ""lug"" corresponding to blue and ""dax"" corresponding to green.
- In the fifth example, again ""dax walm"" corresponds to three repetitions of green, consistent with ""dax"" leading to the color green.

It seems that ""walm"" acts as a multiplier for the preceding color word (nonce word) in the inputs. The number of repetitions of a color in the output corresponds to the number of non-color words in the input before ""walm."" Additionally, ""wif"" introduces a single instance of red followed by a single instance of the color associated with the last nonce word.

Rule: ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to repeat in the output a number of times equal to the total number of preceding words. 

walm -> repeater of the color associated with the preceding nonce word, number of repetitions is equal to the count of preceding words.",0.9,52,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to add an output sequence that corresponds to the sequence of colors represented by the words immediately preceding it. The color corresponding to each word seems to be:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- wif -> red

In every output where ""walm"" is used, the sequence of colors preceding ""walm"" is repeated. Let's review the examples:

1. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""walm"" takes the color represented by ""zup"" (yellow) and repeats it twice, totaling three iterations of the same color.

2. Input: zup lug walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" repeats the sequence ""yellow blue"" (from ""zup lug"") two more times, making it four times the initial sequence.

3. Input: dax zup dax walm -> Output: green yellow green green green
   - ""walm"" repeats the sequence ""green yellow green"" (from ""dax zup dax"") once more, totalling two iterations of the sequence.

4. Input: zup lug walm wif dax -> Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   - ""walm"" repeats the sequence ""yellow blue"" (from ""zup lug"") two more times with an additional ""red green"" sequence at the end (from ""wif dax"").

5. Input: dax walm wif dax -> Output: green green green red green
   - ""walm"" repeats the color ""green"" (from ""dax"") two more times with an additional ""red green"" sequence at the end (from ""wif dax"").

Thus, the general rule can be summarized as the word ""walm"" repeats the sequence of colors that comes before it, with ""wif"" and any subsequent word adding a new sequence of colors after the repetition.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the sequence of colors represented by the words that come before it. If ""wif"" or any other word follows ""walm"", continue the sequence from there with the additional color or colors.",0.8,52,walm

"The examples suggest a correspondence between the nonce word ""wif"" and specific colors. Also, other words like ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" seem to correspond to colors. 

Let's look at each example in turn to deduce the meaning of ""wif"":

- In the first example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green."" It's not immediately clear what ""wif"" means, but we note that ""bluf"" corresponds to red and ""walm"" corresponds to green.

- In the second example, ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" translates to ""red green red red yellow red."" Here ""wif"" is consistently translated to red. However, ""dax"" corresponds to green in this case, ""bluf"" to red again, and ""zup"" to yellow.

- In the third example, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""blue red green green red blue."" Here ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" again to red, ""dax"" again to green, and ""bluf"" also to green.

- In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" corresponds to red and ""walm"" corresponds to red, which conflicts with the first example where ""walm"" corresponds to green. However, the consistency of the output color for ""wif"" seems to support that ""wif"" means red.

- In the fifth example, ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue."" This confirms that ""lug"" corresponds to blue and suggests that ""wif"" again corresponds to red.

From the available information, ""wif"" consistently translates to red in every example. Therefore, it seems that the rule for ""wif"" is that it corresponds to the color red.

wif -> red

_rule: ""wif"" translates to the color red._",1.0,53,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can see that ""wif"" consistently maps to the color ""red"" in the output. The pattern is as follows:

Input: wif bluf dax walm 
Output: red red green green green 
- Here, ""wif"" translates to ""red"". 

Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif 
Output: red green red red yellow red 
- Here, each occurrence of ""wif"" translates to ""red"".

Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug 
Output: blue red green green red blue 
- Here, the appearance of ""wif"" is again associated with the color ""red"".

Input: wif walm 
Output: red red red 
- Here, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and both translate to ""red"". 

Input: wif lug 
Output: red blue 
- Here, ""wif"" translates to ""red"" while ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".

Thus, the rule for the word ""wif"" seems consistent and is not dependent on the context of other words within the input. The rule for ""wif"" is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,53,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red."" Each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output, irrespective of the position in the sequence or the presence of other words.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, it translates to ""red"" in the output.",1.0,53,wif
"From the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to a color in the output, and its association seems to change based on context. Let's examine the mappings:

- When ""wif"" appears before ""bluf"" or ""dax"", the output is ""red red"" or ""red green"", respectively. This suggests that the first ""wif"" maps to ""red"".
- When ""wif"" appears before ""walm"", the output is ""red red red"", suggesting that in this context, ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" also maps to ""red"".
- Looking at ""wif"" followed by different words (""lug"", ""zup""), ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red"".
- When ""wif"" directly follows ""dax"" or ""bluf"", its corresponding output is ""red"" no matter what.
- The second word in the input after ""wif"" seems to correspond to the color it maps to in the output. For instance, ""lug"" maps to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""bluf"" to ""red"", ""walm"" to ""green"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

Based on the above observations, it appears that ""wif"" acts as a prefix that doesn't change the color in the output but rather indicates that a color name will follow. Since the color after ""wif"" in the inputs is consistently translated to that color in the output, without a change in the color, the rule we can deduce is as follows:

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""wif"" indicates the presence of a color name that follows, and the color is presented as is in the output.",0.8,53,wif
"Rule: zup -> yellow

This rule indicates that the word ""zup"" is translated to or is synonymous with the word ""yellow"" in the outputs provided. Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context within the sequence of other words.",1.0,53,zup

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" means ""yellow"" regardless of the context in which it appears.",1.0,53,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Explanation: Each occurrence of the word 'zup' in the inputs is translated to 'yellow' in the corresponding outputs, regardless of its position in the sequence. This consistent translation indicates that 'zup' means 'yellow'.",1.0,53,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"", regardless of the context in which it appears.",1.0,53,zup
"bluf -> blue

Rule: 'bluf' translates to the color blue regardless of the context in which it's used.",1.0,53,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the output is always a color, and the color that is outputted corresponds to the input word before ""bluf"". Each input word seems to be associated with a specific color:

- ""lug"" is associated with blue.
- ""dax"" is associated with green.
- ""wif"" does not seem to have a pair in the examples, but based on the third example, where ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" outputs ""blue red red blue red"", it seems ""wif"" is associated with red.
- ""zup"" is associated with yellow.

Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word preceding it. If there is no word before ""bluf"", no color is repeated (as seen in the second example where ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow"", ""zup"" being the first word).

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word. If ""bluf"" is preceded by:
- ""lug"", the output is blue.
- ""dax"", the output is green.
- ""wif"", the output is red.
- ""zup"", the output is yellow.",1.0,53,bluf
"bluf -> repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: When bluf follows another color word, repeat that color. If bluf starts the sequence or does not follow a recognized color word, there is not enough information to determine what color bluf represents.",1.0,53,bluf
"Based on the examples given, the word ""bluf"" seems to adapt its meaning to match the color associated with the word that comes before it. For instance, when ""lug"" which is associated with the color blue comes before ""bluf"", the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue"". Similarly, when ""dax"" which translates to green is followed by ""bluf"", ""bluf"" also means ""green"". Therefore, ""bluf"" reflects the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.",1.0,53,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Bluf means to repeat the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: When the word bluf appears after another word, the output is the color corresponding to the previous word repeated. For example, after ""lug"" (which corresponds to blue), bluf results in ""blue blue""; after ""dax"" (which corresponds to green), bluf gives ""green green""; after ""wif"" (which corresponds to red), bluf produces ""red red""; and after ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow), bluf makes ""yellow yellow"".",1.0,53,bluf
"Analyzing the input-output pairs:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green 
   
   - 'wif' leads to 'red'
   - 'bluf' leads to another 'red'
   - 'dax' leads to a single 'green'
   - Following 'walm', there are two additional 'green' instances.

2. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   
   - 'wif' leads to 'red'
   - 'dax' leads to 'green'
   - 'zup' leads to a single 'yellow'
   - Following 'walm', there are two additional 'yellow' instances.

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   
   - 'zup' leads to 'yellow'
   - 'wif' leads to 'red'
   - Following 'walm', there are two additional 'red' instances.

4. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   
   - 'wif' leads to 'red'

5. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   
   - 'wif' leads to 'red'
   - 'lug' leads to 'blue'
   - Following 'walm', there is one additional 'blue' instance.

From the examples, one can induce that the word 'walm' causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated twice more.

Therefore, the rule is:
walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word two more times.

Rule: walm duplicates the color corresponding to the word that comes directly before it, resulting in two more occurrences of that color.",1.0,53,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the outputs corresponding to each input.

- In each instance of ""walm,"" the output changes to a repeating color.
- The number of repeated colors after ""walm"" seems to depend on the number of words following ""walm.""
- The repeated color is the color that would be ordinarily assigned to the word that immediately precedes ""walm.""

Let's check the consistency of this pattern:

1. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> outputs ""red red green green green."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and there are two words after ""walm,"" hence three ""green"" in the output.

2. ""wif dax zup walm"" -> outputs ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" corresponds to yellow, and there are two words after ""walm,"" resulting in three ""yellow"" in the output.

3. ""zup wif walm"" -> outputs ""yellow red red red."" ""Wif"" corresponds to red, and there is one word after ""walm,"" so there are two ""red"" in the output.

4. ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> outputs ""red red red blue blue."" After ""walm"" there are two words, so we see two repeated colors, ""red,"" corresponding to ""wif,"" which is before ""walm.""

5. ""wif lug walm"" -> outputs ""red blue blue blue."" After ""walm"" there is one word, so we see two ""blue,"" matching the color of ""lug"" before ""walm.""

Based on this analysis, the meaning of ""walm"" appears to act as a duplicator of the color corresponding to the word that precedes it, repeated for the number of words that follow.

Rule: walm -> A rule that duplicates the color associated with the word just before ""walm,"" repeating it for the count of words that come after ""walm.""",1.0,53,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I will analyze the association of the word with the colors in the output.

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the colors go from ""green"" to three ""green"" in a row.
- In the second example, ""walm"" succeeds ""zup,"" and the output shifts from ""yellow"" to three ""yellow"" in a row.
- In the third example, ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" and the output changes from ""red"" to three ""red"" in succession.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" and the output alters from ""red"" to three ""red"" followed by two ""blue"" (possibly because ""bluf"" follows ""walm"").
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output switches from ""blue"" to three ""blue"" in a row.

From these examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the preceding color to repeat three times. It seems to amplify or extend the output of the color word that comes right before it. Therefore, based on the given context:

Rule: walm -> ""Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.""",0.9,53,walm
"Observing the patterns:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

2. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   
3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   
4. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   
5. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue

When breaking down the examples, here are the observable patterns that associate the input with the output:

- The word ""wif"" is consistently followed by a single ""red"".
- The word ""bluf"" is followed by two ""blue"".
- The word ""dax"" is followed by two ""green"".
- The word ""lug"" is followed by two ""blue"".
- The word ""zup"" appears to be followed by three ""yellow"".
- The nonce word ""walm"" occurs at different positions in the input.

The repeat pattern following the nonce word ""walm"" suggests that ""walm"" means repeat the color that comes after the word preceding ""walm"".

Based on these observations:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""walm"".

Rule:
- If ""walm"" follows ""wif"", repeat ""red"".
- If ""walm"" follows ""bluf"", repeat ""blue"".
- If ""walm"" follows ""dax"", repeat ""green"".
- If ""walm"" follows ""lug"", repeat ""blue"".
- If ""walm"" follows ""zup"", repeat ""yellow"".",0.9,53,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let us examine the corresponding output for each color following the appearance of the word in the input:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - Following ""walm"" are three green outputs.

2. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   - Following ""walm"" are three yellow outputs.

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - Following ""walm"" are three red outputs.

4. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   - Following ""walm"" are two blue and one more red outputs.

5. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   - Following ""walm"" are three blue outputs.
   
From these examples, we observe that ""walm"" is consistently followed by a repetition of the last color mentioned three times, except for the fourth example where ""walm"" precedes a red and then two instances of blue, possibly an exception due to the presence of another color word following ""walm."" Ignoring the fourth input due to its inconsistency with the pattern observed in other examples, we can infer:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Causes the last mentioned color to be repeated three times.

Using this rule, we can predict that if ""wif"" corresponds to red, then following ""wif walm"" the output should be ""red red red,"" which is an observation supported by the third and fifth inputs. However, as the fourth example introduces potential variability, if additional context or examples are provided, the rule may need further refinement. Thus:

walm -> Causes the last mentioned color to be repeated three times in the sequence that follows.",0.8,53,walm
"lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in all given examples.",1.0,54,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in the output. No matter the position of ""lug"" in the input sequence or the context provided by the surrounding words, the output for ""lug"" remains the same.

lug -> blue",1.0,54,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, consistently across each example provided.",1.0,54,lug
"lug -> blue

"Based on the examples, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue."" Each instance of ""lug"" in the inputs corresponds directly to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the other words present. Therefore, the rule for ""lug"" appears to be independent of context within the given examples.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,54,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color output. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input string or the words around it.

Thus, the rule can be articulated as:

Rule: dax -> green. ""Dax"" always means the color green.",1.0,54,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,54,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""dax"" can be deduced by looking at the consistent output each time the word ""dax"" is presented.

- In the first example, the input ""dax"" results in the output ""green.""
- In the second example, ""zup walm dax"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow green."" Here, it seems that each word before ""dax"" is producing ""yellow"" and ""dax"" itself produces ""green.""
- In the third example, ""lug dax zup dax wif"" produces ""blue green yellow green red."" Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" regardless of its position.
- The fourth example, ""wif dax zup wif,"" leads to ""red green yellow red."" Once again, we see ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- Lastly, ""dax lug"" results in ""green blue,"" with ""dax"" being ""green.""

Considering these examples, the meaning of ""dax"" is consistent and independent of its position within the sequence of words. Therefore, the rule can be formulated as:

1. ""zup lug dax zup walm"" translates to ""yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" and so ""walm"" also translates to ""yellow.""

2. ""zup walm dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue."" In this sequence, ""walm"" again follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" resulting in ""walm"" translating to ""yellow.""

3. ""zup dax lug walm zup"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" so ""walm"" translates to ""blue.""

4. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" In this sequence, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which is ""red,"" so ""walm"" translates to ""red.""

5. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" In this sequence, ""walm"" again follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" resulting in ""walm"" also translating to ""yellow.""

Rule:

Example: If ""walm"" follows the word that translates to ""red,"" then ""walm"" means ""red."" If ""walm"" follows the word that translates to ""blue,"" then ""walm"" means ""blue,"" and so on.",1.0,54,walm
"Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word before ""walm"" as many times as ""walm"" appears in the sequence. 

Explanation: In each instance where ""walm"" is used, the output color is repeated as many times as the word ""walm"" appears and it is the same color as the word that appears just before the first occurrence of ""walm"". 

Examples:
- In the first input, ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow"") comes before ""walm"", and ""walm"" appears once. Therefore, the output is ""yellow"" repeated once (""yellow yellow yellow"").
- In the second input, ""zup"" (yellow) comes before ""walm"" and there's only one ""walm"", hence the two ""yellow""s in the output.
- In the third input, ""lug"" (blue) comes before ""walm"", and as ""walm"" appears only once, we only have one repetition of ""blue"" at the place where ""walm"" is.
- In the fourth input, ""wif"" (red) comes before ""walm"", ""walm"" appears once and so the output color ""red"" is repeated once (three reds for the three contiguous ""wif walm"").
- In the fifth input, ""zup"" (yellow) comes before ""walm"" and since there's one ""walm"", it is repeated once in the output.",1.0,54,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can try to induce the rules governing the conversion from the input strings to the respective color outputs. Let's inspect how the word ""walm"" affects the transformation:

1. In the first example, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"". We notice that ""zup"" on its own corresponds to ""yellow"", so it seems that ""walm"" is some modifier that extends or replicates the color preceding it.

2. In the second example, we see ""zup walm dax lug"", which translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue"". Here again, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and we see a repeated ""yellow"".

3. In the third example, ""lug walm zup"" becomes ""blue blue blue yellow"", suggesting that the ""walm"" follows the same pattern as previous examples by repeating the color which comes before it.

4. In the fourth example, ""wif walm lug"" translates to ""red red red blue"". This confirms that ""walm"" is consistently repeating the color before it.

5. In the fifth example, ""zup walm"" simply becomes ""yellow yellow yellow"", without any additional inputs to consider.

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> a rule that causes the color of the word preceding it to be repeated twice more.

So, functionality-wise, ""walm"" causes repetition or extension of the previous color descriptor, effectively tripling it.",1.0,54,walm
"Considering the examples provided, each instance of ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color output that directly follows ""zup"". So, after a ""zup"" there is a color, and ""walm"" repeats that same color however many times necessary until there is a color that is not yellow or until another ""zup"" defines a new color to repeat.

Let's look at the examples to see the pattern:

1. ""zup walm"" translates directly to ""yellow yellow yellow"". Since ""zup"" translates to yellow, ""walm"" means repeat the color associated with ""zup"".
2. ""zup lug dax zup walm"" translates to ""yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"". After the second ""zup"", the ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""zup"", which is yellow.
3. In ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"", the ""walm"" repeats the color after ""wif,"" which is red, until another color (""lug"" -> blue) appears.

This being said, the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> Repeat the color that follows ""zup"" until a different color appears or a new ""zup"" command is given.

Rule: Repeat the preceding ""zup"" command's color.",0.9,54,walm
"Based on the examples given, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond with repeating the color output that came immediately before it. Here is the breakdown:

In the first example, ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"" and is followed by ""walm"" which also results in ""yellow"".
In the second example, we don't have an immediate precedent before the first ""walm"", yet it repeats ""yellow"" which is what ""zup"" corresponds to. Then it repeats ""yellow"" two more times.
In the third example, ""lug"" maps to ""blue"" and is immediately followed by ""walm"" which results in ""blue"". Then ""zup"" repeats the cycle with additional ""blues"".
In the fourth example, we can see that ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which maps to ""red"", and ""walm"" yields multiple ""reds"".
In the fifth example, ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"" and is followed by ""walm"" which also yields ""yellow"".

5. The word ""walm"" following ""dax"" still results in ""green,"" indicating that ""dax"" likely does not change meanings based on adjacent words.
6. Word orders and combinations change, but whenever ""dax"" is present, its corresponding output is always ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input.

Based on the observations made from the examples, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green,"" regardless of its position or the context in the input sequence.

Therefore, we can deduce that:

dax -> green.",1.0,55,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

From the examples provided, each instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green."" Therefore, we can deduce that in this context, ""dax"" means green.",1.0,55,dax
"Upon examining the instances provided, it is evident that the word 'dax' invariably corresponds to a consistent output color, namely 'green'. The other words in the examples appear to correlate with varying output colors. As for 'zup', it seems consistently linked with the color 'yellow', independent of its position in the input sequence.

Therefore, based on the information given, we can infer the following correlation:

Rule:
- dax -> green",1.0,55,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look for patterns corresponding to the input and output of each example.

- In the first input-output pair ""dax walm zup"" -> ""green green green yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green.""
- The second input-output pair ""zup dax"" -> ""yellow green"" again has ""dax"" corresponding to ""green.""
- The third pair ""dax lug zup"" -> ""green blue yellow,"" has ""dax"" corresponding to the first ""green.""
- The fourth pair ""zup dax walm zup wif"" -> ""yellow green green green yellow red,"" we see ""dax"" as the second word, which corresponds to the second ""green.""
- The fifth pair ""dax wif"" -> ""green red,"" ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green.""

From these examples, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds directly to the color ""green"" in the outputs regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,55,dax
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,55,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. 

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,55,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" consistently, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Thus, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,55,wif
"Based on the examples given, each instance of the nonce word ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red."" There are no contexts provided in which ""wif"" yields a different color or any sort of variation. Therefore, we can induce that ""wif"" directly correlates to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,55,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color red each time it appears in the input. Hence, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,55,wif
"By analyzing the input examples and their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to establish a pattern that defines the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""zup.""

Let's examine the occurrences of ""zup"":

- wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug → red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
- dax bluf wif zup wif → green green red yellow red
- zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup → yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
- zup wif lug wif → yellow red blue red
- dax walm zup lug → green green green yellow blue

We can see a pattern in which the word ""zup"" always corresponds to the output ""yellow."" There does not seem to be any additional context affecting this outcome. Therefore, the meaning of ""zup"" based on the provided examples is consistent and unchanged regardless of its position within the input sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,55,zup
"To deduce the meaning or rule for the word ""zup,"" let's examine its corresponding outputs in all the examples.

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" also corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in both instances it appears.
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" again.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

In all cases, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,55,zup
"Based on the examples provided, zup corresponds to the color yellow. Thus:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word zup translates to the color yellow when converted from the input to the output.",1.0,55,zup
"Based on the presented examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to a color. Specifically, it seems that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" This can be determined by looking at the consistent output of ""yellow"" whenever ""zup"" appears in the input.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,55,zup
"Based on the given examples, each appearance of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, the rule for the word ""zup"" can be defined as:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,55,zup
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" seems to mean ""repeat the color word that comes immediately before it."" In each example, the color word that comes before ""bluf"" is simply repeated in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> repeat the preceding color word.",1.0,55,bluf
"Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" appears to be the same as the word preceding it. The output for ""bluf"" is a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes just before it.

- In the first example, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" following it also translates to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" again, leading to a ""red"" translation.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" also gives us ""green.""

Thus, the rule seems to be:
bluf -> meaning. The meaning is the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,55,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" directly translates to the color that precedes it. In each example, ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it, and then repeats it. 

For instance:

- In the first example, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" so ""bluf"" also means ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" also means ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" means repeat the color that comes before it.",1.0,55,bluf
"Observing the provided examples, we can deduce the following correlations:

- Every time ""wif"" appears, it is translated to ""red.""
- Every time ""dax"" appears, it is translated to ""green.""
- Every time ""lug"" appears, it is translated to ""blue.""
- The occurrences of ""bluf"" result in a repeated output of the color that precedes it.
- The presence of ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" is not explicitly shown to correspond to a color, but following the pattern in the third example provided, where it repeats the color of ""dax"", which is ""green,"" it would be reasonable to expect ""walm"" to also follow the rule that ""bluf"" sets, meaning it repeats ""green.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" -> When ""bluf"" appears in the sequence, it duplicates the color associated with the immediately preceding word. For example, if ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" the output for ""bluf"" will also be ""red."" If it follows ""dax,"" resulting in ""green,"" then ""bluf"" becomes ""green"" as well. If ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" will be ""blue.""",1.0,55,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" means repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Example application of the rule:
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, so ""bluf"" causes it to be repeated: red red.
- In ""lug bluf,"" ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, so ""bluf"" causes it to be repeated: blue blue.",1.0,55,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond to the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it in the input sequence. However, it not only takes the color of the preceding word but also appears to triple the output for that color. 

To deduce this, let's look at the sequences:

- In sequence 1, ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" and the output triples the color yellow, which is the output for ""zup"".
- In sequence 2, ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" and the output triples the color green, which is the output for ""dax"".
- In sequence 3, ""walm"" follows both ""zup"" and ""dax"" at different points. After ""zup,"" the color yellow is tripled; after ""dax,"" the color green is tripled.
- In sequence 4, ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" and the output is red tripled.
- In sequence 5, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and green is tripled in the output.

So the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word three times in the output. 

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,55,walm
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be that it outputs the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, repeated three times.

Here's the breakdown:

- Whenever ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" three times.
- Whenever ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" three times.
- Whenever ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" three times.

So the rule seems to be:

walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word preceding ""walm"" three times. 

Rule: If the preceding word is ""zup,"" the color is yellow. If the preceding word is ""dax,"" the color is green. If the preceding word is ""wif,"" the color is red.",1.0,55,walm
"walm -> meaning. Based on provided input and output examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" results in repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it thrice. 

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, the color corresponding to that preceding word is repeated three times.",1.0,55,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the meaning of the word ""walm"" is linked to the preceding word. When ""walm"" follows different words, the output color is repeated the same number of times as the color associated with the preceding word. Here's the breakdown:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times (since ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"").
2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" repeated three times (since ""dax"" translates to ""green"").
3. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" repeated three times (since ""wif"" translates to ""red"").

Thus, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" takes on the color of the preceding word and repeats it the same number of times as specified by that color. 

So the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,55,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to influence the color that follows it, causing repetition of that color. Let's analyze each example:

1. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""
   - ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" (yellow) and before ""dax"" (green). The color yellow is repeated three times after ""walm"".

2. ""zup wif dax walm"" -> ""yellow red green green green""
   - Here, ""walm"" precedes ""dax"" (green), and the color green is repeated three times.

3. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" -> ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red""
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) causing yellow to repeat twice but since there is ""wif walm"" at the end which yields ""red red red,"" the rule could involve repeating the previous color three times.

4. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), and the color red is replicated three times.

5. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), and green is replicated three times.

From these observations, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to cause the previous color to repeat a total of three times, including the initial occurrence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color a total of three times.",1.0,55,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Each instance where ""lug"" is present corresponds to the color blue appearing in the output. Other words such as ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax"" seem to correspond to different colors, namely ""red,"" ""yellow,"" and ""green,"" respectively. ""Walm"" is repeated in the output as ""blue,"" however, it occurs with ""lug,"" so it could either be a repetition of ""lug"" or have its own color. Without a distinct example of ""walm"" without ""lug,"" we cannot be certain of its standalone meaning.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,56,lug
"Based on the given examples, the word 'lug' consistently translates to 'blue' regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it. Therefore, the most straightforward rule we can induce from the given data is that the word 'lug' corresponds to the color 'blue'.

"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in every example provided.",1.0,56,lug

In each instance where ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the same position.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,56,wif

2. zup wif -> yellow red
3. lug wif dax wif -> blue red green red
4. lug zup wif lug -> blue yellow red blue
5. wif dax -> red green

Now let's look for patterns:

- In every instance where ""wif"" appears, it is followed by ""red"" in the output.
- The word that comes after ""wif"" does not seem to influence the resulting color, as ""wif"" is followed by different words (""bluf"", ""dax"", ""lug"", and so on) but still results in ""red"".
- ""wif"" itself never maps to a color other than ""red"" across all examples provided.

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""wif"" consistently maps to the color ""red"", regardless of its position or the words that come before or after it in the input.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,56,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"":

- In every instance where ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"".
- ""Wif"" does not appear to change meaning based on position or surrounding words.

Given these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,56,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word in the input corresponds to a particular color in the output. By comparing the outputs with their associated inputs, we can discern the following:

- ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green.""
- ""zup"" is consistently associated with ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" in the single instance it is used.

Given this information, it seems ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to correspond to a sequence of a specific color that is repeated three times. To determine the exact meaning of ""walm,"" we can look at the color sequences provided in the output for different inputs that include ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" is associated with the color blue when preceded by ""lug.""
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" also shows a threefold repetition, this time of the color red.
- In the third example, ""wif walm"" is associated with three reds, reinforcing the idea shown in the second example.
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""zup walm"" and ""walm"" on its own correspond to three yellows, indicating that when ""walm"" follows ""zup"" or stands alone, it is associated with the color yellow.

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" modifies the preceding word and invariably results in three occurrences of a particular color. The specific color appears to be determined by the word that comes before ""walm."" If ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the color is blue; if ""wif"" precedes it, the color is red; and if ""zup"" precedes it or if ""walm"" appears alone, the color is yellow.

Rule:
walm -> a rule resulting in the output of the same color word three times, with the specific color determined by the preceding word or ""walm"" being alone, resulting in yellow.",1.0,56,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of a word being repeated three times. Here is the breakdown:

1. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".
2. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"".
3. ""walm zup"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"".
4. ""dax lug wif walm"" lead to the sequence ""green blue red red red"" where ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red"".
5. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" similarly to example 3, but in reverse order.

The word that comes before ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output. Notice that there is no example with ""walm"" at the start not followed by another word to understand what it would do on its own. However, ""walm"" seems to act as a multiplier for the word that precedes it.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the preceding word three times.",1.0,56,walm
"By examining the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"".

In the first example, ""lug walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"". We see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". Hence, ""walm"" may be adding one additional ""blue"" to the sequence.

In the second example, ""wif walm zup"" converts to ""red red red yellow"". ""Wif"" equates to ""red"" and ""zup"" still represents ""yellow"". Again ""walm"" seems to add two more ""red"".

In the third example, ""dax lug wif walm"" translates to ""green blue red red red"". ""Dax"" means ""green"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""wif"" is ""red"". Once more, ""walm"" is adding two extra ""red"" to the sequence.

In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow"". Given that ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""walm"" seems to add two more ""yellow"".

In the final example, ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red"". ""Wif"" means ""red"", and it seems that ""walm"" is adding two additional ""red"".

Based on these observations, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color word preceding it two more times, effectively extending the color sequence by two.

Rule: walm -> repeats the previous color word two additional times.",1.0,56,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will compare the inputs and their respective outputs to identify patterns. Each word seems to correspond to a color, with ""lug"" corresponding to blue, ""wif"" to red, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""dax"" to green. The word ""walm"" appears to modify the sequence of colors that follow it.

Here's the analysis of each input-output pair:

1. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   Here, after the first ""lug,"" which is blue, the sequence ""walm zup"" adds a yellow before continuing with blue again. After the second ""lug,"" ""walm"" seems to cause the pattern to repeat starting with blue.

2. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   ""Wif"" corresponds to red, and the ""walm zup"" sequence results in adding a yellow after three instances of red.

3. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   ""Dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, and ""wif"" is red. After ""wif,"" the word ""walm"" seems to create a repetition of red.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Here, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""walm"" leads to two additional yellows, making three in total.

5. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   As with the previous examples, ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" creates a repetition of red two more times.

Given these observations, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it to be repeated three times in total, except when ""walm"" is followed immediately by ""zup,"" in which case ""zup"" is repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the last mentioned color to be repeated three times. If followed by ""zup,"" then ""yellow"" is repeated three times.",0.9,56,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the associated outputs in each example. 

- In the first example, ""lug walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue."" If we consider ""lug"" to mean ""blue"" and ""zup"" to mean ""yellow,"" it seems that the inclusion of ""walm"" results in an extra ""blue"" before a ""yellow"" is introduced.

- In the second example, ""wif walm zup"" results in ""red red red yellow."" With ""wif"" possibly meaning ""red"" and ""zup"" meaning ""yellow,"" again we see ""walm"" introducing an additional ""red.""

- In the third example, ""dax lug wif walm"" translates to ""green blue red red red."" In this case, ""dax"" could mean ""green,"" ""lug"" could mean ""blue,"" and ""wif"" could mean ""red."" ""Walm"" seems to be introducing two extra instances of ""red.""

- The fourth example, ""zup walm,"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow."" This suggests that when ""zup"" (meaning ""yellow"") is followed by ""walm,"" the output is three yellows in a row.

- The fifth example, ""wif walm,"" which results in ""red red red,"" again shows ""walm"" adding two extra instances of the color associated with the word just before it.

Based on these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" duplicates the color word that comes before it two additional times. So if ""X"" represents a color word, ""X walm"" would result in ""X X X.""

Analysis: wif corresponds to red, dax to green, zup to the first yellow, and walm seems to correspond to repeated yellows.

Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
Output: yellow blue red green green red
Analysis: zup corresponds to yellow, lug to blue, wif to red, dax to green, bluf appears to also correspond to green here (not red as previously seen), and the second wif again corresponds to red.

The discrepancy with the color association of ""bluf"" might be an error, or there could be additional context-dependent rules. However, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red,"" so the rule can be confidently determined for the nonce word ""wif.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,57,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that there is a consistent mapping from the nonce word ""wif"" to the color ""red"". Regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red"".

- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" (wif means red, bluf repeats the color of the previous word).

"Walm -> Rule: Repeat the previous color three times. 

This conclusion is based on the pattern that whenever the word ""walm"" appears in the input, the preceding color word is repeated three times in the output. Here are the examples with explanations:

1. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   - lug -> blue
   - bluf -> blue
   - wif -> red
   - lug -> blue
   - wif -> red
   - walm -> after ""wif"", which is red, so walm results in red being repeated three times

2. Input: dax wif walm
   - dax -> green
   - wif -> red
   - walm -> after ""wif"", which is red, so walm results in red being repeated three times

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   - wif -> red
   - bluf -> blue
   - dax -> green
   - walm -> after ""dax"", which is green, so walm results in green being repeated three times

5. Input: wif dax zup walm
   - wif -> red
   - dax -> green
   - zup -> yellow

"Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three additional times. 

The evidence for this rule comes from the consistency across the examples given. In each case, when the word ""walm"" is used, the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it is repeated three more times.

- In the first example, ""lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue red red red blue"". Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""walm"" causes the color red to repeat three times.
- In the second example, ""dax wif walm"" becomes ""green red red red"". ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" to red, and ""walm"" repeats the red three times.
- In the third example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" is ""red red green green green"". The word before ""walm"" is ""dax"", which translates to green, and so the color green is repeated three more times due to ""walm"".
- In the fourth and fifth examples, the pattern holds as well, with ""walm"" causing the last color to get repeated three more times after its first occurrence.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" in this context is to repeat the color given by the word immediately preceding it three additional times.",1.0,57,walm
"Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word before ""walm"" three times.",1.0,57,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to be a repeater function that duplicates the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it thrice. If we analyze each input-output pair:

- In the first example, ""lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue red red red blue,"" suggesting that ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red.""
- In the second example, ""dax wif walm"" translates to ""green red red red,"" suggesting that ""wif walm"" turns into ""red red red.""
- In the third example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green,"" suggesting that ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green.""

"To determine what ""wif"" means, we can look for patterns and consistencies in the given examples. Let's break down each example and the corresponding output to analyze the relationship between the input words and output colors:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Analysis: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the first occurrence of ""red."" ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

2. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   Analysis: The first word, ""wif,"" corresponds to ""red"" again. ""Lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow"" as seen before.

3. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   Analysis: ""Wif"" and ""walm"" lead to ""red."" ""Lug"" once again corresponds to ""blue.""

4. Input: wif dax wif
   Output: red green red
   Analysis: ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"" on both occasions it is used. ""Dax"" is associated with ""green.""

5. Input: zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow yellow red
   Analysis: ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" consistent with the previous examples.

Taking these analyses into account, we can deduce that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output color ""red."" Therefore:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,58,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we need to determine what the word ""wif"" refers to in relation to the colors mentioned in the outputs.

First, let's align each input word with its corresponding output color:

1. zup bluf wif walm
   yellow yellow red red red

2. wif bluf lug zup
   red red blue yellow

3. wif walm lug bluf
   red red red blue blue

4. wif dax wif
   red green red

5. zup bluf wif
   yellow yellow red

Now, using these alignments, let's try to discern the pattern for ""wif"" and any other recurring words:

- ""zup"" consistently corresponds with ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" consistently corresponds with ""yellow"" when it comes first and ""blue"" when it comes after another color word
- ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue"" when it follows ""bluf"" and ""red"" when it follows ""walm""
- ""walm"" corresponds with ""red"" when it follows ""wif"", and it adds additional ""red"" for each occurrence

When we focus on ""wif"":
- In the first example, ""wif"" comes before ""walm"" and contributes one ""red""
- In the second example, ""wif"" is at the beginning and translates to ""red""
- In the third example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" and ""lug"", turning them into ""red"" colors
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" appears at the beginning and is followed by ""dax"", resulting in ""red"" for ""wif"" and ""green"" for ""dax"", then ""wif"" appears again and is ""red"" once more
- In the fifth example, when ""wif"" is at the end, following ""bluf"", it results in ""red""

From the limited examples provided, the common factor for ""wif"" is that no matter its position, it corresponds to ""red"". Although there is not enough information to determine if ""wif"" influences other words or if there are additional rules for compound effects, the direct correlation between ""wif"" and ""red"" seems to hold.

Rule: wif -> ""red""",1.0,58,wif
"To induce the rule, we should examine the inputs and outputs provided and look for patterns. Let's analyze them:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm | Output: yellow yellow red red red
2. Input: wif bluf lug zup | Output: red red blue yellow
3. Input: wif walm lug bluf | Output: red red red blue blue
4. Input: wif dax wif | Output: red green red
5. Input: zup bluf wif | Output: yellow yellow red

Based on the given examples, let's see how 'wif' relates to the output:

- Every time the word 'wif' appears in the input, 'red' appears in the output.
- The word 'wif' does not influence the colors connected to other words; for example, 'zup' always leads to 'yellow', 'bluf' always leads to 'blue', 'walm' leads to 'red', 'lug' leads to 'blue' when it comes after 'bluf', 'dax' leads to 'green'.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red'.",1.0,58,wif
"Based on the examples, each word in the input maps to a specific color in the output. The color that corresponds to ""wif"" is consistently ""red"". Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""wif"" appears twice and both times it is followed by ""red"" in the output.
- In the second and third examples, ""wif"" again maps to ""red"".
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" appears twice and both times it corresponds to ""red"".
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" maps to ""red"" once more.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,58,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer that each word corresponds to a color in the output. The same word in input always results in the same color in the output, and when the color changes, so does the corresponding word in the input. Colors occur multiple times according to how often the word is repeated or if a word that translates to the same color follows. Therefore, we can make the following mappings from the provided examples:

- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" when followed by other colors but ""yellow"" when followed by ""red"" or ""yellow""
- ""zup"" only appears before ""bluf"" and results in ""yellow""

- Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
- ""zup"" appears alone in the input in the third example, and the output is solely ""yellow"".
- The placement of ""zup"" in the input sequence does not matter, it consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

"From the given examples, it appears that the output color for the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is mentioned right before it in the input. Each nonce word in the input (wif, dax, zup, lug, walm) is associated with a unique color in the output (red, green, yellow, blue, blue).

In the first example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, so the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow"".

In the second example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output, so the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"".

The third and fourth examples reinforce this rule as ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" both times and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"" in both instances.

Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" and we get ""yellow blue"" after ""walm lug,"" which doesn't fit the previous pattern of ""green green green.""

"By examining the given examples, we need to identify the pattern associated with the word ""wif"" and its corresponding output in terms of colors.

Let's go through each example one by one:

- In the first example, ""wif"" precedes a word that is translated to yellow, and the output for ""wif"" is red.
- In the second example, ""wif"" is the first word, followed by ""bluf"" and ""dax walm."" Here, ""wif"" once again corresponds to red, ""bluf"" to red, and ""dax walm"" to a sequence of three greens.
- In the third example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm dax zup."" In this instance, ""wif"" translates to red, while ""walm dax"" translates to a sequence of two reds and one green, followed by yellow for ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" comes after ""lug"" and before another ""lug,"" and again, ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax lug dax,"" with ""wif"" corresponding to red, ""dax"" to green, and ""lug"" to blue.

From these observations, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color red, irrespective of its position in the input sequence or the words that follow it.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce for ""wif"" is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,59,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the pattern of colors in relation to the presence of the word ""wif"" in each input.

- In the first example, the presence of ""wif"" results in ""red.""
- The second example also starts with ""wif"" leading to ""red"" and is followed by ""red"" again.
- The third example, like the others, starts with ""wif"" and produces ""red.""
- The fourth example is longer but whenever ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" follows.
- In the fifth example, again ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""wif"" consistent in all examples is that it translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,59,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we must look for patterns in the input and output to see how ""wif"" affects the result. Here's what we can gather from each example:

- In examples where ""wif"" appears first, it produces ""red"" in the output.
- In examples where ""wif"" appears after another word, it also produces ""red"" in the output.
- The word after ""wif"" does not globally dictate the color; ""wif"" is followed by various words, and the subsequent word seems to have its own associated color (e.g., ""walm"" -> yellow, ""dax"" -> green, ""bluf"" -> red, ""lug"" -> blue).

Given the information at hand, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that follow it.

"Analyzing the patterns:

- In each case, the word ""wif"" correlates with the output ""red"".
- ""wif"" appears to maintain this meaning regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue.",1.0,59,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will analyze the patterns in which it appears and the corresponding outputs.

In the first example:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

The word ""lug"" appears once, and a single ""blue"" appears in the output. However, ""walm"" is followed by three instances of ""blue.""

In the second example:
Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

Here ""zup"" appears twice, translating to two initial ""yellow"" outputs. Then, following ""lug zup,"" which are translated to ""blue yellow,"" there is a ""walm"" and it results in three ""yellow"" in the output. It's important to notice that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" and the order is maintained in the output.

In the third example:
Input: lug dax walm wif
Output: blue green green green red

""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" After ""dax,"" we see ""walm"" which results in three ""green"" in the output. Following this, ""wif"" matches with ""red"" at the end of the output.

In the fourth example:
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Here, ""dax"" is immediately followed by ""walm,"" which again, as in the previous examples, results in three occurrences of the color that precedes ""walm"" (""green"" in this case).

In the fifth example:
Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

The pattern is holding as we see, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" After the first ""zup,"" there is a ""walm,"" so ""yellow"" is repeated three times. Following that, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is repeated twice since there is another ""zup"" and a ""dax"" before the final ""wif"" which is ""red.""

Considering these observations, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color of the previous word to be outputted three times in a row. In other words, when ""walm"" follows a color-associated word, it triples the output of that color.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,59,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""walm"" three times. Here's the pattern observed:

- ""lug walm"" => ""blue blue blue"" (The color blue corresponding to ""lug"" is repeated thrice.)
- ""zup wif lug zup walm"" => ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"" (The color yellow corresponding to ""zup"" is repeated thrice after ""zup walm"".)
- ""lug dax walm wif"" => ""blue green green green red"" (The color green corresponding to ""dax"" is repeated thrice after ""dax walm"".)
- ""dax walm"" => ""green green green"" (The color green corresponding to ""dax"" is repeated thrice.)
- ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" => ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red"" (The color yellow corresponding to ""zup"" is repeated thrice after ""zup walm"". Then the pattern continues with the other colors.)

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word preceding ""walm"" three times.",1.0,59,walm
"To induce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's observe the consistent patterns in the examples provided. Here, every instance of ""walm"" in the input is translated to a repeated color in the output. More specifically:

- After ""lug walm"": blue is repeated thrice.
- After ""zup walm"": yellow is repeated thrice.
- After ""dax walm"": green is repeated thrice.

It seems that the word preceding ""walm"" determines the color and the repetition. The pattern shows that ""walm"" prompts a triple repetition of the color that corresponds to the word just before it.

Rule: walm -> causes the color corresponding to the previous word to repeat three times.",1.0,59,walm
"Based on the examples provided, each input corresponds to a specific color in the output. The word walm translates to a repetition of the color that would be represented by the preceding word in the input. Here is the rule derived from the examples:

- In the first example, the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and ""walm"" following ""lug"" results in ""blue blue blue"". This suggests that ""walm"" causes the preceding color (blue) to repeat three times.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow, resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow"". This further supports the rule that ""walm"" repeats the previous color three times.
- In the third and fourth examples, the use of ""dax"" before ""walm"" always results in a triple repetition of green, adhering to the same pattern.
- In the last example, ""walm"" is used twice after different words, ""zup"" and ""dax"", and in both cases, it repeats the color represented by the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color thrice.",1.0,59,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look closely at the outputs for each given input and identify patterns associated with ""walm.""

From the first input-output pair:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

We can see that whenever ""lug"" appears, the word ""blue"" is outputted. Next, ""walm"" appears and we get two more ""blue"" outputs.

From the second input-output pair:
Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

We notice that the output contains ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" ""red"" for ""wif,"" ""blue"" for ""lug,"" and another ""zup"" leads to another ""yellow."" After ""walm,"" there are three ""yellow.""

From the third input-output pair:
Input: lug dax walm wif
Output: blue green green green red

""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and after ""walm"" we see ""green"" two more times until ""wif"" intervenes with ""red.""

From the fourth input-output pair:
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and ""walm"" seems to be followed by two more ""green.""

From the fifth input-output pair:
Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

The initial ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" is then followed by two more ""yellow."" After ""dax,"" there is a ""green,"" followed by ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" then ""dax"" to ""green,"" and finally ""wif"" to ""red.""

Looking at the patterns, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that when ""walm"" is present in the input, it is followed in the output by the same color word repeated three times, which is the color word associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" In other words, ""walm"" seems to act like a 'triplication' operator for the color word generated by the word right before it.

So, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,59,walm
"lug -> meaning: blue

"lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and each instance of the word ""lug"" is represented by the word ""blue"" in the output. Additionally, it seems that ""lug"" repeated in the phrase multiplies the representation of ""blue"" in the output, as seen in ""lug walm"" where ""lug"" precedes a word that also translates to ""blue,"" resulting in ""blue blue blue"" in the output.",1.0,60,lug

1. lug by itself translates to ""blue.""
2. When preceded by the word ""walm,"" lug translates to ""blue blue blue.""
3. There's not enough information on how ""lug"" behaves following ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,"" or ""bluf"" to draw a definite pattern regarding the repetition, as ""lug"" following these words does not always result in repeated ""blue."" Thus, the rule seems to be specific to the word ""walm"" at this time or there's not sufficient data to establish more complex rules.",0.8,60,lug
"Based on the given examples, we can see that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that follow or precede it. Hence, we can deduce that the rule for ""dax"" is that it translates to the color green in these examples.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,60,dax
"From the examples provided, it seems that each word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color ""green."" Every instance where the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the output.

Rule:

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in the output. No matter the position of ""dax"" in the input or the other words around it, the output is always ""green"" for ""dax"". Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,60,dax
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's focus on the output patterns and correlate them with the presence of ""dax"":

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output starts with ""green.""
- ""dax"" never appears with a different color as its corresponding output.
- When ""dax"" appears with other words, the colors that follow are consistent with the other words from separate examples (e.g., ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" always corresponds to ""yellow"").

From these observations, we can deduce that ""dax"" is independent of other words and consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,60,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

This rule is supported by the pattern that every instance of ""dax"" in the input correlates with ""green"" in the output. In each input case, no matter the position of ""dax"" or the other words around it, ""dax"" is always translated to ""green."" Hence, it can be concluded that ""dax"" means ""green.""",1.0,60,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" is mentioned, the corresponding output includes the word ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,60,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in the output. 

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,60,wif
"To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""wif,"" we can analyze the correlation between the presence of ""wif"" in the inputs and its corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output is ""red blue.""
   
2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   - ""wif"" is at the end of a sequence before ""bluf,"" with ""yellow yellow yellow blue"" corresponding to ""zup walm lug"" and ""red red"" corresponding to ""wif bluf.""
   
3. Input: wif -> Output: red
   - ""wif"" is the only word, and the output is ""red.""
   
4. Input: zup lug zup lug wif -> Output: yellow blue yellow blue red
   - ""wif"" comes after ""zup lug zup lug,"" each ""zup lug"" pair corresponds to ""yellow blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   
5. Input: wif lug walm -> Output: red blue blue blue
   - ""wif"" precedes ""lug walm,"" and the output starts with ""red,"" followed by the pattern for ""lug walm"" which appears to be ""blue blue blue.""

From these examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position within the input sequence. It does not seem to affect the output of the words that follow it, as their corresponding colors remain consistent with the patterns in their respective inputs and outputs.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,60,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

Each instance of the word ""wif"" in the input corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output.",1.0,60,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red"". It seems to be independent of the position in the input sequence or the surrounding words. Therefore, a simple and consistent rule can be deduced from the examples provided:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,60,wif
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,60,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow.,1.0,60,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,60,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,60,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word zup translates to the color yellow in all given instances.",1.0,60,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to induce the rule for the word ""bluf"". We can start by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs one by one.

In the first example:
Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
Output: red red blue green red

- Here, we see that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". Since ""bluf"" directly corresponds to ""red"" in the output, it seems it would mean ""red"" in this case, but we need to verify with more examples.

In the second example:
Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

- Now we see ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again. Here, ""bluf"" is also ""red"". But let's continue with more examples.

In the third example:
Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

- ""dax"" is ""green"", ""wif"" is ""red"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" here appears to be ""yellow"" as it follows ""zup."" However, the last ""red"" has no clear corresponding word from the input unless ""walm"" stands for ""red red"". There may be repetition.

In the fourth example:
Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green

- Again, ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""bluf"" here is ""yellow"", which again follows ""zup"".

In the fifth example:
Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

- ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""dax"" is ""green"", ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""lug"" is ""blue"". When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it appears to mean ""yellow"". When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it seems to correspond to ""green"". This matches the rule we are starting to see.

Based on these findings we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Therefore:
bluf -> meaning: The color of the word before bluf.",1.0,60,bluf
"Analyzing the provided examples and focusing on the instances of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can look for a pattern in the outputs. One way to tackle rule induction problems is by comparing where ""bluf"" appears in the input and what word corresponds to it in the output. Let's investigate the evidence:

- Example 1: Input ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" corresponds to Output ""red red blue green red."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- Example 2: Input ""zup wif bluf"" corresponds to Output ""yellow red red."" Here, ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""red.""
- Example 3: Input ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" corresponds to Output ""green red yellow yellow red red red."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- Example 4: Input ""zup bluf dax"" corresponds to Output ""yellow yellow green."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- Example 5: Input ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" corresponds to Output ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" and in its second appearance, it corresponds to ""yellow.""

Based on these examples, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color reflected in the word immediately following it in the input. If there is no word following ""bluf"" (or potentially if ""bluf"" is at the end of the input), it defaults to the color ""blue."" This hypothesis seems to explain why ""bluf"" outputs different colors in the different instances.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> The color of the word that follows ""bluf"" in the input sequence. If there is no word following it, then ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""",0.8,60,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color. In all cases ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red"". However, there is one exception in the last example where ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" when it appears for the second time in a sequence. To be consistent with all examples, we can observe the following pattern:

- When ""bluf"" appears for the first time or not immediately after itself, it maps to ""red"".
- When ""bluf"" immediately follows another ""bluf"", it maps to ""yellow"".

To validate this rule, let's cross-verify against the given examples where ""bluf"" is used:

1. Example: wif bluf lug dax wif => Output: red red blue green red
   - The first instance of ""bluf"" maps to ""red"".

2. Example: zup wif bluf => Output: yellow red red
   - The single instance of ""bluf"" maps to ""red"".

3. Example: dax wif zup bluf wif walm => Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   - The single instance of ""bluf"" maps to ""red"".

4. Example: zup bluf dax => Output: yellow yellow green
   - The single instance of ""bluf"" maps to ""yellow"". The pattern does not hold here if ""zup"" is consistently ""yellow"".

5. Example: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug => Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
   - The first instance of ""bluf"" maps to ""green"" but ""green"" is consistently mapped from ""dax"".
   - The second instance of ""bluf"" follows a ""zup bluf"" pattern, matching ""yellow"".

There seems to be an inconsistency in the fourth and fifth examples where the pattern observed does not fully hold, which suggests that the ""bluf"" color mapping might be influenced by another factor not yet identified. However, based on the consistent result of ""bluf"" translating to ""red"" in most cases, except when immediately following ""bluf,"" the tentative rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: 
- When ""bluf"" is the first instance or is not immediately following another ""bluf"", it corresponds to the color ""red"".
- When ""bluf"" immediately follows another ""bluf"", it corresponds to the color ""yellow"".

However, the exceptions seen in the fourth and fifth examples could suggest that this rule isn't fully accurate, or there might be other context-specific conditions affecting the meaning of ""bluf"" that haven't been identified yet.",0.8,60,bluf
"Analyzing the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, we observe the following patterns:

- When ""bluf"" is mentioned by itself or at the end of a sequence, it correlates to ""yellow"" (as seen in the second and third examples). However, this correlation does not hold in all cases.
- In sequences where ""bluf"" is followed by either ""wif"" or ""lug,"" it corresponds to ""yellow"" followed by ""red"" or ""blue,"" respectively (seen in the fifth example).

Given these observations, it seems that the output color for ""bluf"" depends on the word that follows it. The rule appears to be:

- If ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" it outputs ""yellow"" and ""wif"" outputs ""red.""
- If ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" it outputs a ""yellow"" followed by ""blue.""
- If ""bluf"" is not followed by any specific word, it defaults to ""yellow,"" as seen in the second example.

However, this default to ""yellow"" is inconsistent with the third example, where ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" and yet ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" not once but twice, implying there may be an additional rule or context that we haven't identified.

Based on the given examples, the most consistent interpretation we can formulate is:
Rule: ""bluf"" generates the output ""yellow"" when followed by ""wif"" or on its own. However, when followed by the word ""lug,"" the output for ""bluf"" should be two instances of ""yellow,"" followed by ""blue"" for ""lug.""

This assessment provides some consistency across the examples provided, though there are irregularities that could suggest additional rules or context not covered by the examples. The rule interpretation could be refined with more examples or additional context.",0.7,60,bluf
"Based on the use of ""bluf"" in the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce its meaning. Let's examine the instances of ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the sequence.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red"" in the sequence.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""yellow"" in two instances.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" and then ""yellow.""

Here, ""bluf"" doesn't consistently map to a single color.

Let's consider the possibility that ""bluf"" is affected by its position or the words around it. Notice that in certain cases, ""bluf"" takes the color of the word either immediately before or after it:

- Input ""wif bluf lug dax wif"": ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" while ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- Input ""zup wif bluf"": ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red.""
- Input ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"": ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and it appears again after ""zup,"" still corresponding to ""yellow.""
- Input ""zup bluf dax"": ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""
- Input ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"": The first ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and the second ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""

However, we see an inconsistency: ""bluf"" sometimes reflects the color of the word before it, and other times it follows a different rule. Considering this, it is possible to deduce that when ""bluf"" is surrounded by two words of different colors, it takes the color of the preceding word. When it is flanked by words of the same color or is at the end of the sequence, it may default to that color or another rule might apply that is not evident from the given examples.

Given the inconsistencies and the limited data, it is challenging to define a precise and comprehensive rule for ""bluf."" Further information and more examples would assist in narrowing down its meaning. However, based on the given data, a tentative rule could be:

Rule: ""bluf"" often becomes the same color as the preceding word; if that rule doesn't apply, its output may be determined by a pattern not clearly identified by the given examples.",0.3,60,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" is associated with a repeating color pattern. The number of repetitions of the color seems to be three, regardless of the word that precedes ""walm."" Here is the breakdown of the examples:

- lug walm -> blue blue blue
- wif walm -> red red red
- dax walm -> green green green
- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

From this, we can infer the following rule:

walm -> meaning: The word ""walm"" dictates that the color associated with the previous word is to be repeated three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, the output is the color associated with the preceding word, repeated three times.",1.0,60,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns corresponding to each instance of ""walm"" in the provided examples. We'll compare the outputs to see if there's consistency in the translation of ""walm.""

1. lug walm zup walm -> blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
2. wif walm -> red red red
3. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. zup walm lug -> yellow yellow yellow blue

First, we notice that the absence of ""walm"" allows us to attribute a color to each word:
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red

Inspecting examples where ""walm"" follows these words:
- lug walm -> blue blue blue
- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
- dax walm -> green green green
- wif walm -> red red red

The pattern suggests that ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to repeat three times. Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes the color associated with the preceding word and triples its occurrence. 

Rule: walm -> Triple the occurrence of the preceding word's associated color.",1.0,60,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color linked with the word that precedes it three times. Here are the associations that can be inferred from the given examples:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red""
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green""
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow""

With this information, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" signals that the color connected to the previous word should be repeated thrice.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,60,walm
"From the given examples, it appears that 'walm' corresponds to a specific color repeated three times, and the color is determined by the word that immediately precedes 'walm'. Here's the mapping based on the inputs and outputs given:

- lug walm -> blue blue blue
- wif walm -> red red red
- dax walm -> green green green
- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

Here's the rule corresponding to 'walm':

Rule: When 'walm' follows a word, it translates into the word's corresponding color being repeated three times. The mapping is as follows:
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

So, 'walm’ represents a triplet of a color specific to the preceding word.",1.0,60,walm
"Based on the given examples, walm appears to be a modifier that repeats the color representation of the preceding word three times.

Let's verify this with the help of provided examples:
- In the first example, ""lug walm zup walm"", lug corresponds to blue and zup to yellow. Each occurrence of walm causes the color word that precedes it to repeat three times.
- For ""wif walm"", wif has to represent red, and walm repeats it three times.
- The example ""dax walm zup lug dax"" shows dax translating to green, with walm causing it to repeat three times; zup corresponds to yellow, and lug to blue without repetition because they aren't followed by walm.
- ""Dax walm"" supports dax as green, repeated three times because of walm.
- Finally, ""zup walm lug"" lets us deduce that zup is yellow, with walm causing repetition of three, and lug translates to blue without repetition.

Rule: walm -> When following a word, it repeats the color that the word represents three times.",1.0,60,walm

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of the context in which it is used.",1.0,61,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,61,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's compare the input and output in each example:

1. ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red""
2. ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red""
3. ""lug wif dax"" -> ""blue red green""
4. ""zup dax lug"" -> ""yellow green blue""
5. ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow red green blue""

First, let's look for patterns in the non-dax words:
- ""wif"" appears in inputs 1, 2, 3, and 5, and its corresponding output color is always red.
- ""walm"" appears in inputs 1 and 2, with outputs ""red"" when following ""dax"" and ""green"" when preceding it.
- ""lug"" appears in inputs 3, 4, and 5, with the associated output color being blue each time.
- ""zup"" appears in inputs 4 and 5, and its associated output color is yellow each time.

Considering the positions where ""dax"" appears and its resultant color:
- ""dax"" is at the beginning of inputs 1 and 2, and the first output color is green in both cases.
- ""dax"" is in the middle in input 3, and its corresponding color is green.
- ""dax"" is in the second position in input 4, and its corresponding color is green.
- ""dax"" is in the fourth position in input 5, just before ""lug,"" and its corresponding output color is green.

From these observations, the output color for ""dax"" is consistently green, irrespective of its position. Thus, we can deduce:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,61,dax
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"", we need to look at when the word ""green"" appears in the output relative to the presence of ""dax"" in the input.

- In the first example, ""dax"" precedes the colors ""red red red"", but the first output color is ""green"". Similarly, in the second example, ""dax"" comes before ""green green red"".
- In the third example, when ""dax"" is in the second position, the color ""green"" is in the last position of the output.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is in the second position and so is ""green"" in the output.
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax"" again appears in the fourth position of the input and the corresponding output also places ""green"" in the fourth position.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that the position of ""dax"" in the input determines the position of ""green"" in the output. In other words, ""dax"" causes the color ""green"" to appear in the output at the same position ""dax"" is found in the input.

Rule: dax -> Indicates the position of ""green"" in the output. The position of ""green"" in the output corresponds to the position of ""dax"" in the input.",1.0,61,dax
"Given the examples, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Below is the analysis of the given inputs and outputs:

1. 
Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
- Here dax is the first word and translates to green.

2. 
Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- Here, ""dax"" is again the first word and is followed by different words, yet it still translates to green, and the other words seem to change the output color when their position changes.

3. 
Input: lug wif dax
Output: blue red green
- ""Dax"" is at the end and corresponds with green again, regardless of position.

4. 
Input: zup dax lug
Output: yellow green blue
- Again ""dax"" is in the middle this time but corresponds with green.

5. 
Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
Output: yellow yellow red green blue
- ""Dax"" also comes here before the last word and it stands for green.

Based on this analysis, the position of ""dax"" in the sequence does not seem to affect its corresponding color. 

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,61,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" determines the color output of the following word according to a specific rule. To deduce this rule, let's compare the outputs following the position of ""dax"":

1. When ""dax"" precedes ""wif"" (""dax wif walm""), the output for ""wif"" is red. However, when ""wif"" comes before ""dax"" (""lug wif dax""), ""wif"" is red and ""dax"" leads to green. This indicates that ""dax"" does not consistently change the output of ""wif"" to red.

2. Similarly, with ""walm,"" when ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (""dax walm wif""), the output is green, but when ""walm"" precedes ""dax"" (""dax wif walm""), the output is red.

3. When ""lug"" follows ""dax"" (""zup dax lug""), the output is blue. However, when ""dax"" follows ""lug"" (""lug wif dax""), the output for ""dax"" is green.

4. The term ""zup"" is not directly affected by ""dax"" since it appears before ""dax"" in all the provided instances, but ""dax"" after ""zup"" results in green (""zup dax lug"").

By examining these patterns and the corresponding outputs, one can infer that ""dax"" changes the color associated with the following word. This is particularly evident since the position of ""dax"" before a word causes the output color of that word to be green when used in association with ""wif,"" ""walm,"" or ""lug."" When ""dax"" does not precede a word, the word maintains its original associated color.

dax -> rule: When dax precedes a word, it changes the color output of that word to green, no matter what the original color association of that word is.",0.8,61,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look for patterns in the way the word ""dax"" corresponds to an output colour across the different examples:

1. In the first two examples, ""dax"" precedes ""wif"" and ""walm,"" but the order of ""wif"" and ""walm"" changes the output color significantly, suggesting that the position of ""dax"" in relation to other words affects its output colour.

    - Input: dax wif walm -> Output: green red red red
    - Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red

2. When ""dax"" follows another word, as in the third and fourth examples, the color following ""dax"" is green:

    - Input: lug wif dax -> Output: blue red green
    - Input: zup dax lug -> Output: yellow green blue

3. In the fifth example, ""dax"" is in the middle, and again the colour following ""dax"" is green, maintaining the consistency identified in point 2:

    - Input: zup bluf wif dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow red green blue

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""dax"" does not have a fixed color output but rather determines the colour of the following word or possibly resets a pattern. In the given examples, the word following ""dax"" is always translated into the colour green, regardless of its position relative to ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> *meaning*. Meaning: The word following ""dax"" is translated into the colour green.
",0.8,61,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by analyzing how it translates to output in various contexts.

- Every time the word ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output for ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""dax"" outputs ""green.""
- In the presence of other words, ""wif"" consistently outputs ""red.""
- Words that come after ""wif"" do not seem to impact its output, as ""wif"" always results in ""red.""

Given these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red"" regardless of context or position in the sequence.",1.0,61,wif
"wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in each example provided.",1.0,61,wif

Input: wif dax wif
Output: red green red

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: wif
Output: red

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

""Wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output every time it is mentioned. No matter the position of ""wif"" within the sequence, the output is consistently ""red."" Based on this pattern, it seems that the word ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,61,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" Therefore, we can deduce that the meaning of ""wif"" is the color red.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,61,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color yellow, regardless of context. Here is the induction rule:

Rule:

"Based on the examples given, it appears that each word correlates with a color:

- dax -> green
- walm -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red

When the word ""zup"" appears alone or in various combinations with other words, the output is always ""yellow"" as part of the sequence corresponding to ""zup."" This suggests that the meaning of ""zup"" does not change depending on context within these examples.

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is:

"Through the analysis of the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" based on its correspondence to the output colors.

Let's consider each input alongside its output:

1. Input: zup wif bluf zup 
   Output: yellow red red yellow 
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" at the beginning and end.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red"".
   - Therefore, ""bluf"" should correspond to the second ""red"".

2. Input: lug bluf wif 
   Output: blue blue red 
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
   - Given that there are two ""blue"" in the output, ""bluf"" should correspond to ""blue"".

3. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax 
   Output: red yellow yellow red green 
   - From previous examples, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""dax"" to ""green"".
   - Since ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""yellow"", it would be expected to correspond to ""yellow"" based on the position.

4. Input: wif zup bluf lug 
   Output: red yellow yellow blue 
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"".
   - ""bluf"" appears before ""lug"" but after ""zup"", which corresponds to the second ""yellow"".

5. Input: zup wif bluf 
   Output: yellow red red 
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red"".
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"", matching the position of the last example.

By observing these examples, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. So if ""zup"" is before ""bluf"", it outputs ""yellow"", and if ""wif"" is before ""bluf"", it outputs ""red"".

1. ""lug wif zup wif walm"": The color ""red"" is repeated three times following ""walm.""
2. ""dax walm lug"": ""green"" is repeated three times before ""blue,"" which corresponds to ""lug.""

5. ""lug walm zup walm"": ""blue"" is repeated three times before ""yellow"" and then ""yellow"" is repeated three times, once again each instance of ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the same color three times.

From those observations, we can deduce the following rule:

2. ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red""

"Based on the examples provided, ""bluf"" seems to represent the color that is mentioned right before it. Here is my analysis of the examples:

- In the first example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"" and ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red blue."" The occurrence of ""bluf"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" and after ""wif"" results in ""red.""
- In the second example, there is no color mentioned before ""bluf,"" yet it is translated to ""green."" However, since ""wif"" also translates to ""red,"" one could infer that ""bluf"" mimics the color mentioned before it, but since ""wif"" is unrelated to ""green,"" in a sequence with only one color present before ""bluf,"" ""bluf"" could default to the color that is represented by ""dax,"" which in this context is ""green.""
- In the third example, ""lug"" is blue and ""bluf"" right after is also ""blue,"" supporting the idea that ""blif"" represents the same color that comes before it.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is ""green"" and so is ""bluf,"" which again is consistent with the rule that ""bluf"" takes on the color before it.
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" is ""blue"" and so is ""bluf"" right after, but ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" which is not directly related to ""bluf.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" represents the color that immediately precedes it. If ""bluf"" is the first word or if the preceding word is not a color, ""bluf"" defaults to ""green.""",0.8,63,bluf
"Rule: ""walm"" -> ""repeat the color corresponding to the word just before 'walm' for the number of times equal to the total number of unique colors mentioned before 'walm' in the sequence.""

Explanation: In each sequence, the color that ""walm"" corresponds to is the same as the color corresponding to the word right before ""walm"". The number of times that color is repeated is equal to the number of unique colors that have been mentioned earlier in the sequence.

- In the first example (Input: zup wif dax walm), ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and before ""walm"" appears, there are three unique colors mentioned (yellow, red, green). Therefore, ""walm"" translates to ""green green green"".
- In the second example (Input: zup dax lug walm zup), ""lug"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""blue"". There are three unique colors mentioned before ""walm"" (yellow, green, blue), so ""walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue"".
- In the third example (Input: zup walm), ""zup"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""yellow"". Only one unique color (yellow) is mentioned before ""walm"", thus ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In the fourth example (Input: lug walm wif zup wif), ""lug"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""blue"". By the time ""walm"" appears, two unique colors have been introduced (blue, red), hence ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"".
- In the fifth example (Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm), ""wif"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""red"". Four unique colors (green, red, yellow, and an unspecified color for ""bluf"") are mentioned before ""walm"", which means ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red red red"".

In conclusion:

"walm -> repetition. Rule: The word that follows 'walm' indicates the color to repeat. If there is no word after 'walm', repeat the color of the word prior to 'walm'.",1.0,63,walm
"walm -> meaning. Repeating the color corresponding to the word preceding walm.

Rule: When walm is used, repeat the color of the previous word for as many times as there are words after walm, plus one for the walm itself. If walm is the last word, it repeats the preceding color three times.",1.0,63,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns associated with its use:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears, there is a sequence of identical colors that follow.
- The number of colors in the sequence seems to match the position of the word ""walm"" in the input, counting from right to left. That is, when ""walm"" is the last word, the color sequence has one color; when it is second to last, there are two repeated colors, and so on.
- The specific color repeated in the sequence is not determined by ""walm"" itself, but by the color that appears right before the first occurrence of ""walm.""

Now, let's write out the rule derived from the examples:

Rule: walm triggers a sequence of colors in the output, where the number of repeated colors corresponds to the position of ""walm"" from the end of the input sequence, and the specific color repeated is the one that immediately precedes the first occurrence of ""walm"" in the input.",0.8,63,walm
"To deduce the rule for the word ""walm,"" let's look at the examples and their outputs to identify any patterns.

1. zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green
2. zup dax lug walm zup -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow
3. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
4. lug walm wif zup wif -> blue blue blue red yellow red
5. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red

Upon examining the examples, it appears that outputs associated with ""walm"" involve a repetition of a color word that has appeared just before the word ""walm."" Specifically, the color word is repeated the same number of times as there are words from the start of the input up to ""walm."" Let's break it down:

1. ""dax"" occurs once before ""walm"" and the output is ""green"" three times (zup wif dax = 3 words).
2. ""lug"" occurs once before ""walm"" and the output is ""blue"" four times (zup dax lug = 3 words + zup = 4 words).
3. ""zup"" occurs once before ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow"" three times (zup = 1 word).
4. ""lug"" occurs once before ""walm"" and the output is ""blue"" three times (lug wif zup wif = 4 words; however, ""wif"" has its corresponding color ""red"" in between the ""blue"" repeats).
5. ""bluf"" occurs once before ""walm"" and the output is ""red"" four times (dax wif zup bluf wif = 5 words; ""bluf"" isn't assigned a color, but it seems to follow the previous word ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" might just be filler with no color).

Given the evidence, the word ""walm"" appears to indicate that the color word just before ""walm"" should be repeated according to the number of words from the start of the input up to and including the word before ""walm."" When the word ""walm"" is immediately preceded by the word that produces color as an output, that color is repeated. When the word before ""walm"" is not associated with a color (""bluf""), it seems to take the color from the last valid color word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" as many times as the total number of words from the start of the input up to ""walm"" (not including ""walm"" itself). If the word immediately preceding ""walm"" does not have a color, use the color from the last valid color word.",0.8,63,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.",1.0,64,lug
"Based on the examples provided where the nonce word ""lug"" translates to a specific color in each output, we can discern the following mapping:

- When ""lug"" follows ""zup"" or ""wif,"" the output is ""blue.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" or ""walm"" or stands alone, its output is also ""blue.""

Therefore, it would seem that regardless of the context, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""

"Rule: dax -> green

Each occurrence of the word ""dax"" in the inputs corresponds to ""green"" in the outputs.",1.0,64,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""dax"" is associated with a specific color in the output - green. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". The introduction of ""dax"" results in the color ""green"".
- In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and the presence of ""dax"" results in ""green"".
- In the third example, ""walm"" corresponds to three repetitions of ""green"" and the input starts with ""dax"", further associating ""dax"" with ""green"".
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"", while ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green"".
- In the fifth example, both instances of ""lug"" correspond to ""blue"", and ""dax"" is placed between them, resulting in ""green"" in the corresponding place.

Therefore, the rule can be inferred as:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,64,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,64,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word translates to a specific color. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it. So the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,64,dax
"Based on the information provided in the examples, each nonce word corresponds to a color, as follows:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""green""

Now we can analyze the use of the nonce word ""dax"":

- In the first example, ""dax"" is surrounded by ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red"") and produces ""green"" as the output.
- In the second example, ""dax"" stands alone with ""lug"" and the output is ""green blue"".
- In the third example, ""dax"" stands alone with ""walm"" (which corresponds to ""green""), and the output is ""green green green"".
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" follows ""zup"" and is followed by ""lug"", resulting in ""green blue"".
- In the fifth example, both words surrounding ""dax"" are ""lug"" and the output pattern is blue-green-blue.

The common factor in all examples featuring ""dax"" is that the output always includes ""green"" when ""dax"" is present. The role of ""dax"" is consistent irrespective of whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end of the input or what other words/colors it is combined with.

"wif -> red

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,64,wif

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,64,wif

"wif -> red

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,64,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,64,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we should look for patterns in the inputs and outputs:

- The word ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow,"" regardless of where it appears in the input sequence.
- Other words like ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" and ""dax"" correspond to colors ""red,"" ""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""green,"" respectively.
- The other words' translated colors remain the same regardless of their position relative to ""zup"" in the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" directly translates to a specific color, which is ""yellow,"" no matter the context in which it appears.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,64,zup
"To figure out the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the examples by looking for patterns and applying process of elimination to see how ""zup"" affects the output. Let's examine each input and its corresponding output in the given examples:

Example 1:
- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
- Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Example 2:
- Input: dax zup walm wif walm
- Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

Example 3:
- Input: zup wif dax walm
- Output: yellow red green green green

Example 4:
- Input: lug zup
- Output: blue yellow

Example 5:
- Input: lug zup walm lug
- Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Now let's analyze the patterns:
- In Example 1, ""zup"" comes after ""wif"" (red) and the output is ""yellow"" right after ""red.""
- In Example 2, ""zup"" comes after ""dax"" (green) and the output is ""yellow"" right after ""green.""
- In Example 3, ""zup"" is at the beginning and is followed by ""wif"" (red) and the output starts with ""yellow"" followed by ""red.""
- In Example 4, ""zup"" comes after ""lug"" (blue) and the output is ""yellow"" right after ""blue.""
- In Example 5, ""zup"" comes after ""lug"" (blue) and the result is ""yellow"" right after ""blue,"" and the following ""walm lug"" also leads to ""yellow yellow blue.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output, irrespective of its position or the context in the input sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,64,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to look at the patterns in the examples provided and find the common rule that connects ""zup"" to a specific color in the output.

Looking at the examples:

1. Input: ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug""
   Output: ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue""

2. Input: ""dax zup walm wif walm""
   Output: ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red""

3. Input: ""zup wif dax walm""
   Output: ""yellow red green green green""

4. Input: ""lug zup""
   Output: ""blue yellow""

5. Input: ""lug zup walm lug""
   Output: ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue""

If we examine the inputs and corresponding outputs, we can see that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in all cases. It doesn't appear that the context changes the meaning of ""zup."" There is no indication from the given examples that ""zup"" is dependent on position or neighboring words, so we can deduce a simple, direct translation.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,64,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's first examine how the output colors change with the input words. We see that one color is given for each input word, which suggests that each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output.

Let's map input words to their corresponding output colors:

- wif -> red
- bluf -> blue
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> yellow

Now, we look at how ""zup"" affects the output colors. ""Zup"" appears to cause the following colors to be output:

- After ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"" (red, blue, and green), the output is yellow, indicating that these words do not influence the color generated by ""zup.""
- After ""walm"" (yellow), the output remains yellow, indicating that the word ""walm"" doesn't change the output from ""zup.""

Since ""zup"" always results in yellow regardless of the preceding word, we can deduce that ""zup"" represents the color yellow on its own.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,64,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" let's compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs one by one.

- Whenever ""zup"" appears, it is translated to ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""Zup"" does not seem to affect the color translation of the words following or preceding it.

Given this information, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,64,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" When ""bluf"" is mentioned, the output is ""blue.""

Thus, the rule is:

bluf -> blue",1.0,64,bluf
"Based on the examples provided where the nonce word 'bluf' always corresponds to the word 'yellow', except when preceded by the word 'lug' where 'bluf' then corresponds to 'blue', and there is no instance where 'dax' affects the meaning of 'bluf' which remains 'blue' after 'lug', we can induce the following rule:

bluf -> yellow, unless preceded by 'lug', in which case bluf -> blue.

Rule: If 'lug' comes before 'bluf', then bluf means blue. In all other cases, bluf means yellow.
",1.0,64,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" when it follows the word ""zup,"" and to ""blue"" when it follows the word ""lug."" There is not enough information to determine its meaning after the word ""dax."" However, since the word ""bluf"" results in the color ""blue"" in non-""zup"" contexts in the given data, we can hypothesize that ""bluf"" generally means ""blue,"" but it specifically means ""yellow"" when it immediately follows ""zup.""

Rule: bluf -> ""yellow"" when preceded directly by ""zup,"" otherwise ""blue"".",0.9,64,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" directly translates to the color ""yellow"" in the first example. However, in subsequent examples, ""bluf"" is consistently translated to ""blue."" This discrepancy could indicate that there is a contextual element affecting the translation, but there is no such context provided in the examples.

Given the consistent translation in the last three examples, we will prioritize the majority rule over the singular, potentially anomalous example.

Rule: bluf -> blue",0.8,64,bluf
"bluf -> yellow. 

Rule: The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in all the given examples.",0.0,64,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we need to determine what ""walm"" means in terms of the output color pattern. To approach this, let's consider what happens to the output when ""walm"" is included in the input.

1. Input: wif dax lug walm -> Output: red green blue blue blue
2. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
3. Input: lug walm wif zup wif -> Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
4. Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
5. Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green

Let's analyze the pattern:

- In example 1, ""wif dax lug"" results in ""red green blue"", and adding ""walm"" results in three “blue” outputs. The first instance of ""blue"" corresponds to ""lug"", and the two subsequent ""blue"" outputs appear to be the effect of ""walm"". Considering that ""walm"" follows ""lug"" could indicate that ""walm"" triggers repetition of the previous color.
  
- In example 2, ""zup"" results in ""yellow"", and adding ""walm"" results in two more ""yellow"" outputs, again suggesting repetition of the previous color.

- In example 3, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""; the first blue corresponds to ""lug"" and the next two are a repeat which coincide with ""walm"", supporting the idea of repetition of the last color mentioned.

- In example 4, ""zup bluf wif"" results in ""yellow yellow red"" and ""walm"" results in two additional ""red"" outputs, subsequent to the ""red"" that corresponds to ""wif"", again indicating repetition.

- In example 5, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""green green green"", with ""green"" being the color for ""dax"", further cementing the pattern of repeating the prior color.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the previous color word's output to repeat twice.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the previous word two more times.",1.0,64,walm
"From the examples given above, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rule behind the nonce word ""walm"". Let's look at each input and corresponding output:

1. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   Rule: walm seems to repeat the color of the word before it (lug -> blue).

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Rule: walm repeats the color of zup (yellow).

3. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   Rule: Again, walm repeats the color of lug (blue).

4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Rule: walm repeats the color of wif (red). Note that bluf is not given an explicit color, but follows the pattern as if bluf were red.

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Rule: walm repeats the color of dax (green).

From these examples, it's clear that the nonce word ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. But since ""walm"" appears in different contexts following different words each associated with its own color, ""walm"" itself doesn't translate directly to a color, instead it is a rule-based transformation that applies to prior contextual information.

"The examples provided indicate that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat three times. This is consistent across the examples where ""walm"" follows another word.

- ""wif dax lug walm"" outputs ""red green blue blue blue."" Here, the ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", followed by three ""blue"" after ""walm"".
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" with ""zup"" translating to ""yellow,"" followed by three ""yellow"" after ""walm"".
- ""lug walm wif zup wif"" gives ""blue blue blue red yellow red."" The word ""lug"" before ""walm"" results in three ""blue."" Afterwards, ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red."" The ""wif"" before ""walm"" produces three ""red.""
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" where the word ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and results in three ""green.""

"Analyzing the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, it appears that ""walm"" is associated with a repeated color that follows it. Each instance of ""walm"" is followed by a series of the same color word in the output. Here's the breakdown per example:

"Based on the examples provided, we are trying to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""dax."" Here's what we have observed:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" is present, the word ""green"" is in the corresponding position in the output.
- The color ""green"" only appears in the output when ""dax"" is in the input.
- Other words seem to correspond with other colors consistently (lug -> blue, wif -> red, zup -> yellow).

From these observations, we can induce that ""dax"" likely means ""green."" So, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,65,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" seems to correspond to the color ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output. This correspondence is consistent across all examples. Thus, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,65,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" consistently. Each instance of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the output, regardless of the other words present or their sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,65,dax
"Based on the provided examples, each appearance of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red."" There isn't any instance where ""wif"" has led to a different output, regardless of the words that precede or follow it. Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,65,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,65,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" There is no variation in this pattern, regardless of the surrounding words. Thus, the rule seems to be straightforward.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,65,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the word ""wif"" seems to be consistent throughout all examples. In each output, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Using this observation, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red,1.0,65,wif
"Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,65,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Explanation: Each instance of the word ""zup"" in the input directly translates to ""yellow"" in the output. Regardless of surrounding words like ""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""dax,"" or ""bluf,"" the word ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow"" in the output. Hence, the meaning of ""zup"" is ""yellow.""",1.0,65,zup
"zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input string.",1.0,65,zup
"Based on the provided examples, here is the apparent rule for the meaning of ""zup"":

**Rule:**
- zup -> yellow

Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" is produced in the output. There appears to be no variation in the meaning of ""zup"" regardless of its position or the context within the series of words. Thus, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""",1.0,65,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each occurrence of the word ""zup"" in the input is translated to the word ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,65,zup
"Based on the examples given, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" is consistently mapped to the output ""yellow."" There is no context in which ""bluf"" leads to a different output in these examples.

Rule: bluf -> yellow",1.0,65,bluf
Rule: bluf -> yellow,1.0,65,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> yellow

The examples all show that whenever the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position of the output.",1.0,65,bluf
Rule: bluf -> yellow,1.0,65,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of bluf, let's find the patterns in the examples:

1. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

2. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

3. Input: zup wif bluf zup
   Output: yellow red red yellow

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

5. Input: zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow yellow red

Looking at these examples, we can see that every time ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output in the position directly corresponding to where ""bluf"" is in the input. This pattern is consistent across all examples and is independent of the other words present. The ""yellow"" in the output does not seem dependent on any conditions other than the appearance of ""bluf.""

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,65,bluf
"The examples provided show a pattern related to the word ""walm"" and the colors following each sentence. It seems that ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the word just before it. To elucidate this:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which produces the color red, so ""red"" is repeated.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""wif,"" which produce the colors green and red respectively, causing those colors to repeat.
3. The third example is similar to the first two, with ""walm"" following ""dax"" and ""wif,"" repeating the related colors.
4. In the fourth example, ""lug"" is the preceding word which outputs blue, and the appearance of ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to repeat.
5. Finally, the fifth example again shows ""walm"" causing the repetition of the preceding word's color, which is green for ""dax.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" could be summarized as:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in an input sequence, the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated in the output sequence.

Thus:

walm -> Induces the repetition of the color related to the preceding word.",1.0,65,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should examine the examples and look for patterns particularly associated with entries containing ""walm."" By analyzing the position and corresponding output, we can infer the rule:

1. In the presence of ""walm,"" the word directly before it appears to determine the color sequence that follows:

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red followed by green(s).
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is blue followed by green(s).
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green followed by green(s).

2. The number of greens that follow seem to match the number of times ""walm"" is present:

- In the first input, ""walm"" is used once, and one green follows the red.
- In the second input, ""walm"" is used twice, and both instances are followed by two greens.
- The third and fourth inputs show that when ""walm"" appears once, it is followed by one green.

Considering these observations, ""walm"" seems to denote a repetition of the color assigned to the word that precedes it.

Rule: walm -> when following a word, causes the output color corresponding to that word to be repeated. The repetition quantity is determined by the number of times ""walm"" appears consecutively.",0.9,65,walm
"To deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm"", let's look at the given examples and their outputs:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

2. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green

3. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

4. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red

5. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green

Observing the outputs related to the word ""walm"", we can derive the following patterns:

- In example 1, ""walm"" is followed by 'red', and all the words before also translate to 'red' except the last word, which is different ('yellow').
- In example 2, ""walm"" is followed by 'green', and the outputs for the words before walm are also 'green', except the word after 'lug' which is 'blue', but it does not affect the second occurrence of 'walm', which still translates to 'green'.
- In example 3, ""walm"" is also followed by 'red', and the previous outputs are 'green', which switches to 'red' right after ""walm"".
- In example 4, ""walm"" is again followed by 'red', and all the previous outputs are 'blue'.
- In example 5, ""walm"" is followed by 'green', and the outputs show a pattern of 'red', 'blue', 'green' leading up to ""walm"".

From these examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat the color of the word immediately prior to ""walm"". So, if the previous word's output is 'red', after ""walm"" it will continue to be 'red'; if it is 'blue', it will continue to be 'blue'; and if it is 'green', it will continue to be 'green' after ""walm"". This rule applies regardless of the colors that came before the word immediately prior to ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> causes the next word to inherit the output color of the word immediately prior to ""walm"".",0.8,65,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the pattern of colors corresponding to each instance of ""walm"" and the words before and after it.

- In all examples where ""walm"" is used, it is followed directly by the word ""wif"" or occurs after ""dax."" In both scenarios, the color following ""walm"" is ""red.""
- Before ""walm,"" the words do not follow a specific pattern and neither do the corresponding colors.

With this information, let's focus on the occurrences of ""walm"":

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- Here, ""walm"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output: green green green red blue green green green
- In this input, we have two instances of ""walm."" The first one corresponds to ""green,"" the next word is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" The second instance of ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" again.

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""green,"" the next word is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red.""

Input: lug walm wif bluf
Output: blue blue blue red red
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue,"" the next word is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red.""

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""green.""

From these observations, it appears that the color associated with ""walm"" is the same as the color associated with the word immediately preceding it:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the color associated with both is ""green.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the color associated with both is ""blue.""
- We do not have an example where ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" but we can observe that ""walm"" never directly precedes ""wif,"" thus breaking the direct linkage pattern.

Based on the consistency of the color matching between ""walm"" and the preceding word, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The meaning of ""walm"" seems to adopt the color of the preceding word. If ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" then ""walm"" is ""green."" If ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" then ""walm"" is ""blue."" If ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" this rule cannot be confirmed with the provided data.",0.8,65,walm
"Based on the given examples, the meaning of ""walm"" seems to relate to the color that follows it in the output sequence. Specifically, the color seems to be repeated a number of times consecutively. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   Here ""wif"" leads to ""red"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green, and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". The term ""walm"" precedes a repetition of ""red"" three times. 

2. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   Here ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red, and ""lug"" to ""blue"". ""Walm"" is followed by ""green"" repeated twice and then ""red"" for a single instance after ""wif"".

3. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"" again and is directly followed by ""walm"", which is then followed by ""green"" repeated thrice. ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" appears to make ""red"" repeated once more.

4. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   ""Lug"" equates to ""blue"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and is succeeded by ""blue"" repeated twice. ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"" which is repeated after ""bluf"".

5. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""dax"" to ""green"". The term ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" and is followed by ""green"" repeated twice.

The rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it indicates a repetition of the color associated with the word that follows it. However, there is no clear pattern in terms of the number of repetitions based on these examples; they aren't consistent. The challenge is to deduce the correct rule, given the inconsistency. One possible consistent observation is that ""walm"" seems to cause the repetition of the next word's corresponding color output at least twice.

Rule: walm -> triggers the repetition of the next word's color in the output by at least two additional times.",0.7,65,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's look at each example and find a common rule that applies.

- Input: wif lug | Output: red blue
- Input: wif bluf lug zup | Output: red red blue yellow
- Input: lug zup dax lug dax | Output: blue yellow green blue green
- Input: zup lug | Output: yellow blue
- Input: zup lug wif | Output: yellow blue red

In each output, ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" There are not enough examples to define ""lug"" as a rule dependent on context or position. It seems consistent that ""lug"" directly translates to the color ""blue,"" irrespective of its position or surrounding words.

Rule:
lug -> blue",1.0,66,lug
"From the examples provided, we can conclude:

- Whenever ""lug"" appears, the word ""blue"" follows in the output.
- ""Lug"" does not depend on its position in the input for its meaning; regardless of where it appears, the output is consistently ""blue.""
- Other words in the examples correspond to their own consistent color outputs. For example, ""wif"" -> ""red,"" ""zup"" -> ""yellow,"" ""dax"" -> ""green.""

Therefore, based on the examples given:

Rule: lug -> ""blue""",1.0,66,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word corresponds to a particular color:

- wif -> red
- bluf -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green

The word ""lug"" always results in the color blue, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,66,lug
"Based on the above examples, the word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" Here is the justification for this conclusion:

- In examples 1, 2, and 4, the presence of ""lug"" corresponds directly to the output of ""blue.""
- In example 3, ""lug"" appears twice and each time it corresponds to the output ""blue.""
- In example 5, ""lug"" also corresponds to the output ""blue,"" and it is irrespective of its position relative to other words.

Therefore:
Rule: lug -> ""blue""",1.0,66,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each instance it appears.",1.0,66,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let’s look for patterns in the given examples. The word ""dax"" must correspond to one of the colors in the output that changes as the context around ""dax"" changes.

Here's what we know:
1. ""dax"" appears in various positions within the input strings (beginning, middle, end).
2. ""dax"" appears before different words (""wif"", ""walm"", ""zup"").
3. Regardless of the position or the surrounding words, ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs.

Given these observations, we can conclude the following:

Rule: When ""dax"" appears in the input, it always corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.

Therefore:

dax -> ""green""",1.0,66,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""dax"" triggers the color ""green"" in the output sequence regardless of its position in the input string. In all instances, when ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Therefore, we can determine the following rule:

Rule: dax -> ""green""",1.0,66,dax
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" generates a specific pattern in the output. To find out what ""dax"" means, we must look at the corresponding output for each instance where ""dax"" appears:

1. dax walm wif lug dax walm -> green green green red blue green green green
   - The first ""dax"" is followed by three greens, and then a red occurs after a non-""dax"" word.
   - The second ""dax"" appears after ""lug"" (which corresponds with blue) and is followed by two greens.

2. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red
   - ""dax"" is followed by a red.

3. zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green green red
   - ""dax"" is preceded by red and followed by green.

4. wif dax wif -> red green red
   - ""dax"" is between two reds but corresponds to green.

5. dax zup -> green yellow
   - ""dax"" is followed by yellow.

From these examples, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the output, regardless of its position in the input or the colors that come before or after it.

Therefore:

dax -> green.",1.0,66,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the meaning of dax appears to be tied to the position of the word relative to other words and possibly the words that follow it. Here is the induction based on the examples:

- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""lug,"" the output is ""red.""
- When ""dax"" stands alone or is followed by a word that hasn't been demonstrated to change its output (like ""zup""), the output is ""green.""

Given these observations, it's possible that ""dax"" generally translates to ""green,"" but certain conditions may cause a change in output, such as when it is followed by or precedes specific words. However, more examples would be needed to develop a comprehensive rule for ""dax"" that captures all the subtleties of its use.

For now, based on the presented examples:

Rule: ""dax"" typically means ""green,"" but can mean ""red"" when followed by ""lug"".",0.8,66,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" by looking at the color outputs associated with its appearance:

1. In the first example, ""dax"" appears twice, and both times it's followed by ""walm"". ""walm"" appears a third time without ""dax"" before it. The positions where ""dax walm"" appear result in ""green green"" and the single ""walm"" results in ""green"". Since the output color associated with “walm” does not change whether ""dax"" is present or not, this implies ""dax"" by itself may correspond to ""green,"" as the color produced is consistent.

2. In the second example, ""dax"" appears once, before ""wif"", producing the output ""green."" ""wif"" by itself produces ""red,"" indicating that ""dax"" is not merely repeating or reflecting the color associated with the next word.

3. The third example again shows ""dax"" right before ""bluf"" with ""green green"" as the output. ""bluf"" on its own corresponds to ""yellow"" in the second example, showing ""dax"" is not a direct replication of the color that follows.

4. The fourth example has ""dax"" sandwiched between ""wif"", with the output sequence ""red green red"". Here again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

5. Finally, the fifth example has ""dax"" followed by ""zup"", resulting in ""green yellow,"" with ""zup"" alone corresponding to ""yellow"" in other examples.

From these observations, the most consistent color associated with ""dax"" irrespective of the word that follows is ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.",0.8,66,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

- Every instance of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red.""
- The other words (lug, dax, zup, walm) correspond to different colors that are consistently translated across examples.

Thus, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,66,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,66,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can see a consistent pattern in which certain input words are translated to specific colors. Here's the breakdown:

- Whenever the word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
- The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue.""
- The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""
- The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""
- The word ""walm"" is only seen once, and it corresponds to ""red"" in that instance, just like ""wif.""

There does not appear to be any context sensitivity in the meaning of ""wif."" It consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it.

Given the data, the rule for ""wif"" is straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red. ""Wif"" means ""red.""",1.0,66,wif

Hence, the rule deduced is that the nonce word ""wif"" means ""red"".",1.0,66,wif

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow.",1.0,66,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,66,zup
"Based on the examples given, it seems that the word ""zup"" does not have a fixed output color but is influenced by its surrounding words. In each example, ""zup"" is associated with a different color:

- In the first example, ""zup"" precedes ""wif"" and the output color is yellow.
- In the second and third examples, ""zup"" is followed by ""lug"" or ""dax"" and the output color is yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" is between ""lug"" and ""dax"" (blue, green) and the output is again yellow.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" is both preceded and followed by ""lug"" (blue) and both instances of ""zup"" maintain the same output of yellow.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" appears after another word, the color associated with that previous word should be repeated in the output.",1.0,66,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to dictate the output color to be repeated but is influenced by the word that immediately precedes it. The repeated color in the output corresponds to the color equivalent of the word before ""bluf."" Here are the equivalents as per the examples:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green

When applying these translations to the examples, we can observe that ""bluf"" causes the previous color word to repeat itself in the output. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before it.

Rule: If a word precedes ""bluf,"" its corresponding color is repeated in the output. If ""bluf"" is the first word, there is no example to deduce its behavior from the provided data.",1.0,66,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's look at the provided examples and the corresponding outputs to identify patterns.

- When ""walm"" is present, the word ""red"" is repeated three times in the output, immediately following the occurrence of ""walm.""
- ""Walm"" does not cause any change in the colors associated with other words; for instance, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" regardless of whether ""walm"" is present or not.
- The presence of ""walm"" does not affect the occurrence of blue for ""lug.""

Considering the above observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be the repetition of the color ""red"" three times.

Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the word ""red"" after its occurrence in the input.",1.0,66,walm
"Based on the examples given, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond to a color pattern. To infer the meaning behind it, let's examine the outputs after each occurrence of ""walm"":

- In Example 1, after ""walm"", the colors are red, red, green, yellow. 
- In Example 2, after ""walm"" by itself, the colors are green, green, green, implying that ""walm"" alone equates to three greens in a row.
- In Example 3, ""walm"" follows two occurrences of ""wif"" and the output sequence post-""walm"" is red, red, red.
- In Example 4, ""walm"" first follows ""wif"" and yields red, red, red, and then after ""lug walm"", the outputs are blue, blue, blue.
- In Example 5, after ""dax walm lug"", the colors are green, green, green, blue.

Based on these observations, it appears that ""walm"" causes the next three colors to repeat the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before ""walm"". When ""walm"" stands alone, as in Example 2, it defaults to ""green"".

Therefore, here's your rule:

Rule: walm -> means repeat the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" three times. If ""walm"" is by itself, repeat ""green"" three times.",1.0,66,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems like the word ""walm"" is translated to ""red red red"" regardless of its position in the input. In all cases, whenever ""walm"" appears, it consistently corresponds to the output ""red red red"".

Rule: walm -> red red red",1.0,66,walm
"To deduce the meaning or the rule for the nonce word ""walm"", let's examine the consistent pattern across the examples provided:

1. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
2. dax walm -> green green green
3. lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red
4. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
5. zup wif dax walm lug -> yellow red green green green blue

From these examples, a pattern emerges that can be related to the output color sequence for ""walm"":

- In every instance where ""walm"" appears, the color green is also in the output.
- Each occurrence of ""walm"" in the input is directly followed by the color green in the output, and this green is always followed by a sequence of the same color repeated for a certain number of times.

It seems that ""walm"" results in an output of green, followed by repeated instances of the color that would be normally associated with the following input word. In cases where ""walm"" is the last word, no color repetition occurs after green.

Hence, we can infer that the rule for ""walm"" is that it produces the color green in the output which then triggers a repetition of the subsequent color that corresponds to the next word in the input sequence. If ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"", which normally corresponds to green, it causes a repetition of green. If ""walm"" is the last word, there is no repetition since there is no subsequent word to influence.

"Based on the given examples, it appears that there is a consistent relationship between the input word ""walm"" and the color output ""red."" Every time the word ""walm"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" appears once or more in the output. Here's the breakdown:

- walm in ""wif walm dax zup"" gives ""red red red,"" indicating 'walm' corresponds to three occurrences of 'red.'
- walm in ""dax walm"" gives ""green green green,"" but considering ""dax"" must be 'green' as well, 'walm' on its own again corresponds to three 'red' as the previous input had ""dax"" with a different color without 'walm.'
- walm in ""lug wif zup wif walm"" has ""red red red"" following 'walm,' consistent with the earlier examples.
- walm in ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" followed by two instances of ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting 'lug' might be 'blue,' and 'walm' remains consistently 'red red red.'
- walm in ""zup wif dax walm lug"" has ""green green green"" following 'walm,' considering ""dax"" is 'green,' we can still deduce 'walm' corresponds to 'red red red.'

Based on these observations, here's the rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" in the input corresponds to ""red red red"" in the output. Thus, walm -> meaning. Meaning: red red red.",0.8,66,walm

"Based on the provided examples, we can see a consistent pattern where the word ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue"" in the output. Regardless of whether ""lug"" is combined with other words or stands alone, the output consistently contains the color ""blue."" Additionally, it appears that ""lug"" may generate the word ""blue"" for each occurrence in the input. Here is the rule that can be inferred:

Rule: ""lug"" -> ""blue""

This rule is supported by the following observations:
- When the input is ""lug zup,"" the output is ""blue yellow,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- For the input ""lug walm dax,"" the output is ""blue blue blue green,"" with the repeated ""blue"" suggesting that both ""lug"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""blue.""
- An input containing only ""lug"" results in an output of just ""blue.""
- When ""wif"" and ""lug"" appear together, as in ""wif lug,"" the output is ""red blue,"" aligning with ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" In every instance where ""wif"" is present, the word ""red"" appears in the output. Thus, the rule appears to be consistent regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the sequence of nonce words.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,67,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" seems to correspond to the color ""red"". Here's a breakdown of how this conclusion was reached:

- When ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red"".
- When ""wif"" appears alongside other words, each instance correlates with an output of ""red"".
- The number of ""red"" outputs matches the number of ""wif"" occurrences within the input.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> ""red""",1.0,67,wif
"Based on the examples given, we can see that the word 'wif' correlates with the color 'red'. Each instance of 'wif' is translated to 'red' in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the meaning of 'wif' can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,67,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" It seems that ""wif"" by itself is simply ""red,"" and when ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" it results in the repetition of the color ""red"" for as many times as the word ""walm"" appears in the input following ""wif.""",1.0,67,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""wif"" likely associates with the output ""red,"" but its effect on adjacent words seems to differ. 

When ""wif"" is followed by a single word:
- ""wif lug"" results in ""red blue"". ""lug"" on its own elsewhere equals ""blue"".
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"". ""walm"" on its own in other examples equals ""green"".

When ""wif"" is followed by multiple words, it seems to add ""red"" before each following word's associated color:
- ""lug wif dax walm zup"" results in ""blue red green green green yellow."" Here, ""red"" appears after ""lug"" and before the colors that correspond to ""dax,"" ""walm,"" and ""zup"" without ""wif"" presence. 
- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" gives ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" After ""wif"", ""red red"" appears. 

However, when ""wif"" stands alone:
- ""wif"" simply results in ""red"".

Given this pattern, ""wif"" seems to generate ""red"" and may potentially repeat its effect on the subsequent word or words when combined, albeit how it repeats or affects the sequence when combined with multiple words after it is not consistently shown in the provided examples.

Therefore, we can conclude the following tentative rule with the information given:

Rule: wif -> Generates ""red"". When followed by other words, may introduce ""red"" preceding each word's associated color, or modify the sequence in a way that isn't clearly delineated by the provided examples.",0.7,67,wif
"Based on the examples provided, zup seems to correspond with a specific color in the output. To deduce the rule for what zup means, let's look at the correlation between the input and output.

In the second example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"" where ""walm"" correlates with the color blue in other examples, but here it is yellow. This suggests that zup is affecting the color of the following word or is setting a pattern that changes the expected color of ""walm.""

Looking at the third example, ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow,"" and since ""lug"" consistently corresponds to blue, we can infer that zup independently results in yellow.

In the other examples, zup precedes the words that normally would correspond to a different color yet results in yellow. For example, ""lug dax zup lug wif"" leads to ""blue green yellow blue red,"" with zup corresponding to yellow once again.

Therefore, the rule seems to be consistent across all examples that zup always results in the color yellow, regardless of the position or the surrounding words. Thus, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,67,zup
"Based on the given examples, it seems like the word ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Each other word in the input corresponds to a specific color as well:

- wif -> red
- walm -> blue
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

Looking at the outputs whenever ""zup"" appears, the resulting color is yellow. This holds true no matter where ""zup"" appears in the sequence or how many times it appears. From the examples provided:

- ""zup walm"" -> yellow yellow yellow (consistent for zup and walm)
- ""lug zup"" -> blue yellow (consistent for lug and zup)
- ""lug dax zup lug wif"" -> blue green yellow blue red (again, consistent for each input corresponding to the right color)
- ""zup lug zup lug wif"" -> yellow blue yellow blue red (zup consistently outputs yellow)

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow",1.0,67,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" translates to a specific color in the output. To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to look at the corresponding output in each instance where ""zup"" is used.

In the examples provided:

- In the first example, the sequence ""dax zup wif"" translates to ""red green yellow red,"" which suggests that ""zup"" could be ""green"" when following ""dax,"" but ""yellow"" in other instances.
- In the second example, ""zup walm"" is translated as ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" on its own or followed by ""walm"" translates to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""lug zup"" gives ""blue yellow,"" showing ""zup"" following ""lug"" is ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax zup lug wif"" gives ""green yellow blue red,"" which means ""zup"" following ""dax"" is ""yellow"" in this instance as well. This contradicts our first point, implying that ""zup"" does not depend on what precedes it.
- The fifth and final example ""zup lug zup lug wif"" once again translates to ""yellow blue yellow blue red,"" consistent with ""zup"" being ""yellow"" in all cases.

From these observations, we can establish a rule:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow,"" irrespective of the context in which it is used.

Thus: zup -> yellow.",1.0,67,zup
"The examples provided suggest that ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color in the output. Each input word appears to be associated with a specific color:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

However, in the examples, ""zup"" always results in ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position or the context within the sequence.

Rule:
zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,67,zup
"Based on the pattern observed in the examples, it appears that ""zup"" correlates to a color change in the pattern. The specific rules are not absolutely clear, but it seems that each word corresponds to a specific color, and ""zup"" triggers the next color in a sequence. Here is the rule based on each word's corresponding color:

- wif -> red
- walm -> blue
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

Using these correspondences, ""zup"" seems to change the output to the next color in a sequence that we can partly infer:

From first input:
- Before ""zup"": red red red (wif walm dax)
- After ""zup"": green yellow red (wif lug walm)

From second input:
- The entire output of ""zup walm"" is yellow, suggesting that ""zup"" independently outputs yellow when no context is provided.

From third input:
- ""lug zup"" gives blue yellow, so here ""zup"" seems to follow ""lug"" with yellow.

From fourth input:
- ""lug dax zup lug wif"" transitions from green to yellow with the introduction of ""zup"".

From the fifth input:
- The pattern ""lug zup lug wif"" gives us blue yellow blue red, so in this context, ""zup"" is followed by blue.

Finally, reviewing all the patterns, ""zup"" seems to turn to yellow whenever it is introduced regardless of the preceding color, except for when it is preceded by ""lug"", where it's not affecting the output color. This could be due to a specific interaction between ""lug"" and ""zup"".

Thus, the generalized rule could be that ""zup"" changes the output to yellow unless it directly follows ""lug,"" where it has no effect on altering the color. However, without a more comprehensive set of examples, it's not possible to fully determine the exact rule. Based on the examples given, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> changes output to yellow, unless it directly follows ""lug"", where it has no effect.",0.7,67,zup
"Based on the recurring patterns in the input and output examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" is consistently associated with the color ""yellow"". Each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the color ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output.

Hence, the rule is:

bluf -> yellow",1.0,67,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it can be observed that whenever the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green"". The presence of ""bluf"" consistently results in ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present. Hence, it can be inferred that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green.

Rule: bluf -> green",1.0,67,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to ""green"". To confirm this observation, I will check each instance where ""bluf"" is used and analyze the output.

1. When ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"" both in (input: dax bluf wif lug zup; output: green green red blue yellow) and in (input: wif dax bluf; output: red green green), ""bluf"" results in ""green"".
2. When ""bluf"" is the second word such as in (input: zup bluf; output: yellow yellow) and (input: zup bluf wif dax lug; output: yellow yellow red green blue), ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""green"".
3. When ""bluf"" is the third word as in (input: wif zup bluf wif dax; output: red yellow yellow red green), it still results in ""green"".

Regardless of its position in the sequence, ""bluf"" consistently correlates with the output ""green"".

Rule: bluf -> green.",1.0,67,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Here is the rule based on the given inputs and outputs:

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" represents the color green in this context. Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the color green is used in the corresponding position in the output.",0.0,67,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that 'bluf' represents the color green. The clues from the outputs consistently show a green output when 'bluf' is present in the input, irrespective of its position in the sequence. Additionally, when 'bluf' appears multiple times, the color green is repeated.

Rule: bluf -> green.",0.0,67,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word for as many times as the preceding word has syllables. For example:

1. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow (because ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow and has one syllable)
2. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red (because ""lug"" has one syllable, and ""lug"" corresponds to blue)
3. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> red red green green red red red blue red (the ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which is associated with red and has one syllable, so it repeats the color red once)

Given this pattern, the rule for ""walm"" can be deduced as:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word the number of times equal to the number of syllables in that word.

So:
walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated according to the number of syllables in the previous word.",1.0,67,walm
"From the given examples, it appears that the output color corresponds to the input word, with each unique word associated with a unique color. Here is what can be inferred from the examples:

- Each occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- Each occurrence of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- Each occurrence of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- Each occurrence of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- The word ""walm"" results in the same color as the word that immediately follows it.
- The word ""bluf"" is not directly shown in the outputs, but given the pattern, it's reasonable to assume it corresponds to ""green"" since it appears before and after ""dax,"" which is associated with ""green.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that follows it. If ""walm"" is at the end of the input and there is no word after it to take the color from, the rule cannot be applied based on the given data.

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the following word.",1.0,67,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze each input and the corresponding output:

1. Input: ""wif walm dax zup""; Output: ""red red red green yellow""
2. Input: ""zup walm""; Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
3. Input: ""zup walm wif""; Output: ""yellow yellow yellow red""
4. Input: ""lug walm zup wif""; Output: ""blue blue blue yellow red""
5. Input: ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif""; Output: ""red red green green red red red blue red""

From these examples, we can infer the following patterns for words other than ""walm"":
- ""wif"" consistently outputs ""red.""
- ""zup"" consistently outputs ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" consistently outputs ""green.""
- ""lug"" consistently outputs ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" seems to output ""green"" immediately after, but in the presence of ""wif"" before it, it outputs ""red.""

Now, specifically analyzing the occurrences of ""walm"":
- In every instance where ""walm"" appears, the output color for ""walm"" is always the same as the color for the word preceding it.

So, it seems like the rule for ""walm"" is to match the color output of the word before it. Thus:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Takes the color of the preceding word (if there's a word before it).

1. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red"" because ""wif"" outputs ""red,"" so ""walm"" also outputs ""red.""
2. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" outputs ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" also outputs ""yellow.""
3. For ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" gives ""blue,"" so ""walm"" also gives ""blue.""
4. When ""walm"" is the first word, and there's no preceding word to take the color from, like in the second example, it defaults to ""yellow,"" as that's the only instance we have of ""walm"" without a previous word color to mimic.

If there's a contradiction or more examples are necessary, please provide additional data.",1.0,67,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the examples:

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red

Input: lug walm zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow red

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

By examining the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can try to identify what ""walm"" might mean:

1. In every example, every word corresponding to ""walm"" has the same color repeated for all words that follow it until a new word appears.
2. The color associated with ""walm"" itself changes depending on the word that follows it.
3. ""Walm"" seems to be a control word that sets the output color for the following words until the control word changes.

From these observations, we can develop a rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the next word's color to repeat for itself and any subsequent words until the control word changes.

Let's apply this rule to the examples:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" which outputs ""green."" Therefore, ""walm"" also outputs ""red,"" the same as the preceding word ""wif.""
- In the second example, there's only ""zup"" after ""walm,"" which outputs ""yellow."" Hence, ""walm"" results in the same color ""yellow"" repeating.
- In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" which results in the color red. So ""walm"" takes on the color ""yellow"" as in the previous word ""zup.""
- The fourth example has ""lug"" after ""walm,"" which is blue, so ""walm"" makes the output ""blue"" until the next word.
- In the fifth example, we see that ""walm"" precedes ""lug,"" which outputs ""blue."" This causes ""walm"" to output ""red,"" matching the color of the previous word ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems consistent across the examples provided.",0.8,67,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" when it is used, corresponds to the color red. 

Based on the patterns given in each input-output pair, it seems that the presence of ""walm"" directly affects the color outcome for the words that follow it until a new word (that is not ""wif"" or ""walm"" itself) appears. The word immediately following ""walm"" is colored red, as well as subsequent instances of the word ""wif"" until another distinct word breaks the pattern. This can be inferred from the fact that in the first input, the word ""wif"" following ""walm"" is red, and in the last input, the word sequence ""wif walm lug wif"" results in the output ""red red blue red"", with ""wif"" before and after ""walm"" both being red.

lug -> meaning: The word ""lug"" means ""blue.""

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue.""",1.0,68,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look for the pattern in the relationship between the input and output sequences.

From the examples:
1. When ""wif dax"" appears, the output is ""red green"".
2. When ""dax zup bluf"" appears, the output is ""green yellow yellow"".
3. When ""zup dax bluf"" appears, the output is ""yellow green green"".

It seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output, regardless of the words that come before or after it in the input.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green.",1.0,68,dax
"Using the information provided from the examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule behind the word ""dax"" by looking at the patterns before and after the word's appearance in the input and their respective outputs.

Here's what we can see:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the same position in the output.
2. It does not appear that ""dax"" affects the color output of other words around it, as there is no consistent change in the surrounding colors when ""dax"" is present or absent.
3. ""Dax"" doesn't seem to depend on its position in the sequence, as its presence always translates to ""green,"" no matter where it is placed in the input.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""dax"" correlates directly with the color output ""green."" Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,68,dax
"Upon examining the given examples, we can try to understand the relationship between the input words and the colors in the output. In each output string, the color corresponding to the input word ""dax"" is green.

Here, ""dax"" is associated with green.

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
Again, ""dax"" corresponds to green at the beginning of the sequence.

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow
Once more, ""dax"" equates to green at the start.

Input: wif dax
Output: red green
In this short pair, ""dax"" follows ""wif"" and translates to green.

Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
Here, ""dax"" is the second word, and once again, it matches up with green.

Considering that ""dax"" consistently aligns with the color green in the output, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,68,dax
"To induce the rule of what the nonce word ""dax"" means based on the examples provided, let's look closely at the mapping of the inputs to their corresponding outputs.

Observations:
- In each instance where ""zup"" appears, the output color is yellow.
- ""Zup"" does not correspond to the same color as any other word (e.g., ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"").
- The position of ""zup"" does not seem to affect the output color (it is always yellow regardless of where ""zup"" is in the sentence).

"By analyzing the given examples, we can try to determine the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf"". Let's examine each instance where ""bluf"" appears and the corresponding output:

1. wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue
2. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
3. dax bluf wif lug zup -> green green red blue yellow
4. wif bluf -> red red
5. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow

In every instance, the word just before ""bluf"" is replicated in the output; the color associated with that word is repeated:

1. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""red"" is repeated before ""bluf"".
2. There is no word before ""bluf"" repeated in this case, but the pattern of the other colors is consistent.
3. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""green"" is repeated before ""bluf"".
4. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""red"" is repeated before ""bluf"".
5. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""green"" is repeated before ""bluf"".

Considering these patterns, it seems that ""bluf"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the word right before it.

Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the word before ""bluf"" is repeated in the output.",1.0,68,bluf
"The examples provided consistently show that whenever the nonce word ""bluf"" appears, the word ""red"" follows in the output. 

- For the first input ""wif bluf dax lug,"" the output is ""red red green blue,"" and ""red"" directly follows ""bluf.""
- In the second input ""zup lug zup bluf lug,"" ""yellow"" comes after ""lug"" and ""zup,"" but ""red"" follows ""bluf.""
- The third input ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" outputs ""green green red blue yellow,"" again with ""red"" following ""bluf.""
- The fourth input ""wif bluf"" simplifies the pattern to just ""red red,"" showing a direct correspondence.
- Lastly, the fifth input ""dax bluf wif zup"" produces ""green green red yellow,"" with ""red"" once more following ""bluf.""

Therefore, the rule is:

"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in every instance except when it is positioned immediately before ""lug,"" in which case ""bluf lug"" translates to ""green blue.""

However, if we look at the sequences that do not include ""lug"" immediately after ""bluf,"" we note that ""bluf"" translates to ""red."" The exception to this rule occurs when ""bluf"" precedes ""lug."" To confirm the rule, we will check all instances where ""bluf"" does not precede ""lug"":

- Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
- Input: dax bluf wif -> Output: green green red
- Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
- Input: dax bluf wif zup -> Output: green green red yellow

In these cases, ""bluf"" translates to ""red."" Now let's look at the cases where ""bluf"" precedes ""lug"":

- Input: wif bluf dax lug -> Output: red red green blue
- Input: zup lug zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
- Input: dax bluf wif lug zup -> Output: green green red blue yellow

In these cases, ""bluf lug"" translates to ""green blue.""

Therefore, the rule is: ""bluf"" means ""red"" unless it immediately precedes ""lug,"" in which case ""bluf lug"" translates to ""green blue.""

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the word immediately before it.",1.0,68,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first take a look at the corresponding outputs for each given input and analyze the patterns:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" seems to correspond with ""yellow"" in this context
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" might correspond to ""red"" since the remaining ""red"" in the output has no other word to match.

2. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""yellow"" since there's an extra ""yellow"" in the output that isn't paired with any other word.

3. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" might correspond to ""blue"" since the extra ""blue"" in the output is not paired with any other word.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""yellow"" as well since there's an additional ""yellow"" in the output.

5. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" might correspond to ""green"" given the extra ""green"" in the output that isn't paired with any other word.

Based on the above analysis, ""walm"" appears to duplicate the color of the preceding word. In example 1, ""wif"" is red and ""walm"" results in additional reds. In example 2, ""zup"" is yellow and ""walm"" adds more yellow. In example 3, ""lug"" is blue and ""walm"" results in extra blues. The pattern continues for examples 4 and 5, too.

Rule:
walm -> duplicates the color of the immediately preceding word.",1.0,68,walm
"To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the common patterns in the examples provided.

Looking at examples where ""walm"" appears, the output is always a repetition of a color. The color that is repeated is the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm.""

Let's look at each example:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm 
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""Wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is three ""red,"" which is the color associated with ""wif.""

2. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   - ""Zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is three ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup.""

3. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - ""Lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is three ""blue,"" the color for ""lug.""

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - Only ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" resulting in three ""yellow,"" the color tied to ""zup.""

5. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   - ""Dax"" precedes ""walm,"" so the output is three ""green,"" the color associated with ""dax."" Note that the word following ""walm"" does not have an influence on the output.

From these patterns, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output to be a repetition of three instances of the color linked to the word that comes immediately before ""walm.""

Therefore,

walm -> meaning: a command that repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,68,walm
"Analyzing the given examples, I'll evaluate the potential meaning or rule governing the use of the nonce word ""walm"".

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"". However, elsewhere, ""wif"" is translated as a single ""red"", which suggests that ""walm"" may be responsible for the repetition.
- In the second example, ""walm dax zup"" corresponds to ""yellow green yellow"". Since ""dax"" and ""zup"" translate to ""green"" and ""yellow"", respectively, the inclusion of ""walm"" did not alter their colors, it only repeated the color ""yellow"" that corresponds to ""zup"".
- The third example, ""lug walm dax"", translates to ""blue blue blue green"". ""Lug"" is ""blue"", and ""dax"" is ""green"", suggesting that ""walm"" caused the repetition of the color preceding it, ""blue"".
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"", indicating that ""walm"" caused ""yellow"" to be repeated thrice.
- The fifth example, ""dax walm wif"", shows ""green green green red"". ""Dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red"", suggesting that ""walm"" again caused the repetition of ""green"" before ""wif"" is mentioned.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it. Thus, the word that precedes ""walm"" is said three times before the next color is mentioned.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color word three times before continuing.",0.8,68,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the input-output relationships in the provided examples.

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

2. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

3. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red

Analyzing the repeating colors:

- For input ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- For input ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- For input ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
- For input ""dax,"" the output is often ""green.""

Based on the examples, it can be observed that when ""walm"" follows a word, the output is a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, except when ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" to which the color ""green"" is added before the repeating color.

Rule:
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is repeated ""yellow.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is repeated ""red.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is repeated ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is one ""green"" followed by repeated ""green"" which was the observed color for ""dax.""

The rule exhibits that ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be repeated for however many times ""walm"" would imply based on its position or the context. However, when following ""dax,"" ""walm"" seems to both honor the repetition rule and add an extra instance of ""dax""'s associated color, leading to ""green green green"" (when ""walm"" follows ""dax""). The additional ""green"" indicates that ""walm"" could imply a doubling effect of the color related to the immediate preceding word.

2. ""wif"" alone results in ""red"".
3. ""wif walm dax"" results in ""red red red green"". Here, 'wif' results in 'red', 'walm' also results in 'red', and 'dax' results in 'green'.

- In the first example, ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red."" Since ""lug"" represents ""blue"" and ""wif"" represents ""red,"" ""bluf"" in this context could correspond to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue."" This suggests that when ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (which means ""blue""), ""bluf"" also means ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow."" ""Dax"" stands for ""green"" and ""zup"" for ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" here takes on the meaning of ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" translates to ""green green red yellow blue."" This further supports the idea that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the preceding word.
- The fifth example, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" translates to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" Whenever ""bluf"" follows a color word, it takes the color of that preceding word.

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Therefore, the meaning is:

bluf -> meaning. The nonce word ""bluf"" represents a color, and the specific color it takes on depends on the color word that comes immediately before it in a sequence.

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" there is no ""bluf"" preceded by ""wif"" alone, but considering the context of other examples, it may suggest that ""bluf"" takes the color associated with the word preceding it.

"Rule: The word 'bluf' takes the color of the word that precedes it. If no word precedes 'bluf', then 'bluf' takes the color blue. If the word following 'bluf' is 'wif,' then 'bluf' will repeat the color of the preceding word.

- ""lug wif bluf"" -> The word 'lug' indicates blue, followed by 'wif,' which seems to prompt a repeat of the color, thus 'bluf' here means red because it follows 'wif,' which came after 'lug' (blue).
- ""lug bluf"" -> 'Bluf' follows 'lug' which is blue, so 'bluf' is blue.
- ""dax zup bluf"" -> The 'bluf' follows 'zup', which corresponds to yellow, so 'bluf' is yellow.
- ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" -> 'Bluf' follows 'dax' which is green, then it comes before 'wif' so 'bluf' repeats the same color (green), not influencing the following colors.
- ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" -> 'Bluf' takes the color of 'lug,' which is blue, before and after the 'wif'. 'Walm' does not seem to directly influence the color of 'bluf', but rather introduces a new color (red) when followed by 'lug'.

"Based on the provided examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be associated with the output ""red red red.""

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be:

walm -> red red red",1.0,69,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs, observing the behavior concerning the position of ""walm"" and comparing it with the associated colors.

In inputs where ""walm"" appears:
- When ""dax"" is before ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green."" Since ""dax"" by itself is not shown in the other examples, it's difficult to deduce its meaning, but the repetition of ""green"" could indicate that ""walm"" is also related to ""green.""
- In the second example, ""wif walm dax zup"" produces ""red red red green yellow,"" and since ""zup"" alone correlates to ""yellow,"" it's probable that ""walm"" is contributing to the ""red"" output since ""wif"" appears both times it is used.
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red."" We can see ""zup"" leading to ""yellow"" again, and ""walm"" could be producing the repeating ""red"" as the last color.
- ""zup lug walm wif walm"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue red red red."" Here, ""lug"" seems to correlate with ""blue,"" ""zup"" continues to produce ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" seems to affect the sequence of ""red.""
- Finally, ""zup wif walm"" gives us ""yellow red red red."" ""Zup"" is consistent with ""yellow,"" and again, ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of ""red.""

From the patterns observed, it appears that ""walm"" produces a sequence of three ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. The presence of ""walm"" seems to be directly linked to the repetition of the color ""red"" three times.

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" triggers the output of ""red red red"" in a sequence. When ""walm"" appears in the input, it should be translated to three consecutive ""red"" in the output. 

Therefore, walm -> red red red.",1.0,69,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the outputs in each of the given examples where the word ""walm"" is used and find the common pattern.

3. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
4. zup lug walm wif walm -> yellow blue blue blue red red red
5. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red

From these examples, whenever ""walm"" is mentioned, the output is a series of reds. The count of reds seems to be increasing by one each time ""walm"" is mentioned within the same input, with the following exceptions in the output:

- When ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" an additional green is produced.
- When ""zup"" is present in the input, regardless of its position to ""walm,"" the output starts with a yellow.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" prompts one more red in the output sequence than the previous number of reds. If ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" an additional green is output after the reds.

Using this rule, we get:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: If ""walm"" appears in the input, count the number of reds in the output sequence from the previous appearance of ""walm"" and output that count plus one. If ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" include an additional green after the red sequence.

Hence:
walm -> results in an output of reds, incrementing in count based on the previous number of reds seen after the last ""walm."" If ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" add a green after the reds.",0.8,69,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repeating pattern of the word ""red."" The repetition of ""red"" corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" appears in the input.

For the examples given:

- In ""dax walm,"" the output is ""green green green."" The color ""green"" doesn't seem to correlate directly with the presence of ""walm"" here, as ""dax"" is yielding ""green"" as well.
- In ""wif walm dax zup,"" the output is ""red red red green yellow."" The word ""walm"" appears once, therefore ""red"" appears three times following ""wif.""
- In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow red red red."" Here again, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and is associated with three reds in sequence.
- In ""zup lug walm wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow blue blue blue red red red"" first for ""zup lug walm,"" and then again three ""red""s for the second ""wif walm.""
- In ""zup wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow red red red,"" with the ""wif walm"" part of the input yielding three ""red""s once more.

"Based on the given examples, ""wif"" can be deduced to correlate with the color ""red."" 

In each instance where ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" is present in the corresponding output:

- Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red (bluf correlates with red, suggesting ""red"" is carried over or ""bluf"" is also associated with red)
- Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> Output: red green red red yellow red (dax correlates with green, bluf correlates with red, and zup correlates with yellow; each occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds with red)
- Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue (lug correlates with blue)
- Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow (zup correlates with yellow)
- Input: lug wif dax walm zup -> Output: blue red green green green yellow (lug correlates with blue, wif with red once again, dax with green, and the pattern suggests walm also correlates with green, and zup again with yellow)

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

3. zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup -> yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
4. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green
5. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow

In all examples, the presence of the word ""bluf"" leads to the output ""yellow"" immediately following the color that corresponds to the word preceding ""bluf."" Furthermore, it seems that ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the color that comes right before it. Let's break down one example to confirm this:

Input: lug zup bluf dax
Output: blue yellow yellow green

Here, when ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" the presence of ""bluf"" after ""zup"" results in another ""yellow,"" indicating it repeats the previous color. We can apply this pattern to the other examples and find that it fits:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and the output is another ""green.""
- In example 3, ""bluf"" appears twice, and in both cases, it follows ""zup"" (which is ""yellow""), leading to ""yellow"" being repeated.

   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and the output is ""green"" immediately after ""green.""

2. Input: dax lug wif bluf

3. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" replicates the color associated with the preceding word for a certain number of times. More specifically, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word three times. Here's the rule derived from the examples:

- ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" we get ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- ""wif"" is associated with red, and when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" we get ""red red red.""
- ""lug"" is associated with blue, and when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" we get ""blue blue blue.""
- ""dax"" is associated with green, and when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" we get ""green green green.""

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" can be interpreted as follows:

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.",1.0,70,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it, until a new word is encountered. 

Explanation:
- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" as ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes this color to be repeated.
- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" repeating the ""blue"" associated with ""lug.""
- In the example ""dax walm wif lug dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""walm"" causes ""green"" to repeat until a new word is introduced (""wif""), changing the color output to ""red"". Once ""lug"" is encountered, the output changes to ""blue,"" and after the second ""dax,"" it's followed by ""walm"" again, causing ""green"" to repeat.

Therefore:
walm -> Causes the repetition of the color associated with the previous word until a new color word is encountered.",1.0,70,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" is used to repeat the color associated with the preceding word. Here's the breakdown:

- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow""; thus, ""zup"" represents the color yellow and ""walm"" repeats this color twice.
- ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red,"" suggesting ""wif"" is red and ""walm"" again repeats the color twice.
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" indicating ""lug"" stands for blue and ""walm"" repeats it twice.
- ""dax walm"" in the last example, changes the pattern slightly as it produces ""green green green red blue green green green."" Here, ""dax"" is associated with green, and it's followed by two greens, but then ""wif"" and ""lug"" are inserted, each followed by their respective colors, after which ""dax walm"" repeats with three greens instead of two. This suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word it follows, but the number of repetitions is not consistent across the examples.

However, considering ""walm"" always repeats the color of the word that precedes it at least twice, and that the number of repetitions might vary but is at least two, the rule could be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word at least twice.",0.9,70,walm
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. All other words in the examples also appear to correlate with specific colors, with ""wif"" correlating to ""red,"" ""dax"" correlating to ""green,"" ""walm"" correlating to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" correlating to ""yellow."" It is important to note that ""walm"" also corresponds to ""blue,"" but ""lug"" consistently translates as ""blue"" in every example. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,71,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each instance of the word ""lug"" correlates directly to the color ""blue"" in the output. Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" is the corresponding output color.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" appears to be:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,71,lug
"Analyzing the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""lug.""

In the first example:
- wif dax wif lug wif -> red green red blue red
Here, ""lug"" appears between two occurrences of ""wif,"" which in all instances, except the one including ""lug,"" translates to ""red."" Hence, in this case, ""lug"" is translated to ""blue.""

In the second example:
- lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
Here, ""lug"" appears at the beginning and translates to ""blue.""

In the third example:
- dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue
Here, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" and after ""lug,"" the translation for ""walm"" changes from ""green"" to ""blue.""

In the fourth example:
- wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue
""lug"" appears at the end, after ""dax,"" and translates to ""blue.""

In the fifth example:
- dax zup lug -> green yellow blue

"dax -> green

Rule: Each time the nonce word ""dax"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.",1.0,71,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each unique word is associated with a specific color. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" translates to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""red."" The nonce word ""wif"" seems to always translate to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,71,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

- When the nonce word ""wif"" follows other words, it results in the output ""red"" plus the sequence of colors that correspond to the words before it, in opposite order.
- Every word seems to be associated with a color (e.g., ""dax""=green, ""walm""=red, ""zup""=yellow), and the occurrence of ""wif"" triggers the repetition of these colors in reverse.

Let's verify this with the examples given:

1. ""dax lug wif walm"" results in ""green blue red red red""
  - Applying the rule, ""wif"" would output ""red green blue"", because ""dax"" is green, and ""lug"" is blue (inferred), and these are reversed after ""wif"". Combined with ""walm"" which is red, it results in ""green blue red red red"".

2. ""zup dax wif"" results in ""yellow green red""
  - Here, ""wif"" outputs ""red green yellow"" reversed from ""zup"" (yellow) and ""dax"" (green), but the order is given as ""yellow green red"".

3. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red""
  - ""wif"" by itself outputs a red, and ""walm"" is red. According to our rule, there's no word before ""wif"" to reverse, so the output of ""wif"" here is just ""red"", followed by the red for ""walm"".

4. ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" results in ""yellow green yellow green red red""
  - The pattern before ""wif"" is ""yellow green yellow green"". Applying our rule for ""wif"", it should give us ""red green yellow green yellow"", which indeed reverberates the colors in the reverse order. ""Bluf"" is presumably translated to ""red"".

5. ""dax walm wif dax"" results in ""green green green red green""
  - The words ""dax walm"" before ""wif"" are associated with ""green red"". Reversing this sequence and adding ""red"" from ""wif"" we get ""red green green"". Since another ""dax"" follows ""wif"", it is green, making the full sequence ""green green green red green"".

Based on these observations, we can formulate the following rule for ""wif"":

wif -> meaning: Produces an output of ""red"" followed by reflecting the sequence of colors in reverse order from the existing sequence just before ""wif"".

Rule: If ""wif"" is preceded by words, then translate each word to its corresponding color and reverse this sequence, adding ""red"" before it. If no words precede ""wif"", output ""red"". If words follow ""wif"", just convert them into their respective colors as normal.",1.0,71,wif

- zup -> yellow
- walm -> red
- bluf -> red (assumption based on last example where bluf appears twice and outputs red red)

4. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax

5. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
   Output: green green red blue yellow

In examples 1 and 3, ""zup bluf"" consistently outputs ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow."" However, in example 4 we see ""bluf"" outputs ""red,"" and in example 5, ""green."" This inconsistency suggests that ""bluf"" doesn't translate directly to ""yellow."" We need to consider other possibilities.

Let's compare example 1 with examples 4 and 5. In example 4, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" and ""lug,"" with ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and the output is ""green red,"" showing ""bluf"" as ""red."" In example 5, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" with ""green"" as output and followed by ""wif"" and ""lug,"" corresponding respectively with ""red"" and ""blue"" in the output. From these observations, we can infer that ""bluf"" has an output color that's not directly represented in its input context.

Now, let's consider the patterns where ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"":

- Input: zup bluf
  Output: yellow yellow

""Zup"" may or may not influence the meaning of ""bluf"" in these cases because they seem to produce the same output color – ""yellow."" However, this doesn't provide enough information to deduce the behavior of ""bluf"" in conjunction with ""zup,"" as it could be coincidental.

Taking into account that ""bluf"" results in different colors, the rule for ""bluf"" could be that it either:

1. Translates to the next color in a sequence unknown from the given examples (i.e., following some form of pattern or sequence that's not clear), or
2. Translates to a color based on its context within the input string (i.e., dependent on surrounding words or the position of the word).

Since there is not enough consistent evidence to deduce a clear pattern or rule for ""bluf,"" we could consider that ""bluf"" might take on the next color in the sequence, reacting to the previous color mentioned before it:

- When following ""zup,"" it is ""yellow""
- When following ""dax"" and ""lug,"" it is ""red""
- When following ""dax"" alone, it is ""green""

If ""bluf"" indeed reacts to the previous color mentioned, the rule could be that ""bluf"" represents a color change based on its immediate context, although with the available information, we cannot establish a clear rule for this transformation. However, we do have instances where it's ""yellow,"" ""red,"" and ""green.""

Based on the logical analysis of the given data, we can guess that the rule may involve some form of contextual relationship or sequence, but we would need more examples or information to determine a precise rule.

Rule: bluf -> represents a color that seems to change based on the context or sequence in the input, but with insufficient data to define a clear rule.",0.3,71,bluf
"Based on the examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes ""walm."" Each non-walm word appears to correspond to a particular color: ""lug"" to blue, ""wif"" to red, ""dax"" to green, and ""zup"" to yellow. 

The number of times the color is repeated corresponds to the number of non-walm words in the input before ""walm."" For instance, in ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" represents blue, and there is one instance of ""lug,"" so the output is ""blue"" repeated once. In ""wif lug walm,"" there are two words before ""walm,"" so the color corresponding to ""lug"" (blue) is repeated twice. 

The rule for ""walm"" would then be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the directly preceding word to be repeated an amount of times equal to the number of non-walm words before ""walm.""

So, walm -> meaning would be:

walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word for the number of words before ""walm"".",1.0,71,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" instructs us to repeat the color associated with the previous word in the input three times in the output. Let's analyze the evidence:

1. ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"". ""Lug"" seems to be associated with blue, and ""walm"" caused the word ""blue"" to be repeated three times.

2. ""wif lug walm"" results in ""red blue blue blue"". This indicates that ""wif"" is associated with red, and ""lug"" with blue. Following ""lug,"" ""walm"" again causes the color blue to be repeated three times.

3. ""lug wif dax walm zup"" corresponds to ""blue red green green green yellow"". Here, ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" which seems associated with the color green, and as the rule suggests, green is repeated three times after ""dax.""

4. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""Zup"" seems to be associated with yellow, and ""walm"" again repeats the color yellow three times.

5. ""wif walm dax zup"" corresponds to ""red red red green yellow"". Here, ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""wif"" (red) three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,71,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe the following patterns:

- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue"".
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red"".
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green"".
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow"".

When the word ""walm"" is present, the output seems to consist of repetitions of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm"". Moreover, the number of repetitions matches the number of words appearing before ""walm"" in the input. For example:

- In ""lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and there's one occurrence of ""lug"" before ""walm"", resulting in one ""blue"" being repeated three times in the output.
- In ""wif lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue, there are two words before ""walm"", hence ""blue"" is repeated four times in the output (with the first word ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"").
- In ""lug wif dax walm zup"", ""dax"" corresponds to green, and there are three words before ""walm"", thus ""green"" is repeated three times in the output followed by ""yellow"" for ""zup"".

Therefore, the rule could be stated as:

Walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" as many times as the number of words before ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Output: blue blue blue
Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" indicates that ""blue"" should be repeated three times.

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" indicates that ""blue"" should be repeated immediately afterward three times, as there are three ""blue"" in a row following ""red.""

Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow
Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" indicates that ""green"" should be repeated immediately afterward three times, finishing with ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" indicates that ""yellow"" should be repeated three times.

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" indicates that ""red"" should be repeated immediately afterward three times, followed by ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and then ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" results in the preceding word's corresponding color being repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> replicates the color corresponding to the previous word in the sequence three times.",1.0,71,walm
"According to the examples provided:

- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue""
- ""wif lug walm"" translates to ""red blue blue blue""
- ""lug wif dax walm zup"" translates to ""blue red green green green yellow""
- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow""

We can infer the following rules for the word ""walm"":
1. The output for ""walm"" is a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it.
2. The number of repetitions is equal to the number of colors that have been mentioned in the input before ""walm.""

Thus:

- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" hence ""walm"" means ""repeat blue,"" resulting in ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""wif lug walm,"" ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" Thus, ""walm"" means ""repeat the last color mentioned (blue) one more time than the number of colors mentioned so far (red, blue),"" resulting in ""blue blue blue blue.""
- In ""lug wif dax walm zup,"" the sequence is blue(red), red(blue), green(green), so ""walm"" after ""dax"" means ""repeat the last color mentioned (green) one more time than the number of colors mentioned so far (blue, red, green),"" resulting in ""green green green.""
- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" means ""repeat yellow,"" giving us ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In ""wif walm dax zup,"" we see that ""wif"" means ""red,"" so ""walm"" here means ""repeat the last color mentioned (red) one more time than the number of colors mentioned so far (red),"" leading to ""red red red.""

Therefore, the rule is:

walm -> Repeat the last color mentioned, one additional time per color that has been mentioned before.",1.0,71,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" directly corresponds to the color blue in the output, regardless of context.",1.0,72,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" appears to consistently translate to the color ""blue"". In every example, regardless of the other words present, every time ""lug"" is mentioned, ""blue"" is in the output.",1.0,72,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue regardless of its position or repetition within the sequence.",1.0,72,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: Based on the provided examples, whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it consistently corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output. It does not change meaning regardless of its position or the other words around it.",1.0,72,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: 'lug' translates to the color 'blue'. Whenever 'lug' appears in the input, 'blue' is included in the output.",1.0,72,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" correlates to the color ""green."" To support this conclusion, let's break down each example:

- In the first example, ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green."" Since ""lug"" is consistently associated with ""blue"" in other examples, it suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
  
- In the second example, ""zup lug dax"" translates to ""yellow blue green."" Here, ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""dax"" appears at the end again aligned with ""green.""

- The third example, ""wif dax zup wif,"" translates to ""red green yellow red."" We can recognize ""wif"" as ""red"" and ""zup"" as ""yellow."" The placement of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

- In the fourth example, ""wif dax lug"" translates to ""red green blue."" ""wif"" stands for ""red,"" ""lug"" for ""blue,"" and by elimination, ""dax"" is ""green.""

- Finally, the fifth example, ""dax lug wif,"" translates to ""green blue red."" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" which leaves ""dax"" as ""green.""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,72,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color. When the word ""dax"" is used in a sequence, the color ""green"" is produced in the corresponding position in the output sequence. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,72,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

The rule seems to be that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" This can be concluded by looking at where ""dax"" appears in the input and noticing that ""green"" always appears in the same relative position in the output.",1.0,72,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" represents the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,72,dax
"Based on the provided examples, dax appears to correspond consistently to the color green. Here is the breakdown according to each example:

1. lug dax -> blue green (Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""dax"" to green)
2. zup lug dax -> yellow blue green (Here, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, and ""dax"" to green)
3. wif dax zup wif -> red green yellow red (Here, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" to green, and ""zup"" to yellow)
4. wif dax lug -> red green blue (Here, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" to green, and ""lug"" to blue)
5. dax lug wif -> green blue red (Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" to blue, and ""wif"" to red)

Each instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,72,dax
"Given the examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds with the color ""red."" In each instance where ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" corresponds to it in the output.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,72,wif
"From the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule for ""wif"" based on the positions and output colors.

In all instances where ""wif"" appears:
- It is followed by a red in the output sequence.

By looking at the context in which ""wif"" appears:
- When ""wif"" is followed by a word (like ""bluf"" or ""lug""), it still outputs red.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""dax walm"" or is followed by ""lug,"" it does not seem to affect the output associated with the succeeding words, as ""dax walm"" consistently outputs green green green, and ""lug"" outputs blue when at the beginning of the input.

This indicates that ""wif"" might represent red regardless of its position or the context of surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,72,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. There are no examples provided where ""wif"" leads to a different color, so the simplest conclusion is that ""wif"" translates directly to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,72,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,72,wif
"From the examples given, we can analyze the color outputs in relation to the presence of the nonce word ""wif"".

Here's a breakdown of each input:

1. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" gives ""green green green red blue green green green"". The word ""wif"" precedes ""lug"", and this results in ""red blue"".

2. ""wif bluf dax walm"" provides ""red red green green green"". ""Wif"" appears before ""bluf"" and results in ""red red"".

3. ""lug wif"" leads to ""blue red"". ""Wif"" comes after ""lug"", and we have ""blue red"".

4. ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red"". ""Wif"" comes after ""zup"" but before ""bluf"", which gives ""yellow red red"".

5. ""zup wif lug wif"" converts to ""yellow red blue red"". ""Wif"" appears after ""zup"" and before ""lug"", then it appears again at the end, so we have ""yellow red blue red"".

Now let's deduce the rule:
- Whenever ""wif"" appears, it is followed by the color ""red"" in the output.
- The word ""wif"" itself does not have a consistent color associated with it since it does not appear as an output color. It seems to influence the color that comes after it.

The rule is: ""wif"" is a modifier that influences the next word to output the color ""red"". The word that directly follows ""wif"" determines what comes before ""red"" in the output sequence. Specifically, ""wif"" triggers the color red to appear after the output color that would normally be associated with the word that follows ""wif"".

Rule: wif -> causes the next word's color representation to be followed by the color ""red"" in the sequence.",0.8,72,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow.""",1.0,72,zup
"Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow."" Therefore:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,72,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,72,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow"". This consistent one-to-one mapping suggests that ""zup"" means ""yellow"".",1.0,72,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow,"" as evidenced in all given examples where the presence of ""zup"" in the input consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,72,zup
"Based on the given examples, it seems that 'bluf' echoes the color indicated by the word that comes before it. Here is how the rule applies:

- dax bluf -> green green (dax corresponds to green, bluf repeats the color)
- lug wif bluf -> blue red red (wif corresponds to red, bluf repeats the color)
- lug dax bluf wif dax -> blue green green red green (dax corresponds to green, bluf repeats the color green)
- zup dax bluf -> yellow green green (dax corresponds to green, bluf repeats the color)
- lug bluf -> blue blue (lug corresponds to blue, bluf repeats the color)

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color of the word before it.",1.0,72,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns in the given examples.

From the first input-output pair (dax bluf -> green green), it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" but it doesn't confirm whether it's related to the word before it or by itself. However, the duplication of the color ""green"" suggests that ""bluf"" might be creating a repetition of the color generated by the preceding word.

The second example (lug wif bluf -> blue red red) shows ""bluf"" following ""wif,"" and the output has ""red red,"" which means that ""bluf"" triggered the duplication of the color associated with ""wif,"" just like it did with ""dax.""

The third example (lug dax bluf wif dax -> blue green green red green) further supports this pattern as ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green,"" which is a repetition of the color associated with ""dax.""

The fourth example (zup dax bluf -> yellow green green) confirms the pattern seen so far, as ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color that corresponds to ""dax.""

The fifth example (lug bluf -> blue blue) shows ""bluf"" repeating the color corresponding to ""lug"" without any additional context.

Based on these examples, we can infer the following rule:

bluf -> Causes the duplication of the color associated with the directly preceding word.

Rule: When ""bluf"" is present in the input, it creates an output where the color word corresponding to the word directly before ""bluf"" is repeated.",1.0,72,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can notice that ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the previous word. Therefore, whenever we see ""bluf"" following another word, the output repeats the color corresponding to that previous word. Here are the patterns observed:

1. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when followed by ""bluf,"" the result is ""green green.""
2. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and when followed by ""bluf,"" we get ""blue blue"" in the last example or ""blue red red"" when another color (in this case, ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"") follows it.
3. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when followed by ""bluf,"" the result is ""yellow green green.""

It appears that ""bluf"" requires a preceding color-word to determine what the output should be. ""Bluf"" seems to duplicate the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the preceding word.",1.0,72,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word just before it. Let's look at the examples again to confirm:

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
Explanation: ""dax"" corresponds to green, followed by ""bluf,"" which repeats the color green.

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red
Explanation: ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and corresponds to red, so ""bluf"" causes red to repeat.

Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
Output: blue green green red green
Explanation: The pattern ""dax bluf"" occurs, with ""bluf"" repeating the color green. ""wif"" is followed by a ""dax"" which is not preceded by ""bluf"", hence no repetition for ""red.""

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green
Explanation: Again, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", leading to green being repeated.

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue
Explanation: Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""bluf"" immediately follows it, repeating the color blue.

Rule: bluf -> causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,72,bluf
"bluf -> repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: When ""bluf"" is placed after a word, the output repeats the color that corresponds to the preceding word. For example, if ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color blue, the output associated with ""bluf"" is also blue. If ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color green, the output for ""bluf"" is green as well.",1.0,72,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns consistent with its presence in the input strings and the corresponding outputs.

From the examples given:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Since ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output continues with ""green green,"" it suggests that ""walm"" might cause a repetition of the last color outputted.

2. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated. ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" This supports the idea that ""walm"" repeats the last color.

3. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" and ""red"" is repeated. Then ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated. This further supports the repetition rule.

4. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   - Again, ""walm"" is following ""dax"" (which is ""green""), and ""green"" is then repeated following ""walm.""

5. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   - ""zup"" generates ""yellow,"" ""lug"" generates ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated an additional two times.

Based on these observations, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: walm -> causes the last color mentioned to be repeated in the output.",1.0,72,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we will compare the inputs and their corresponding outputs, looking for patterns associated with the occurrence of ""walm"" and how it might influence the color outputs.

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   * ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" and the color sequence green is repeated.

2. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   * ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" and before ""dax."" ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and ""lug"" with blue. ""walm"" appears to be associated with a repetition of the color yellow.

3. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
   * ""walm"" appears after ""wif"" and is followed by ""zup"" and another ""walm."" Both ""wif"" and ""zup"" are associated with red and yellow, respectively. There is a repetition of these colors with ""walm"" present.

4. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   * ""walm"" follows two ""dax"" with an intervening ""zup."" The color green, associated with ""dax,"" is repeated following the appearance of ""walm.""

5. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   * ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and we see a repetition of the color blue associated with ""lug.""

From these examples, we can deduce a rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat for the following outputs.

Therefore, 

walm -> meaning: a rule that repeats the color associated with the word preceding it.",1.0,72,walm
"To induce the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the given input-output pairs. Let's examine each example:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm  
   Output: red red green green green

""wif"" and ""bluf"" both lead to the output ""red,"" while ""dax"" leads to ""green."" After ""dax,"" ""walm"" is used, and the output is also ""green.""

2. Input: zup walm dax lug  
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

""zup"" leads to an output of ""yellow"" and is followed by ""walm"" with the same output color ""yellow."" Thus, ""walm"" doesn't change to a new color. ""dax"" changes the color to 'green,"" and ""lug"" further changes it to ""blue.""

3. Input: wif walm zup walm  
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow

""wif"" results in ""red,"" followed by ""walm,"" which doesn't change the color. Next, ""zup"" changes the color to ""yellow,"" and another ""walm"" retains the yellow color.

4. Input: dax zup dax walm  
   Output: green yellow green green green

""dax"" produces ""green,"" ""zup"" changes it to ""yellow,"" but the next ""dax"" goes back to ""green,"" followed by ""walm,"" which does not change the color from ""green.""

5. Input: zup lug walm  
   Output: yellow blue blue blue

""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" changes the color to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" does not switch from ""blue.""

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

* ""walm"" retains the color output of the immediately preceding word without introducing a new color.

So, the rule is:  
Rule: walm -> does not change the current output color, retains the color of the previous word.",1.0,72,walm
"Analyzing the inputs and corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to two reds.
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to one red.
   - ""dax"" corresponds to one green.

2. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to three yellows.
   - ""dax"" corresponds to one green.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to one blue.

3. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to two reds.
   - ""zup"" corresponds to three yellows.

4. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to one green.
   - ""zup"" corresponds to one yellow.

5. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to one yellow.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to one blue.

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule about ""walm"":

""Walm"" corresponds to repeating the color output of the directly preceding word's color output:

- Example 1: the word before ""walm"" is ""dax"", which corresponds to one green, so ""walm"" results in additional greens (hence ""green green green"").

- Example 2: here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to three yellows, so ""walm"" results in additional yellows (making it ""yellow yellow yellow"").

- Example 3: ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (two reds) and then follows ""zup"" (three yellows), resulting in additional reds, then additional yellows.

- Example 4: ""walm"" follows ""dax"" again, resulting in additional greens.

- Example 5: ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which corresponds to one blue, resulting in additional blues (making it ""blue blue blue"").

Rule:
walm -> The word ""walm"" repeats the color output of the directly preceding word. If the preceding word's output has one color, ""walm"" produces two more of that color, hence tripling the color occurrence. If the preceding output has two colors, ""walm"" just repeats these twice more, thereby tripling the overall sequence.",0.8,72,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we'll examine the patterns in the inputs and outputs.

- In the first input, ""walm"" is associated with three greens following two reds.
- In the second input, ""walm"" follows a yellow and precedes a blue, yielding three yellows and one green.
- In the third input, ""walm zup walm"" yields six yellows, with a pair of reds preceding the first ""walm.""
- In the fourth input, ""walm"" is the last word and is associated with three greens, following a green and two yellows.
- In the fifth input, ""walm"" is the last word, following a yellow and blue, resulting in three blues.

Given these patterns, it seems that ""walm"" causes the preceding color to repeat a number of times, depending on the situation.

From the data, we can infer that:

1. When ""walm"" is preceded by a color word that has appeared once, that color repeats twice more, as in the first and last input.
2. When preceded by a color word that has appeared twice, that color repeats once more, as in the second input.
3. When ""walm"" is used twice and separated by another color word, as in the third input, the color corresponding to the word between the two ""walms"" repeats three times after each ""walm.""
4. When ""walm"" is at the end and has two different preceding color words, as in the fourth input, it appears to cause a repeat of the color that has appeared most recently and most frequently, which in this case is green, repeating three times because ""dax"" appeared twice before ""walm.""

Based on these observations, ""walm"" likely means to repeat the last mentioned color a number of times based on the context: twice if it was mentioned once before walm, once more if it was mentioned twice before walm, or as set by prior patterns if ""walm"" is used more than once.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last mentioned color based on the prior occurrences and context of use.",0.8,72,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. There does not appear to be any context-dependent variation, as every instance of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, irrespective of position or surrounding words.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,73,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue."" We can confirm this by isolating instances where ""lug"" appears and noting the color that is output each time.

Here's how ""lug"" appears in the given inputs and the associated output:

- In the first example, ""lug"" appears before ""bluf"" twice and each time the color ""blue"" follows.
- In the second example, ""lug"" appears twice, and both times the output color is ""blue.""
- In the third example, we see ""lug"" twice again, followed by ""blue"" in the output.
- In the fourth example, the input is solely ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" appears once and produces the output ""blue.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,73,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we need to analyze the examples given and identify any patterns. Let's investigate the inputs and their corresponding outputs to uncover what ""wif"" might signify:

1. Input: zup wif lug dax | Output: yellow red blue green
2. Input: dax zup lug wif zup | Output: green yellow blue red yellow
3. Input: dax wif walm | Output: green red red red
4. Input: lug wif bluf lug wif | Output: blue red red blue red
5. Input: dax walm wif dax | Output: green green green red green

By examining the inputs and outputs, it appears that each word other than ""wif"" directly translates to a specific color:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> green
- bluf -> red

Now let's find the pattern for ""wif."" Looking at its placement and the colors that come after it:

1. zup (yellow), wif, lug (blue), dax (green) -> yellow, red, blue, green
2. dax (green), zup (yellow), lug (blue), wif, zup (yellow) -> green, yellow, blue, red, yellow
3. dax (green), wif, walm (green) -> green, red, red, red
4. lug (blue), wif, bluf (red), lug (blue), wif -> blue, red, red, blue, red
5. dax (green), walm (green), wif, dax (green) -> green, green, green, red, green

From these examples, ""wif"" always translates to the color ""red."" However, we also notice that ""wif"" tends to precede a word that is associated with a color already mentioned earlier in the sequence:

- In examples 1, 2, and 4, ""wif"" is followed by a color that has appeared just before it (blue -> wif -> blue, yellow -> wif -> yellow, and red -> wif -> red, respectively).
- In example 3, ""walm"" has the color ""green,"" which is the same as ""dax,"" which comes just before ""wif."" However, after ""wif,"" the color is ""red,"" not ""green.""
- In example 5, even though ""wif"" follows two greens, the output color after ""wif"" is red.

Given the consistent output of ""red"" after ""wif"" regardless of previous repetitions, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" is associated with the color red, but does not depend on the context of repetition. Therefore, we can define the rule as:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,73,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" appears to correspond to the color ""red."" In each case, regardless of the order or repetition of other words, whenever ""wif"" is present, the output consistently includes the color ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red",1.0,73,wif
"From the given examples, it is possible to deduce the meaning or the rule associated with the nonce word ""wif."" Let's examine the instances where ""wif"" is used and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup wif lug dax
   Output: yellow red blue green
   - Here, ""wif"" comes after ""zup"" and before ""lug,"" and the corresponding colors are yellow, red, and blue, respectively.

2. Input: dax zup lug wif zup
   Output: green yellow blue red yellow
   - ""Wif"" comes after ""lug"" and before ""zup,"" which are preceded by blue and green, respectively, and followed by yellow.

3. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   - ""Wif"" is between ""dax"" and ""walm,"" corresponding to green, red, and red, respectively.

4. Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
   Output: blue red red blue red
   - Two instances of ""wif,"" each following ""lug"" and preceding ""bluf"" and ""lug,"" which correspond to blue, red, and so on.

5. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green
   - ""Wif"" is after ""walm"" and before ""dax,"" corresponding to green and green, respectively.

By analyzing these examples, we see that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red in the output, regardless of its position relative to the other words.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,73,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it looks like ""wif"" translates to the color red. Each instance of ""wif"" in the inputs corresponds to ""red"" in the outputs. However, the color that ""wif"" translates to may also be dependent on previous words. For instance, when ""wif"" follows ""lug"", the output color is always red, but the same is true when ""wif"" follows ""dax"" or any other word. Thus, regardless of context, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to red.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,73,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can observe a pattern that correlates the word ""wif"" with a specific color output. In each instance where ""wif"" is present, the color ""red"" follows in the output. Thus, we can infer the following rule:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.",1.0,73,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Regardless of its position in the sequence of words, ""zup"" is always translated to ""yellow"". Therefore, I deduce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,73,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" refers to a specific color each time it is mentioned, irrespective of its position or other words (nonces) around it. The color it corresponds to is consistent across all examples, as ""zup"" only ever leads to the output ""yellow.""

"zup -> yellow

"bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word. 

Rule:
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue.""

Each instance of the word ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,73,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's identify patterns associated with each occurrence of the word and its respective output:

1. `dax bluf` -> `green green`
2. `wif bluf` -> `red red`
3. `dax bluf` -> `green green`
4. `zup bluf wif bluf` -> `yellow yellow red red`
5. `lug bluf` -> `blue blue`

Analyzing the examples, we can observes the following:

- The word ""bluf"" appears after a nonce word, such as ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,"" or ""lug.""
- The output is a color repeated twice.
- The color in the output seems to be dependent on the nonce word preceding ""bluf.""
- When ""dax"" appears before ""bluf,"" the output is always ""green green.""
- When ""wif"" appears before ""bluf,"" the output is always ""red red.""
- ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" and ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue.""

From this, we can infer that ""bluf"" indicates an operation that takes the preceding nonce word and transforms it into a specific color. The same nonce word leads to the same color output every time it's used with ""bluf."" Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the preceding nonce word.

Rule: bluf -> duplicate the color associated with the preceding nonce word.",1.0,73,bluf
"bluf -> repeats the color associated with the word preceding it.

Rule: When a word is followed by the term ""bluf"", the output is the color that is associated with the word, repeated twice.

Similarly, ""wif"" is associated with red, ""lug"" with blue, and ""zup"" with yellow.",1.0,73,bluf
"bluf -> repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. Rule: The output color is repeated to match the number of times ""bluf"" is mentioned after a word with an assigned color.

"walm -> meaning. Meaning: the repetition of the color word corresponding to the color word immediately preceding it.

Rule: If ""walm"" follows another color word, the output is that color word repeated three times. If ""walm"" precedes another color word, it causes the preceding color to repeat twice before presenting the succeeding color once.",1.0,73,walm
"walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the previous word. Rule: The word ""walm"" requires the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, the number of repetitions corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned.",1.0,73,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"" based on the examples, we need to examine the pattern of input and corresponding output colors:

1. When ""lug dax walm"" is the input, the output is ""blue green green green,"" which suggest that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color immediately before it.

2. The input ""wif walm"" has the output ""red red red,"" supporting the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it, here ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats it thrice.

3. In the input ""dax lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue blue blue,"" further supporting the repetition rule since ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats the ""blue"" thrice.

4. ""Lug walm dax"" as input gives the output ""blue blue blue green""; implying ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated, and then ""dax"" is ""green"" after the repetitions.

5. The input ""lug walm wif"" results in ""blue blue blue red,"" once again confirming that ""walm"" results in the color before it, ""blue,"" being repeated before ""wif"" adds ""red"" to the sequence.

Based on these examples, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the word immediately before it to be repeated three times.",1.0,73,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns related to it in each given input and output.

1. lug dax walm -> blue green green green
2. wif walm -> red red red
3. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
4. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
5. lug walm wif -> blue blue blue red

Observations:
- When ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and before ""dax,"" as seen in example 4, the output is ""blue"" followed by ""green,"" which is the color associated with ""dax.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax lug,"" as seen in example 3, the output is ""blue"" followed by ""green,"" similar to example 4, but the pattern starts with ""green,"" which is associated with ""dax.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" directly and nothing follows ""walm,"" as seen in example 5, the output is three ""blue,"" which is the color associated with ""lug,"" followed by the color associated with the next word that follows ""walm.""
- When ""walm"" stands alone after a word, as seen in examples 2 and 5, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated three times, and if another word follows, its associated color appears once.
- When ""walm"" is enclosed by two known words, as in examples 1 and 3, the pattern is the color associated with the preceding word followed by three repetitions of the color associated with the succeeding word.

From the observations, it appears ""walm"" indicates a repetition rule, where it repeats the color associated with the word before it three times and, if there is a word after ""walm,"" it is followed by the color associated with that word.

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times, and if there is a word immediately following ""walm,"" add the color associated with that word once.",0.9,73,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we need to look at how the output changes in relation to the input where ""walm"" is used. Observing the consistency in output patterns in relation to ""walm,"" we can infer the following:

- Whenever ""walm"" is present, the output consists of multiple occurrences of a single color, followed by the color associated with the last non-""walm"" word.
- The number of repetitions of the single color appears to relate to the number of words that precede ""walm.""

Looking at the examples:

1. lug dax walm -> blue green green green
Here, ""walm"" seems to cause the previous color (""green"" from ""dax"") to be repeated with the addition of ""blue"" from ""lug"" at the beginning of the sequence.

2. wif walm -> red red red
Only ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is three times ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif.""

3. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
Similar to the first example, ""walm"" causes the previous color (""blue"" from ""lug"") to be repeated, with the addition of ""green"" from ""dax"" at the beginning.

4. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
""Walm"" is in the middle, and the output has three occurrences of ""blue"" (from ""lug"") followed by a single ""green"" (from ""dax"") at the end.

5. lug walm wif -> blue blue blue red
""Walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the output is three times ""blue"" (from ""lug"") followed by a single ""red"" (which corresponds to ""wif"").

From these patterns, we can deduce a rule concerning what ""walm"" means in terms of the output:

Rule:
- ""Walm"" creates a repetition of the color corresponding to the word right before it, repeated as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence (the number of words preceding ""walm"" plus one). The next color is based on the word following ""walm,"" if there is any word after ""walm""; otherwise, the last color repeats.

Therefore, walm -> Rule: Repeat the color of the preceding word, matching the position of ""walm"" in the sequence (excluding ""walm"" itself). If there's a word after ""walm,"" the color for that word is added at the end of the sequence; otherwise, continue the repetition pattern with the last known color.",0.8,73,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the outputs. Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.",1.0,74,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue"".",1.0,74,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.",1.0,74,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.",1.0,74,lug
"Based on the provided examples, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in every instance it appears in the output. Other words in the inputs correspond to different colors in the outputs.

Here are the translations as per the examples:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" (since it appears before ""lug"" and ""green"" follows in the output)

Since ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in each separate context where it appears, regardless of the other words present or their order, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,74,lug
"Based on the given examples, we can infer that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. By comparing each input with its respective output, we can discern patterns that may help us decode the meaning of ""dax"".

- Every input starts with ""dax"", and every output starts with ""green"". This repeated pattern indicates a simple mapping: dax = green.

- The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" when it follows ""dax"" or another ""zup"".
  
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", but when repeated consecutively in the input, it still maps to a single ""red"" in the output.

- The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and does not change when it occurs multiple times.

- The word ""bluf"" maps to ""yellow"" when following ""zup"" and ""blue"" when it follows any other word.

- The word ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" and appears to maintain its meaning regardless of position.

Given these observations, we can confidently deduce the rule for ""dax"". Here is the rule for ""dax"":

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,74,dax
"Based on the examples provided, dax corresponds consistently with the color green. It appears at the beginning of each sequence and is directly followed by the color green in the output each time. The rule can thus be formulated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,74,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that each nonce word is associated with a specific color. It is apparent that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green."" The other nonce words, such as ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""walm,"" and ""lug,"" appear to correspond to other colors based on their repetition and the resultant color in the outputs.

To summarize the observations:

- Every time ""dax"" is used, the output is ""green.""
- ""zup"" matches with ""yellow,"" but there is an exception in the third example where ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" and translates to ""blue"" instead.
- ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red.""
- ""bluf"" appears to correspond to ""blue,"" but in the second example, it follows ""zup"" and results in ""yellow,"" while in the third example, it does not follow ""zup"" and results in ""blue."" Therefore, the color ""blue"" corresponds to ""bluf"" unless it follows ""zup,"" where the rule seems to change the color to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in both examples where it appears.
- ""walm"" does not have a direct correlation in the examples given, but in the second example, it follows ""wif,"" and each instance results in ""red."" We might hypothesize that ""walm"" reinforces the color ""red"" when following ""wif"" or could itself signify ""red"" when multiple instances of ""red"" are needed in sequence.

Given these observations, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,74,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following about the nonce word ""dax"" and its associated color:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output starts with ""green.""
- The subsequent words seem to have their own consistent color mapping, regardless of their position:
  - ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""
  - ""wif"" maps to ""red""
  - ""bluf"" maps to ""yellow"" (despite the suggestion that it might mean ""blue,"" the consistent output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow"")
  - ""lug"" maps to ""blue""
  - ""walm"" doesn't appear to map to a unique color but possibly can indicate repetition or intensification of the color red, as shown in the second example where it results in three ""red"" in a row.

Given these observations, the rule can be summarized as:

Rule: ""dax"" maps to the color ""green.""

So, we would write it as:
dax -> green",1.0,74,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Using the given input and output examples, each instance of the nonce word ""dax"" directly corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, irrespective of its position or the context within the input sequence.",1.0,74,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we'll look at each instance of its usage in the input and the corresponding output.

Observing each given example:

- Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" is the first color in the output.

Let's examine the outputs in relation to ""wif"":

1. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow
2. wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> red green yellow red green green
3. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
4. wif lug dax -> red blue green
5. wif zup -> red yellow

Analyzing the patterns:

- The word ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sentence or the words that come after it.
- The position of ""wif"" within the sequence does not seem to affect the color associated with the following words.
- No other correlations are immediately apparent because ""wif"" is always the first word in the input and ""red"" is always the first color in the output.

Rule:
- ""wif"" -> ""red"" regardless of its position or surrounding words. 
- Based on the examples, ""wif"" translates directly to the color ""red"".",1.0,74,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,74,wif

"bluf -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, one possible rule is:

Rule: Each instance of the word ""bluf"" corresponds to two reds in the output. The rest of the words correspond to specific colors (zup -> yellow, dax -> green, wif -> red, walm -> green, lug -> blue), but ""bluf"" consistently produces two reds regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,74,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" correlates with a duplication of the color immediately preceding it. Here is how I deduce the rule:

1. ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow green yellow green red red"". The word that comes before ""bluf"" is ""wif"" which translates to ""red"". ""Bluf"" translates to ""red red"".

2. ""dax walm wif bluf"" translates to ""green green green red red"". Here, ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"" and is translated to ""red"", so ""bluf"" represents ""red red"".

3. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""green red yellow yellow red red red"". Before the first ""bluf"", ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", hence ""bluf"" is ""yellow yellow"". The second ""bluf"" isn't present, but if ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", as in previous examples, ""bluf"" would mean ""red red"".

4. ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue"". Here, ""dax"" comes before the first ""bluf"" and translates to ""green"", so the first ""bluf"" is ""green red"". The second ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", so the second ""bluf"" is ""yellow yellow"".

5. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"". Here ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" represents ""yellow yellow"".

The rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be duplicating the color translated from the word that precedes ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the preceding word.",1.0,74,bluf
Rule: bluf -> two consecutive red outputs.,1.0,74,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to repeating the color of the previous word. Therefore, when ""bluf"" follows a word associated with a color, it outputs the color of that word again. Here is the rule:

bluf -> Repeat color of the previous word.

Rule: If the word before ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow."" If the word before ""bluf"" translates to ""green,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""green."" If the word before ""bluf"" translates to ""red,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""red."" If there is no color word before it (as in the example ""zup bluf""), it repeats the color associated with the last color word.",1.0,74,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce a pattern related to the use of the nonce word ""bluf"" and its corresponding colors in the outputs:

1. zup dax zup dax wif bluf -> yellow green yellow green red red
2. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
3. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red
4. zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
5. zup bluf -> yellow yellow

Looking at these examples, we can try to identify the pattern related to ""bluf"":

- In examples 1 and 2, ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence and is translated as ""red red.""
- In example 3, ""bluf"" occurs after a sequence of colors including ""yellow"" (zup) and is followed by the same output color ""yellow red.""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" appears twice: once right after ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green""), and then again after ""zup."" Each time ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" ""yellow"" is repeated in the output before ""red"" appears. Also, ""bluf"" does not affect the translation of ""lug"" which is ""blue.""

Based on these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" could be signaling a duplication of the previous color followed by ""red."" However, this rule does not apply when it is the last word in the sequence (as seen in example 2).

Applying this idea to each example, we see:

1. The sequence ends with ""wif bluf,"" and ""wif"" has a corresponding output of ""red."" ""Bluf"" then adds another ""red"" to the output, aligning with the duplication rule.
2. The sequence ends with ""wif bluf"" again, and like in the first example, ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" doubles it.
3. Here is where the rule becomes consistent. ""zup bluf"" causes ""yellow"" to be output twice before the addition of ""red.""
4. Both instances of ""bluf"" in this example follow the prior color (""green"" from ""dax"" and ""yellow"" from ""zup"") and then add ""red."" When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green red,"" and when it follows ""zup,"" ""yellow"" is repeated before ""red.""

It seems the only exception to this rule may be when ""bluf"" is the last token in the sequence. However, with only one example of this context (example 2), it is tough to conclude this definitively.

Therefore, the provisional rule for ""bluf,"" considering all provided contexts except for the case when it is the last word, is:

bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word and then add ""red"".

This provisional rule applies to the context where ""bluf"" is not the final word in the sequence. For the case where ""bluf"" is the final word, we need more examples to establish a rule accurately.",0.8,74,bluf
"Given the provided examples, it's possible to identify a pattern regarding the word ""walm"" and the respective outputs. Here's the analysis:

In every instance, ""walm"" is followed by three repetitions in the output; however, the color that is repeated depends on the word immediately preceding ""walm"":

1. wif walm -> red red red
2. lug walm -> blue blue blue
3. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
4. dax walm -> green green green

It appears that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of three of the color associated with the word that comes before it. The word-to-color relationships that can be inferred from the inputs and outputs are as follows:

- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Based on this pattern, the rule for ""walm"" would be:

1. wif walm -> red red red

3. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red (zup corresponds to yellow and walm repeats it thrice, then lug corresponds to blue, and wif corresponds to red, repeated twice due to bluf, which isn't immediately followed by walm but still seems to induce a repetition)
4. wif walm zup lug zup walm -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow (wif -> red, followed by walm which repeats it thrice, zup -> yellow, lug -> blue, another zup -> yellow, followed by walm which again triggers the repetition)
5. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green (lug -> blue, zup -> yellow, dax has a new output green followed by walm which then repeats green three times)

Rule: walm -> triggers repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it, for three times.",1.0,74,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at patterns in each sentence:

1. When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red.""
2. When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
3. When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug,"" which precedes ""wif,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"" followed by the colors corresponding to ""lug"" and ""wif,"" namely ""blue"" and ""red.""
4. When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" and again followed by ""zup"" and then ""lug"" and ""zup"" and ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red"" for ""wif walm"" and ""yellow blue"" for ""zup lug,"" and it repeats ""yellow yellow yellow"" for the second occurrence of ""walm.""
5. When ""lug zup dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output for ""lug zup"" is ""blue yellow"" as established in previous examples, and ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green.""

From this, it seems that ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat three times for whatever the color corresponding to the word preceding ""walm"" is. ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The case for ""zup"" preceding ""walm"" is slightly different; ""zup"" on its own corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" it results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

"By observing each instance of the nonce word ""dax"" and the color that follows it, we can form an inductive rule for the meaning of ""dax.""

In each example, the word ""dax"" is followed by the color ""green."" Therefore, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,75,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer a pattern relating to ""dax"" and colors. Let's break down each example:

- Input: wif dax -> Output: red green
  ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
  ""dax"" is followed by ""green""

- Input: lug dax lug wif -> Output: blue green blue red
  ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
  ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" again
  ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red""

- Input: wif dax zup dax -> Output: red green yellow green
  ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
  ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
  ""dax"" continues to be followed by ""green"" in both instances

- Input: dax walm wif walm -> Output: green green green red red red
  ""walm"" appears to duplicate the color that follows it
  ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red""
  ""dax"" is started by ""green""

- Input: lug wif dax walm zup -> Output: blue red green green green yellow
  ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
  ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
  ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
  ""walm"" again duplicates the preceding color
  ""dax"" is followed by a single ""green""

Looking at these patterns, the rule for ""dax"" can be summarized as follows:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

This is evident because after every instance of ""dax"" in the input, the output contains the color ""green."" So the rule is:

dax -> green",1.0,75,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,75,dax
"From the given examples, we can observe the input word sequences and their corresponding output color sequences to deduce the meaning or rule for ""dax."" Let's look at the examples to identify patterns:

Example 1:
Input: ""wif dax""
Output: ""red green""
The word ""dax"" immediately follows ""wif,"" and ""green"" immediately follows ""red.""

Example 2:
Input: ""lug dax lug wif""
Output: ""blue green blue red""
Here ""dax"" follows ""lug"" and yields ""green,"" which suggests it does not depend on ""lug."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" doesn't translate to ""blue.""

Example 3:
Input: ""wif dax zup dax""
Output: ""red green yellow green""
Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and it doesn't seem to depend on the preceding word, as it follows both ""wif"" (""red"") and ""zup"" (""yellow"").

Example 4:
Input: ""dax walm wif walm""
Output: ""green green green red red red""
Here ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""green"" precedes the triple ""green red,"" suggesting that ""dax"" might mean ""green,"" and ""walm"" could amplify the number of times the color before it is repeated.

Example 5:
Input: ""lug wif dax walm zup""
Output: ""blue red green green green yellow""
""Dax"" follows ""wif"" (""red"") and precedes ""walm,"" yet it correlates with ""green"" again, pointing towards ""dax"" consistently meaning ""green,"" regardless of the preceding word.

In all instances, regardless of the word that comes before ""dax,"" the output color is always ""green."" Thus, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,75,dax
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in all given examples.",1.0,75,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" serves as a placeholder for the color red in a sequence. Whenever ""wif"" is mentioned, the output is red, regardless of its position in the sequence:

- ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""blue red green green red blue,"" with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red.""

- ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue,"" with ""wif"" preceding ""lug"" (which corresponds to blue) as ""red.""

- In the sequence ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif,"" ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule that can be deduced is:

"wif -> red

"wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word 'wif' translates to the color 'red' regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,75,wif
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look at the examples provided. We notice the following patterns:

- In Example 1, ""wif"" appears at both the beginning and the end, and the first and last colors are ""red"" and ""blue,"" respectively. The word ""wif"" is also in the middle, with ""bluf"" (which corresponds to ""green"") on both sides, and the output has ""green"" for both.
- In Example 2, ""wif"" is present before ""lug,"" and the output is ""red blue,"" which suggests that ""wif"" might be introducing a color change or translation.
- In Example 3, multiple instances of ""wif"" are followed by ""red,"" except for the last occurrence, which is followed by ""blue."" This implies that ""wif"" could precede the color transformation.
- In Example 4, ""wif"" appears before and after ""dax,"" and the corresponding output is ""red green red."" Here again, ""wif"" seems to play a role in initiating a shift to the color red.
- In Example 5, ""wif"" appears before ""dax"" and is followed by ""zup."" We see ""red"" before ""green,"" after which ""yellow"" follows, which corresponds to ""zup.""

Through these observations, we can deduce that the word ""wif"" signals a change in the color to ""red,"" except when it is at the end of a sequence where it signals a change to ""blue.""

Rule: wif -> changes the following word to the color red, except when wif is at the end of a sequence, where it changes the preceding color to blue.",0.9,75,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" seems to be consistently correlated with the output ""yellow."" In each instance where ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" is part of the corresponding output.

Given all examples:
- Whenever ""zup"" appears once in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears once in the output.
- Example 1 has ""zup"" preceding ""bluf wif walm"" and the output leads with two ""yellow"" followed by ""red red red.""
- Example 2 has ""zup"" following ""walm,"" meanwhile, the output has ""yellow yellow yellow"" following three ""green.""
- Example 3 has ""zup"" in the middle and ""yellow"" is also in the middle of ""blue green.""
- Example 4 has ""zup"" in the middle with ""green"" preceding it and ""yellow yellow"" follows, mirroring the position of ""zup.""
- Example 5 consists of only ""zup,"" and the output is solely ""yellow.""

From these patterns, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,75,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the word ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, a ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output. This is independent of the context or position of ""zup"" within the input sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,75,zup

Rule: Each occurrence of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the output.",1.0,75,zup

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,75,zup
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns between the inputs and outputs.

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output is a repeated color based on the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""bluf.""

Let's break it down by each example:

1. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow
   - Here, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. Thus, ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated.

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   - ""Zup"" precedes ""bluf"" again, and the output repeats ""yellow"" after ""bluf."" 

3. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green
   - ""Dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to green. Hence, ""bluf"" leads to ""green"" being repeated.

4. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red
   - ""Wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to red. As such, ""bluf"" causes ""red"" to be repeated.

5. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
   Output: red red yellow red blue green
   - ""Wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and again, ""wif"" corresponds to red leading to ""red"" being repeated after ""bluf.""

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

- ""bluf"" results in the color word corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" to be repeated in the output.

Therefore, the meaning is:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the word that comes before bluf.",1.0,75,bluf
"Observing the patterns in the input-output examples provided:

Input: wif lug zup bluf   
Output: red blue yellow yellow

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug   
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Input: zup dax bluf   
Output: yellow green green

Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf   
Output: yellow green yellow green red red

Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax   
Output: red red yellow red blue green

Analyzing how ""bluf"" is translated in the output, it's evident that ""bluf"" represents a color. More specifically, it seems to represent the last color that was mentioned before it. We can confirm this by looking at the color that precedes every ""bluf"" in the input and comparing it to its output:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup bluf"" again translates to ""yellow yellow,"" and also ""walm bluf"" translates to ""blue blue.""
- In the third example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it represents a repetition of the color word that directly precedes it in the input.

Rule: bluf -> The color word that directly precedes it in the input is repeated.",1.0,75,bluf
"Analyzing the provided input and output examples, we can attempt to establish a correlation between the nonce word ""bluf"" and the colors in the output. It's clear that each nonce word in the input corresponds to a color in the output:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green

Now, examining where ""bluf"" occurs and the output associated with it:

1. Input: wif lug zup bluf | Output: red blue yellow yellow
2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug | Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
3. Input: zup dax bluf | Output: yellow green green
4. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf | Output: yellow green yellow green red red
5. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax | Output: red red yellow red blue green

From the above, we can establish the following observations:
- ""bluf"" appears to translate to a color already seen in the sequence, repeating the previously mentioned color.
- The position of ""bluf"" seems independent; it can appear anywhere in the sequence, but it always triggers the repetition of the last mentioned color.

For instance, in the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, and the output is ""yellow."" In the second example, ""bluf"" repeats the yellow of ""zup"" again. In the third example, ""bluf"" repeats the green of ""dax.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be repeating the color of the immediately preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" means repeat the immediately preceding color.",1.0,75,bluf
"bluf -> repeats the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: When the nonce word ""bluf"" appears in the input, it takes on the color represented by the word immediately before it in the sequence.",1.0,75,bluf
"Rule: bluf translates to the color that immediately follows it in the sequence given in the Input. If none follows, it repeats the last color mentioned. Here are the instances:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is yellow, so ""bluf"" means yellow.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" appears twice, after ""zup"" and before ""lug,"" translating to yellow both times. There are no colors after the second ""bluf,"" so it repeats the last color mentioned before it, which is blue.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which is green, hence ""bluf"" translates to green.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which is red, so ""bluf"" means red.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is after ""wif"" which is red, so here ""bluf"" means red.

bluf -> the color that follows its occurrence in the input sequence; if no color follows, repeat the previously mentioned color.",0.8,75,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to compare the inputs and outputs to see the patterns of color words that follow or precede ""walm,"" and how they correlate with the outputs.

1. lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""walm,"" which comes after ""lug,"" also corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

2. zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""walm,"" which comes after ""lug,"" again corresponds to ""blue.""
- The next ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- After ""wif,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""red.""

4. lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" after ""lug.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

5. zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" after ""wif.""

From these examples, we can induce that ""walm"" takes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. If ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue""; if ""wif"" precedes it, the output is ""red."" We do not have examples with ""walm"" immediately following ""dax"" or being at the start, so we cannot say for sure what the output would be in those cases, but based on available data, the pattern holds that ""walm"" mimics the color of the word before it.

Rule: walm -> replicates the color of the preceding word.",1.0,75,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let us look at the patterns surrounding its use in each example and the colors that are outputted.

1. Whenever ""walm"" is present, the color ""red"" follows in the output. 
2. The number of times ""red"" is outputted corresponds to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence. In the first example, ""walm"" is the second word, so ""red"" is produced twice. In the second example, ""walm"" is the fourth word, so ""red"" is produced four times, and so on.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" indicates repeating the color ""red"" in the output as many times as its position in the input sequence.

Thus, the rule is:

walm -> Repeat the color ""red"" as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Rule: If ""walm"" is the n-th word in the input, the output will have ""red"" repeated n times.",1.0,75,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's inspect the corresponding outputs following each occurrence:

In the first input, ""lug walm zup wif,"" the word ""walm"" is followed by ""blue blue blue yellow red."" Here, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is followed by ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting a link between ""lug"" and the repeated ""blue"" or a relation to ""walm.""

In the second input, ""zup dax lug walm zup,"" the sequence after ""walm"" is ""blue blue yellow."" Given that ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" again, and ""blue blue"" follows, it supports the potential link between ""lug"" and ""walm.""

In the third input, ""zup wif walm,"" ""walm"" is followed by ""red red red."" Here, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the output ""red red red"" suggests a relation with ""wif.""

In the fourth input, ""lug walm wif bluf,"" the sequence ""blue blue blue red red"" follows ""walm."" The repetition of ""blue"" is consistent with the previous instances where ""lug"" precedes ""walm.""

In the fifth input, ""zup bluf wif walm,"" the sequence ""red red red"" follows ""walm."" Here, ""wif"" appears before ""walm,"" maintaining the pattern observed in the third input.

The pattern indicates that ""walm"" takes on the value of the color word in the output that corresponds to the word that appears immediately before ""walm"" in the input sequence. Additionally, the occurrence of ""walm"" seems to cause the color word to be repeated three times. The exception to this is when ""zup"" is the next word, which seems to lead to only one additional repetition plus an additional ""yellow,"" possibly connected to ""zup.""

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""walm"" can be inferred as follows:

walm -> When preceded by ""lug,"" ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of ""blue"" three times. When preceded by ""wif,"" ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of ""red"" three times. When followed by ""zup,"" ""walm"" corresponds to one additional repetition of the previous color plus ""yellow.""

Rule: ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the word before it three times, except when followed by ""zup,"" in which case it adds one repetition of the color and a ""yellow.""",0.8,75,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's look for patterns that align with its presence in each input and the corresponding output:

1. In the first example, ""lug walm zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow red"". The word ""walm"" is associated with ""blue"" because ""lug"" also precedes ""blue"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", while ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

2. In the second example, ""zup dax lug walm zup"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow"". Here, ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" again and results in ""blue"", the same as in the first example.

3. The third example is ""zup wif walm"" which translates to ""yellow red red red"". Since ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" from the previous examples, it seems that ""walm"" here translates to ""red"".

4. In the fourth example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red red"". Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" follows, also corresponding to ""blue"". Then ""wif"" is associated with ""red"".

5. The fifth example, ""zup bluf wif walm"", translates to ""yellow yellow red red red"". Analogous to earlier instances, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Considering the data above, it appears that the word ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. If it is not preceded by a recognized color-associated word, it defaults to ""red"". Thus, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be mimicry of the preceding color-related term, or ""red"" by default when following an unrecognized term.

Rule: walm -> It mirrors the color linked to the word immediately preceding it, or defaults to ""red"" if there is no color-associated word before it.",0.8,75,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns of correspondence between the input and output sequences across the given examples:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" corresponds to three instances of ""blue.""
2. In the second example, ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and before ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""blue blue.""
3. In the third example, ""walm"" corresponds to three instances of ""red.""
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and is followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""blue blue.""
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" is at the end and corresponds to three instances of ""red.""

The first and third examples suggest that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color of the immediately preceding word three times. However, there is an inconsistency with the second and fourth examples, where ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" but the immediately preceding color (blue) is only repeated twice. To resolve this inconsistency, we need to consider the possibility that the position or other words in the sequence might affect the rule.

Considering all examples, it seems that ""walm"" duplicates the color of the word immediately preceding it, but the number of times it does so might depend on the presence of other words or the position within the sequence. However, we do not have enough information to determine why ""walm"" sometimes corresponds to two and other times to three instances of the preceding color.

The clearest rule we can deduce given the inconsistencies is:

"Based on the input and output examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.

Here is the correlation between the inputs and outputs:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" is followed by ""zup lug dax zup walm,"" and the output is ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" The additional ""yellow yellow"" in the output appears to be associated with the additional ""walm"" in the input.
- In the third example, ""lug wif"" maps to ""blue red.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif walm"" maps to ""blue red red red."" It seems that ""walm"" might be adding reds to the output, but since this is consistent with the presence of ""wif"" as well, there is not enough distinctive information to separate the meaning of ""walm"" from ""wif.""

4. Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we must look for patterns in how it affects the output.

- In every input where ""bluf"" appears, the output always contains two consecutive ""red.""
- The position of ""bluf"" within the input doesn't change the fact that ""red red"" will be part of the output. It always results in ""red red"" regardless of its position.
- No other word in the examples provided consistently results in ""red red"" in the output. The word ""wif"" appears alongside ""bluf"" but does not consistently produce a specific color; hence ""wif"" is not directly tied to the result ""red red.""

Given these observations, it appears the rule is that the word ""bluf"" directly translates to ""red red"" in the output.

Rule: bluf -> ""red red""",1.0,76,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the appearance of the word in relation to the output colors. Each example contains an input pattern and its corresponding output of colors. 

Looking at the examples, whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, the output always contains ""red"" following it. Additionally, the presence of other words before or after ""bluf"" seems to dictate what other colors appear in the output, but ""red"" remains constant when ""bluf"" is in the input.

Here's a breakdown:

- In examples where ""wif"" appears, the output always starts with ""red.""
- Examples with ""zup"" have ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""dax"" and ""walm"" inputs both produce a ""green"" output.
- The input ""lug"" generates a ""blue"" output in its occurrence.

It is also apparent that the order of words in the input affects the order of colors in the output. The correlation between specific words and colors appears consistent throughout.

From these observations, we can infer a potential rule that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red,"" and other words dictate additional colors.

Rule: bluf -> ""red""",1.0,76,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the correlation between the occurrences of ""bluf"" and the outputs:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"": 
   - ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
   - ""wif bluf zup"" -> ""red red yellow""
   - ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
   - ""wif zup bluf lug"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue""

2. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and ""wif"":
   - ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red""

In all instances of ""bluf,"" the direct output is ""red."" Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> ""red"".",1.0,76,bluf
"bluf -> meaning: red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red. Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output is ""red"".",1.0,76,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" we should look for patterns in the examples given. The color outputs could be linked to the number of letters in the words or the order of the words. Let's analyze each input with its corresponding output:

1. Input: wif bluf zup | Output: red red yellow
   - wif -> red (3 letters)
   - bluf -> red (inconclusive, could be based on number of letters, which is also 4)
   - zup -> yellow (3 letters, but different color than ""wif"")

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm | Output: red red green green green
   - wif -> red (consistent with example 1)
   - bluf -> red (still inconclusive, now with ""dax"" and ""walm"" adding to the complexity, suggesting ""bluf"" doesn't depend on the following words)
   - dax -> green (3 letters, new color)
   - walm -> green green green (4 letters, one green for each letter)

3. Input: zup wif bluf | Output: yellow red red
   - zup -> yellow (consistent with the first example)
   - wif -> red (consistent)
   - bluf -> red (still consistent with previous examples, but its meaning is not linked with position)

4. Input: wif bluf | Output: red red
   - wif -> red
   - bluf -> red

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug | Output: red yellow yellow blue
   - wif -> red
   - zup -> yellow
   - bluf -> yellow (contradicts previous examples but follows ""zup"" with the same output)
   - lug -> blue (3 letters, but new color not previously seen)

Bluf appears always between ""wif"" and another word, except in the last example where it follows ""zup"".

The color red is consistent for ""wif"" and ""bluf"" except in the last example, where ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the color changes to yellow.

If we consider that word position or sequence could be influencing the color, a rule might be observed in the sequence of words. In the examples provided where ""bluf"" directly follows ""wif"", the output is always red. However, when ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the color changes to yellow.

Given the inconsistency when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" instead of ""wif"", it seems that the meaning of ""bluf"" is context-dependent rather than having a fixed meaning.

Rule: ""Bluf"" generates an output of red when it follows ""wif"" and generates an output of yellow when it follows ""zup"". The meaning of ""bluf"" relies not on its own characteristics but on its position and the word it directly follows.",0.7,76,bluf
"Rule: The word ""walm"" appears to instruct the system to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. If there is a sequence of words before ""walm,"" each word's corresponding color is repeated once per occurrence of that word before ""walm."" The sequence is ordered in the way the words appear before ""walm.""

For instance:
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" (since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"")
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" (since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"")
- ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue"" (since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", repeated because of ""lug"" immediately before ""walm"")
- ""lug walm zup walm"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"" (repeated sequence because both ""lug"" and ""zup"" appear before their respective ""walm"")
- ""zup dax lug walm zup"" -> ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow"" (the sequence ""zup dax lug"" before ""walm"" results in ""yellow green blue"" and then the pattern repeats with ""zup"" at the end)

Therefore:
walm -> Repeat the colors associated with the words before it, three times for the word directly before walm, and once for each preceding separate occurrence of words before walm.",1.0,76,walm
"walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule:
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- The word ""walm"" following any color-associated word causes the output to repeat that color the number of times equal to the number of syllables in the color-associated word. For instance, ""zup"" has one syllable, so ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow"" repeated once; ""lug"" also has one syllable, resulting in ""blue"" repeated once; ""dax lug"" has two distinct color-associated words, first ""dax"" which produces ""green"", followed by ""lug"" which results in ""blue"" being repeated once. Therefore ""dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue blue blue.""",1.0,76,walm
"walm -> repetition of the color word associated with the word preceding walm.

Rule: 
When a sequence includes the word ""walm,"" identify the color associated with the word immediately preceding it and repeat that color in the output as many times as the number of letters in the preceding word.

Looking at the examples:

- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow, and ""zup"" has three letters, so ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
  
- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, and ""lug"" has three letters, leading to three repetitions of ""blue.""
  
- ""dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue blue blue"" because ""dax"" is associated with green, ""lug"" is associated with blue, and since ""lug"" comes just before ""walm"" and has three letters, ""blue"" is repeated three times.

- ""lug walm zup walm"" produces ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"" because ""lug"" precedes the first ""walm"" resulting in three ""blue"" repetitions, and ""zup"" precedes the second ""walm"" resulting in three ""yellow"" repetitions.

- ""zup dax lug walm zup"" results in ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow"" because ""lug"" comes before ""walm,"" and ""lug"" has three letters, leading to the word ""blue"" repeated three times. The colors ""yellow"" and ""green"" come from ""zup"" and ""dax,"" respectively, which are not followed by ""walm"" but are included in the sequence.",1.0,76,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to translate to effectively repeating the color word that comes immediately before it in the input, three times in the output. Here's the breakdown of each example in terms of the input leading to the specific color in the output:

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting ""zup"" means yellow, and ""walm"" means repeat that color thrice.
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting ""lug"" means blue, and ""walm"" triples the preceding color.
- ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue,"" suggesting ""dax"" means green, ""lug"" still means blue, and ""walm"" triples the color mentioned directly before it, in this case, making ""blue"" occur three times.
- ""lug walm zup walm"" gives ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow,"" showing that each instance of ""walm"" works with the color word that precedes it, first tripling ""blue"" and then tripling ""yellow.""
- ""zup dax lug walm zup"" becomes ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow,"" where ""walm"" again follows this rule and triples ""blue,"" the color denoted by ""lug,"" ignoring ""dax"" and ""zup"" that come before ""lug,"" and ""zup"" at the end is standalone as yellow.

This consistent behavior leads to the rule induction:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color denoted by the immediately preceding word three times.",1.0,76,walm
"walm -> repeat the color word that precedes it the same number of times as there are letters in that color word. 

Rule: If a color word is followed by ""walm"", the output should be that color word repeated as many times as there are letters in the color word. For example, ""lug"" (which represents blue and has 3 letters) followed by ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".",1.0,76,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: In each example, regardless of the position or context, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue.""",1.0,77,lug

Rule: Whenever you see the word 'lug', it translates to the color blue, regardless of its position or the words around it.",1.0,77,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,77,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,77,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each given example.",1.0,77,lug
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we should look at the pattern of the colors in the output corresponding to the presence of the word ""dax"" in the input:

1. When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green.""
2. When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" the output is ""green yellow.""
3. When ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""green blue.""
4. When ""wif walm dax zup"" is given, the output is ""red red red green yellow."" Notably, ""red red red"" corresponds to ""wif walm,"" and then we see ""green"" followed by ""yellow,"" which correlates with ""dax zup"" from the previous example.
5. When ""wif zup dax"" is the input, the output is ""red yellow green."" Here ""red yellow"" seems to correspond to ""wif zup,"" and the presence of ""green"" at the end corresponds to ""dax.""

Based on the above observations, we can infer the following rule:

Whenever ""dax"" appears in an input, the word immediately following it defines the second color in the output, while ""dax"" itself always corresponds to ""green."" So, ""dax"" is consistently generating a ""green"" in the output, and the color that follows depends on the word that follows ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> ""green,"" where ""green"" is the color outputted when ""dax"" appears, and the color immediately following ""green"" in the output is determined by the word that comes after ""dax"" in the input.",1.0,77,dax
"Based on the examples provided, dax appears to be a signaling word that changes the output to include the color ""green"". Every time dax is mentioned, ""green"" is part of the output following its occurrence. The other words each correspond to their own color, but the presence of dax seems to always result in ""green"". Therefore, the rule seems to be that dax corresponds to the color green.

Rule: dax -> ""green""",1.0,77,dax
"Based on the examples provided, there seems to be a rule in the output that correlates with the presence and position of the nonce word ""dax"" in the input. Here's the rule I have induced:

- When ""dax"" appears at the beginning of an input sequence, the first word in the output sequence is ""green."" This suggests that ""dax"" might represent an action or a quality that is always translated to ""green"" regardless of what follows. 
- When ""dax"" follows another word or words, the corresponding position in the output sequence is ""green,"" while the other words determine the remaining colors, such as ""red"" for an unknown word, ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" and others as per the associated color.

Rule: dax -> When ""dax"" is present in an input sequence, the corresponding position in the output is ""green.""",1.0,77,dax
"From the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" triggers the output ""green"" as the first color indicator, regardless of the following word. The subsequent colors in the output seem to depend on the word that follows ""dax"". Here is the breakdown:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green green green.
2. When ""zup"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green yellow.
3. When ""lug"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green blue.
4. When ""dax"" is not the first word but precedes ""zup,"" the initial words have a different color (red) associated, and then the sequence for ""dax zup"" follows as green yellow.
5. When ""dax"" is at the end and follows other words, the preceding words are indicated with red and yellow, and ""dax"" itself ends with green.

Based on this analysis, ""dax"" seems to always translate to ""green"" as the first output, but does not have a consistent rule for generating colors associated with following words beyond that.

Rule: ""dax"" => ""green"" as the first output color; subsequent colors depend on the word following ""dax"" but the rule for those is not clear from the provided examples.",0.9,77,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. Whenever ""dax"" precedes another word, the output starts with ""green."" This suggests that ""dax"" may signal the start of a sequence or command that impacts the color output that follows.
2. The word that follows ""dax"" affects the second part of the output, with each unique word following ""dax"" matching a unique color:
   - ""walm"" after ""dax"" leads to ""green green"" (we can't be sure if ""dax"" or ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""green"").
   - ""zup"" after ""dax"" leads to ""green yellow.""
   - ""lug"" after ""dax"" leads to ""green blue.""
3. When ""walm,"" ""zup,"" or ""dax"" are preceded by another word, such as ""wif,"" the output begins with ""red,"" which might indicate that ""wif"" triggers the ""red"" output or changes the rule.
4. When ""dax"" is followed by another word that has already triggered a certain color when it is at the end of the sequence (like ""zup""), the output seems consistent with the color associated with that word when followed by ""dax"" (in this case, ""yellow"").

Combining these observations, we can infer the following:

- ""dax"" signals the start of a color sequence, with the default first color being ""green.""
- The word immediately following ""dax"" determines the second color in the sequence.
- The presence of ""dax"" does not affect the color outcome of other words in the sequence unless they directly follow ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> Signals the start of a color sequence, defaults to ""green"" as the first color in the output sequence, with the following word determining the second color.",0.8,77,dax
"wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the nonce word 'wif' appears in the input, the word 'red' is outputted.",1.0,77,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and it seems that each word in the input maps to a particular color in the output list. The color red is consistently added to the output sequence each time ""wif"" appears in the input. 
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue,
- ""zup"" to yellow,
- ""dax"" to green, and 
- ""walm"" appears to double the color it follows. So when ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" (green), it results in two greens being added to the output (as seen in the second and third examples).",1.0,77,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, regardless of the context in which it appears.",1.0,77,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red, regardless of the context in which it appears.",1.0,77,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. 

However, it's not just a direct translation to the color ""red"". The rule seems to be that ""wif"" represents a repetition of the color that comes before it, which is ""red"", but it is also red itself. So, in a sequence, for each occurrence of a given color word prior to ""wif"", there is an equivalent repetition of ""red"" in the output.

Here is the rule based on the examples:

- In ""lug zup dax wif"", ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red"" because it's the first instance where ""wif"" occurs.
- In ""dax walm wif walm"", ""wif"" results in doubling the ""red"" as ""wif"" is positioned after two different color words - ""green"" from ""dax"" and another ""green"" from ""walm"" for a total of two ""green"" prior to ""wif"". So, we see the color ""red"" repeated twice in the output.
- In ""zup dax walm lug wif"", ""wif"" follows four color-named words, with the colors being ""yellow,"" ""green,"" ""green,"" and ""blue,"" and thus ""wif"" leads to ""red"" being repeated four times.
- In ""lug wif bluf"", ""wif"" follows a single color-named word ""lug"" with the color ""blue""; therefore, there is one repetition of ""red"" after ""wif"".
- In ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"", ""wif"" follows various color-named words, which in total are five (""yellow,"" ""yellow,"" ""green,"" ""yellow,"" ""green"") leading to ""wif"" being represented as ""red"" repeated five times.

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns of input and output, paying close attention to the context where ""walm"" appears:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output color sequence begins with two greens and then changes (Input 1 & 3).
- When ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence following ""dax,"" the entire output sequence is green (Input 2).
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output sequence is a repeating red (Input 4 & 5).

Taking these points into consideration, we can infer that ""walm"" has a rule-based meaning highly dependent on its positional context and the word that precedes it. Here is an inferred rule for ""walm"":

walm following ""dax"" -> transform subsequent colors to green until a different colored item appears or the end of the sequence is reached.
walm following ""wif"" -> transform subsequent colors to red until a different colored item appears or the end of the sequence is reached.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it changes the color of the output to a specific color based on the preceding word until either a different item appears that dictates a color change or the sequence ends.

Rule: walm -> transforms subsequent outputs to a specific color based on the preceding word until a new color-dictating item appears or the sequence ends.",0.8,77,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word.

Looking at the examples given:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which translates to green), the output is ""green"".
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" (and ""lug"" translates to blue), the output is ""green"" which seems to be an exception to the rule outlined.
- ""wif"" before ""walm"" results in ""red"".
- ""bluf"" before ""walm"" also leads to ""red"".
- Finally, ""zup"" before ""walm"" results in ""yellow"".

Upon further inspection, ""lug dax walm"" resulting in ""blue green green green"" might indicate a special case or an error, as it doesn't follow the general pattern observed in the other examples. Assuming this is an anomaly, we will adhere to the main rule extracted, which is that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that comes before it.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word.",0.8,77,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the color patterns before and after ""walm"" in the provided examples:

1. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green
2. lug dax walm -> blue green green green
3. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow
4. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
5. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow

From these examples, we can detect the following patterns:

- In the first three examples, ""walm"" is followed by a color sequence that starts with green.
- In the fourth and fifth examples, where ""walm"" is at the end or towards the end, we see a sequence starting with red.

However, we still have to determine what dictates whether the sequence following ""walm"" starts with green or red. Here's a possible deduction:

- When ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" or ""dax,"" the output color is green. 
- When ""walm"" is followed by another word or it's towards the end, the color is red.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be related to the following term. Here's the rule attempt:

""Walm"" indicates a pattern change in the sequence based on the following word or its position in the sequence:
- If ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" or ""dax,"" the color is green.
- If ""walm"" is not directly followed by ""lug"" or ""dax,"" the color is red or indicates the continuation of the red pattern possibly until another specified word (like ""lug"" or ""zup"") changes it.

So the rule for ""walm"" might be formulated as:

walm -> Indicates a switch in the color sequence according to the context of the next word or its position: green after ""dax"" or ""lug,"" red otherwise.",0.8,77,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns in which colors correspond to the words in the examples given, while also being aware that the position of ""walm"" might affect its meaning.

Considering the examples and their respective outputs:

1. ""dax walm zup lug dax"" -> ""green green green yellow blue green""
2. ""lug dax walm"" -> ""blue green green green""
3. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow""
4. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""
5. ""wif dax zup walm"" -> ""red green yellow yellow yellow""

Looking at the color outputs corresponding to ""walm"" directly:

1. ""walm"" is followed by ""green""
2. ""walm"" is preceded by ""green green"" and no color after it as it's the last word
3. ""walm"" is followed by ""red""
4. ""walm"" is followed by ""red""
5. ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow""

From these observations, we can see that ""walm"" does not seem to have a consistent color output following it; however, it does seem that ""walm"" might change the color of the word that follows it based on some rule.

Since ""walm"" does not have a fixed color associated with it, and the colors after ""walm"" differ (green, red, yellow), we may infer that ""walm"" serves as a modifier for the next word, possibly indicating a rule that changes based on either the position of ""walm"" in the sequence or the words that come before/after it. However, without a clear pattern of what that rule could be from just these examples (since the colors after ""walm"" are different and do not have an immediately clear relation), we cannot deduce a definitive rule for the meaning of ""walm.""

Considering these examples, the most consistent observation is that ""walm"" alters the expected output in some way, but the precise mechanism is unclear.

Rule: ""walm"" modifies the color associated with the word that follows it in a manner dependent on an unknown rule (contextual or positional).",0.5,77,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's observe its impact on the sequence of colors in each example:

- In the first example, the appearance of ""walm"" changes the following color from ""yellow"" to ""green.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" causes the subsequent ""lug"" to be ""green"" instead of ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" which again becomes ""red"" instead of the expected ""blue.""
- The fourth example shows ""walm"" turning the following ""zup"" into ""red"" instead of the expected ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" results in the next ""zup"" being colored ""yellow"" instead of the initial expectation of ""yellow.""

In these examples, the word ""walm"" appears to change the color of the word that comes after it. The rule is not simply to assign a definitive color like ""green"" or ""red."" Instead, the role of ""walm"" is to modify the output color of the following word in a particular way.

Observing the pattern, we see that the color changes are as follows:

- ""lug"" would typically be blue, but after ""walm,"" it becomes green or red.
- ""zup"" would typically be yellow, but after ""walm,"" it becomes red or yellow.

It's not immediately clear how ""walm"" determines the precise color change, given the provided data. The examples alone do not provide enough consistency to deduce a single rule for the output color, but we can see that ""walm"" affects the color of the word following it. 

The lack of a consistent pattern in these examples makes it challenging to deduce a single, definitive meaning or rule for ""walm."" The rule could be dependent on additional context or requires more examples for accurate deduction. As presented, ""walm"" seems to influence the color of the subsequent word, but without a discernible consistent pattern. 

Based on the given information, our best description would be:

The other words appear to correspond to other colors, such as ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

"bluf -> meaning. The meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be taking on the color of the preceding word but doubling in quantity. For instance:

Rule: ""bluf"" doubles the color of the word before it.",1.0,78,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look for patterns in the provided examples. It appears that ""bluf"" has an effect on the word that immediately precedes it. Let's analyze the examples and see how ""bluf"" changes the output:

Input: lug wif lug bluf
Output: blue red blue blue
- The word ""lug"" followed by ""bluf"" results in ""blue blue.""

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
- The sequence ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow.""

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
- The sequence ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red.""

Input: wif zup dax bluf
Output: red yellow green green
- The sequence ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green.""

Input: dax lug bluf wif
Output: green blue blue red
- Here, even though ""wif"" is at the end of the sequence, ""bluf"" still precedes ""lug,"" resulting in ""blue blue.""

Based on the patterns observed, ""bluf"" seems to duplicate the color indicated by the word that comes before it. Therefore, if a color word is followed by ""bluf,"" the output will be that color word repeated once.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the preceding color word in output.",1.0,78,bluf
"bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word. 

Rule: When you encounter the word ""bluf,"" repeat the color that corresponds to the word that comes before it.",1.0,78,bluf

Rule: If ""bluf"" follows a color-associated word, it repeats that color. For example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"" and ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"".",1.0,78,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that bluf causes the previous word's color to be duplicated. Here's the pattern observed from the examples:

- ""lug bluf"" resulted in ""blue blue"".
- ""wif bluf"" resulted in ""red red"".
- ""dax bluf"" resulted in ""green green"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it duplicates the color of the word before it.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the previous word.",1.0,78,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs:

1. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
2. zup lug walm wif walm -> yellow blue blue blue red red red
3. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
4. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
5. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Looking at the above outputs, after each reaction to ""walm"" we see a repetition of the color associated with the nonce word preceding ""walm"". The input word following ""walm"" doesn't seem to matter, as ""wif"" follows ""walm"" in multiple instances and the colors change depending on the preceding nonce word. Also, the repeats are of a threefold nature, no matter the color. Based on this, a pattern emerges indicating that ""walm"" is a function that triples the color associated with the preceding word:

- ""zup walm"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""lug walm"" gives us ""blue blue blue""
- ""dax walm"" gives us ""green green green""

The rule seems consistent even when ""walm"" appears more than once.

Rule: walm -> Triples the color associated with the previous word in the sequence.",1.0,78,walm
"walm -> repeating the previous color

Rule:
When the nonce word ""walm"" is encountered, it indicates that the color of the previous word should be repeated in the output. The number of repetitions of the color is the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned consecutively after the word.

Let's break down each input and output to support this rule:

1. Input: zup walm wif 
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   Here, ""zup"" is yellow, followed by ""walm"" which repeats the previous color yellow, followed by ""wif"" which is red.

2. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   ""zup"" is yellow, ""lug"" is blue, followed by ""walm"" which repeats the previous color blue, then ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" repeats the red color twice because it occurs twice consecutively.

3. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   ""dax"" is green, followed by ""walm"" which repeats the previous color green, then ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" doesn't have any direct color associated but seems to add another red.

4. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   ""wif"" is red, ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" repeats the previous color blue.

5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   This sequence includes multiple colors with a ""walm"" after the second ""zup"", which causes the color yellow to be repeated four times in a row.

As a rule induction system, I look for patterns and consistency across examples to deduce rules. If new examples were to be added that contradict the established rule, the rule would have to be reevaluated and adjusted.",1.0,78,walm
"From the given examples, let's examine the positions and corresponding outputs associated with the nonce word ""walm"" in each instance:

1. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red

Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" which results in ""yellow yellow yellow red"", where the ""wif"" corresponds to the single ""red"". This suggests that ""walm"" corresponds to the triple ""yellow yellow yellow"".

2. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

In this example, ""walm"" appears twice and is both preceded and followed by different words. ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"" when preceded by ""lug"" and ""red red red"" when followed by ""wif"", suggesting that the context of what comes before or after ""walm"" affects its representation.

3. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

Here, ""walm"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif"", and the output reflects ""green green green red"". This again suggests that ""walm"" corresponds to a triple color before ""red"", which is the output of ""wif"".

4. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue

In this example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue blue blue"", indicating the presence of a pattern based on the preceding word for ""walm"".

5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

This sequence confirms the context dependency because ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"", whereas ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"".

Given the consistent pattern in each case where ""walm"" outputs three of the same color based on the preceding word (yellow for ""zup"", blue for ""lug"", and green for ""dax""), we can deduce that ""walm"" corresponds to a rule where it repeats the color of the output associated with the word that precedes it, three times.

The rule for ""walm"" is:
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color represented by the preceding word three times.",1.0,78,walm
"Based on the given examples, we notice a pattern that correlates with the appearance of ""walm"" in the input and the repetition of the color immediately preceding ""walm"" in the output. Specifically, each time ""walm"" appears, the color word that comes before it is repeated one more time than its previous occurrence in the output sequence. For example, when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times, but the second occurrence of ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated four times in the output.

Let's break down the inputs and outputs to illustrate the rule:

Example 1:
- Input: zup walm wif
- Output: yellow yellow yellow red
(After ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times.)

Example 2:
- Input: zup lug walm wif walm
- Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
(After ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times. Since this is the second occurrence of ""walm,"" the color before it is repeated one more time than in the previous instance.)

Example 3:
- Input: dax walm wif bluf
- Output: green green green red red
(""Dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times.)

Example 4:
- Input: wif lug walm
- Output: red blue blue blue
(""Lug"" converts to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" makes ""blue"" appear three times.)

Example 5:
- Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
- Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
(This sequence showcases the color ""yellow"" being repeated four times after the second ""zup,"" which is followed by ""walm."" This further solidifies the pattern of incrementing the repetition based on the instance of ""walm."")

Therefore, it seems that ""walm"" instructs to repeat the color word that immediately precedes it an additional number of times based on its instance in the sequence, starting with three repetitions for its first instance.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word in the output one more time than the number of times it was previously output directly before the ""walm"" instance, starting with three repetitions for the first instance of ""walm"".",0.9,78,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we must look for patterns in the given input and their corresponding output. Carefully analyzing each example:

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red

Here, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" but ""walm"" also leads to ""yellow.""

Input: zup lug walm wif walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

""lug"" converts to ""blue,"" and the output from ""walm"" is ""blue"" followed by an additional ""red.""

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""walm"" with ""green."" ""bluf"" is likely related to the extra ""red"" in the output.

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

""wif"" equals ""red,"" ""lug"" equals ""blue,"" and ""walm"" gives ""blue.""

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

In this sequence, each input word corresponds to a color, but 'walm' follows the color of the word before it (""zup"" -> ""yellow,"" ""dax"" -> ""green"") and ignores the presence of ""lug"" as it does not immediately precede ""walm"".

From the examples above, we can infer that ""walm"" translates to the same color as the word immediately preceding it, except when the preceding word is ""wif,"" in which case an additional ""red"" is appended to the sequence.

Rule: walm -> the same color as the immediately preceding word, with an additional ""red"" if the preceding word is ""wif"".",0.9,78,walm

"From the given examples, one can infer that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. The surrounding words, ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""bluf"", seem to correspond to their own respective colors, as evidenced by the consistent color outputs associated with them across different examples. Specifically, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""bluf"" also to green considering the last example. With this information, ""dax"" is always followed by the color green, so the rule is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,79,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we need to look at the patterns that emerge concerning when ""dax"" is used in the input and the corresponding output.

Let's examine each input and its output:

1. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red

We can see that ""dax"" is followed by the word ""walm"" and ""lug,"" both resulting in ""green"" in the output.

2. Input: zup dax lug dax
   Output: yellow green blue green

Here, ""dax"" follows ""zup"" and is followed by ""lug,"" resulting in ""green"" and then ""blue."" ""Dax"" is also at the end, resulting again in ""green.""

3. Input: lug dax
   Output: blue green

""Dax"" follows ""lug"" and results in ""green.""

4. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

""Dax"" comes after ""walm"" and the color for ""walm"" is ""yellow,"" but ""dax"" leads to ""green."" It also comes right before the final ""zup.""

5. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green

""Dax"" is between ""zup"" and ""bluf,"" both leading to the color ""green.""

From analyzing the patterns, we see:

- ""Dax"" always results in the color ""green"" in the output, no matter what words precede or follow it.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,79,dax
"Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" is likely to mean ""green."" This is because, in each instance where the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding output. 

Here's the breakdown of the examples to illustrate this:

Rule:
dax -> green",1.0,79,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" translates into the color green. Each instance of ""dax"" in the input results in the word ""green"" in the output. However, there also seems to be a rule that ""dax"" has an effect of repeating the previously mentioned color.

Here are the observations:

1. When ""dax"" follows ""zup,"" which outputs ""yellow,"" the output for ""dax"" is ""green.""
2. When ""dax"" follows ""lug,"" which outputs ""blue,"" the next mention of ""dax"" produces another ""blue,"" then a ""green.""

5. When ""dax"" follows ""bluf,"" it produces an additional ""green.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" outputs ""green"" but also suggests repeating the color that was most recently mentioned before ""dax."" This indicates that ""dax"" could mean repeating the last color output before it but then always results in ""green.""

- In the first example, ""wif"" appears once and is followed by ""red"" once.
- In the second example, ""wif"" appears once and is followed by ""red"" three times, because ""walm"" is also present and seems to translate to ""red red.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to look at repeated patterns in the examples provided. Let's examine each occurrence of ""wif"":

1. When ""wif"" appears at the beginning, as in ""wif zup bluf,"" the output starts with ""red."" It suggests ""wif"" may relate to the color ""red.""
  
2. ""Wif walm"" produces ""red red red."" Since ""walm"" alone also produces an output of ""red,"" suggesting ""wif"" reinforces the ""red"" output, but doesn't necessarily change it.

3. In ""dax walm wif walm,"" the presence of ""wif"" in the middle of the sequence appears to insert an additional sequence of ""red"" into the output, maintaining the pattern of ""red"" assigned to ""walm.""

4. ""Dax wif"" gives us ""green red."" Since ""dax"" alone seems to indicate ""green,"" and by adding ""wif"" results in ""red"" after ""green,"" this consolidates the notion that ""wif"" directly leads to ""red.""

5. ""Dax walm wif bluf,"" with ""wif"" following ""walm,"" yields ""green green green red red."" Since ""bluf"" on its own is associated with ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" with ""red,"" but the output ""red red"" following ""wif"" suggests that ""wif"" may once again be adding a ""red"" element.

Hence, walm -> ""the next color is red.""",1.0,79,walm
"To deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the relationship between the input and output in the given examples. We should review each occurrence of ""walm"" and the corresponding output to determine a pattern.

1. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

2. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

4. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

Observing the input and output pairings:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears, the color ""red"" is repeated in the output sequence.
- The number of times ""red"" is repeated corresponds exactly to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.).

Based on these observations, we can construct the following rule:

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of ""red"" in the output, with the number of repetitions equal to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Written in the requested format:

walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: ""walm"" results in ""red"" being outputted as many times as the position ""walm"" holds in the input sequence.",1.0,79,walm
"Walm -> rule: The word ""walm"" causes the following word to repeat its corresponding color.

Rule:
1. Words without ""walm"" before them have a unique color: ""wif"" is red, ""dax"" is green, ""zup"" is yellow, ""lug"" is blue, and ""bluf"" is yellow. 
2. When ""walm"" comes before a word, that word's output is the repeated color of the said word when it appears without ""walm."" For example, ""wif walm"" yields ""red red red""; since ""wif"" corresponds to red, the word ""walm"" causes the next word to repeat the color red.",1.0,79,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" translates to a sequence of three identical colors. We can see that after ""walm"" is mentioned in the input, the output always consists of three colors in a row that are the same. However, it does not specify what color it translates to, as the three colors change depending on what word precedes ""walm.""

To define the rule more precisely, we can observe what color is repeated thrice after ""walm"":

- After ""wif walm,"" the color is always red (Input 1 and Input 4).
- After ""dax walm,"" the color is green (Input 1).
- There is no clear three-color repetition after ""wif dax walm"" in Input 2; however, the last three colors are green, possibly attributed to ""walm"" following ""dax.""
- After ""zup walm,"" the color is yellow (Input 3 and Input 4).

Rule: ""walm"" -> a sequence of three of the same color, with the specific color determined by the word that comes immediately before ""walm."" The rules for the preceding words would need to be deduced to ascertain what color ""walm"" results in.",0.9,79,walm
"To deduce the rule for the term ""walm"", let's analyze the given outputs with respect to the locations of ""walm"" in the inputs and compare them with consistent colors in the outputs.

1. After ""wif walm"" we have two occurrences of red (""red red"").
2. After ""zup walm lug"" we see three yellows in sequence (""yellow yellow yellow"").
3. After ""wif walm zup"" we see two reds, followed by a yellow (""red red yellow"").
4. When ""walm"" appears after ""zup"", we again see repeated yellows (""yellow yellow yellow"").
5. Similarly, after ""wif walm"" the colors are again red (""red red red"").

One possible rule we can infer from these examples is that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word preceding it. This repetition occurs three times except when ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" which seems to interrupt the pattern and introduce a ""green.""

Based on the examples, the rule appears to be:
- If ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", the output is three reds.
- If ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", the output is three yellows.
- The word following ""walm"" could change the output color again (as seen with ""dax"" after ""walm"").

Rule: walm -> The output repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times, unless that pattern is interrupted by ""dax"" following ""walm"".",0.9,79,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue"".",1.0,80,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in every given example, regardless of the position or context within the sequence of words.",1.0,80,lug

"lug -> blue. Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.",1.0,80,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,80,lug
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the given examples. Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.",1.0,80,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green,"" irrespective of its position in the sequence of words.",1.0,80,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,80,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the given context. Every time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the respective position in the output.",1.0,80,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each nonce word correlates directly to a color.

- In the first example, the output sequence is ""green blue red"" which corresponds to the input sequence ""dax lug wif"".
- The word ""dax"" by itself results in ""green"".
- The word ""dax"" appears in different positions in the input sequence and each time the output color ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output sequence.

Considering these observations, the rules are as follows:
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".

Thus, we can deduce:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,80,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". Looking at the patterns where ""wif"" is used, it is always mapped to ""red"" in the output. The other words in the inputs seem to map to specific colors as well, but the question specifically asks about the word ""wif"". 

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red",1.0,80,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at each example and the corresponding output to see if we can find a pattern:

1. Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
2. Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
3. Input: dax walm wif bluf -> Output: green green green red red 
4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm -> Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
5. Input: dax wif zup -> Output: green red yellow

Examining the patterns, ""wif"" always results in the output ""red."" We also have to take into account the position of ""wif"" in each sequence:

- When ""wif"" follows ""lug"" (lug wif) the output is ""blue red"" but due to the reversal in the input sequence (wif lug), the output is ""red blue.""
- When ""wif"" follows ""zup"" (zup wif), the output is ""yellow red.""
- When ""wif"" follows ""dax walm"" (dax walm wif), an additional ""green"" is output before the ""red,"" suggesting ""dax"" and ""walm"" output ""green.""
- When ""wif"" is between ""dax"" and ""walm"" (dax wif walm), we still get ""green red,"" implying the position after ""dax"" does not change the output of ""wif.""
- When ""wif"" is between ""dax"" and ""zup"" (dax wif zup), we get ""green red yellow,"" consistent with ""dax"" leading to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

Based on these observations, we can conclude:

Rule: the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Therefore: wif -> red",1.0,80,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look at the patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs.

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
Here, ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" resulting in ""red"" before ""blue.""

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
In this case, ""wif"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow"" followed by ""red.""

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red
In this example, ""wif"" is preceded by ""dax walm"" and followed by ""bluf."" The output is ""green green green,"" then ""red"" twice.

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
Here we can see ""wif"" preceded by ""dax"" leads to ""green red,"" and it is followed by ""walm"" yielding ""red,"" then by ""lug"" resulting in ""blue,"" and ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Input: dax wif zup
Output: green red yellow
This shows that when ""dax"" precedes ""wif"", ""green"" is the first color in the output, while ""zup"" after ""wif"" results in ""yellow.""

By examining these examples, we can infer that ""wif"" correlates to the color ""red"" and shifts the pattern of colors. It seems that every occurrence of ""wif"" has a ""red"" positioned right after the corresponding word or sequence in the output. Additionally, the context of the words before and after ""wif"" may determine the colors before ""red.""

Rule: wif -> ""wif"" is translated as ""red"" in the output, with additional colors determined by its preceding and following context.

Note: The full pattern of how ""wif"" affects the surrounding words and colors cannot be fully determined with the given examples. More examples would be needed to fully understand the context-driven rules, but the consistent presence of ""red"" immediately after ""wif"" suggests this basic rule.",0.9,80,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze each output in correspondence with the respective input when ""wif"" is present:

1. ""wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue""
2. ""zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow red""
3. ""dax walm wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green green green red red""
4. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" corresponds to ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""dax wif zup"" corresponds to ""green red yellow""

From the above examples, a pattern can be observed:

- Every time the word ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" is in the output sequence.
- The color that appears immediately after ""red"" correlates with the word that follows ""wif"".
    - In the first example, ""wif lug"" has the output ""red blue"", where ""lug"" seems to correspond with ""blue"".
    - In the third example, ""wif bluf"" has the output ""red red"", possibly meaning ""bluf"" also corresponds to the color ""red"".
    - In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" has ""red red"" in the output, suggesting ""walm"" may correspond to ""red"" as well, following the pattern.

If the above deductions are correct, ""wif"" should introduce the color red, with the subsequent color in the output reflecting the word that comes immediately after ""wif"". In a case where there are multiple instances of ""wif"" or the word following ""wif"" results in ""red"", then it is expressed with a repetition of the color ""red"".

Based on the above observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" and dictates that the next color in the output is dependent on the word that directly follows it. If the word following ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red"" based on the context, the color ""red"" is repeated in the output sequence.",0.8,80,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at each pair of corresponding inputs and outputs to determine what ""wif"" represents:

- When ""lug"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red blue."" In this instance, ""wif"" seems to translate to ""red"".
- When ""wif"" appears alone after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow red."" In this instance, ""wif"" again translates to ""red"".
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" after ""dax walm,"" the output is a repetition of ""green"" followed by ""red red."" Since ""dax"" and ""walm"" consistently translate to ""green,"" and two instances of ""red"" follow ""wif,"" it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to two instances of ""red"" here.
- The sequence ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" results in ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and after ""wif,"" there are three instances of ""red."" However, ""walm"" and ""lug"" translate to colors of their own (""red blue"" and ""yellow yellow,"" respectively, from other examples). This suggests that ""wif"" could mean repeating the color indicated by the next word an additional time, translating here to two additional ""reds"" before then following the pattern for ""lug"" and ""zup.""
- Lastly, in ""dax wif zup,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is followed by one ""red,"" consistent with prior examples where ""wif"" is by itself.

Considering these points, ""wif"" seems to add one or more instances of ""red"" to the output, with the exact number possibly dependent on the context or the words following ""wif."" 

Rule: wif -> Add ""red"" to the output one or more times, potentially repeating the color indicated by the next word an additional time. This is still somewhat abstract, as the correlation is not exact in each case, and context seems to affect the outcome.",0.7,80,wif
"zup -> meaning. Rule: ""zup"" means ""yellow"".",1.0,80,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.",1.0,80,zup

Rule: 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow', irrespective of the context in these examples.",1.0,80,zup

"zup -> yellow

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", I will start by comparing the inputs and outputs to find a pattern. 

In the first input-output pair, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

In other examples, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sentence or the other words around it. There is consistency in every instance of ""bluf"" being translated to ""green"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> green.",1.0,80,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can track the color associated with ""bluf"" in each example when it appears:

1. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
2. wif dax bluf -> red green green
3. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
4. wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> red green yellow red green green
5. zup lug bluf -> yellow blue blue

It seems that whenever ""bluf"" is mentioned, the corresponding color output is ""green."" This is evidenced by every occurrence of ""bluf"" resulting in the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Therefore the rule seems to be:

bluf -> green.",1.0,80,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the given examples and correlate them with their respective outputs. Let's look at each example to determine patterns or consistent associations:

1. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
2. wif dax bluf -> red green green
3. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
4. wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> red green yellow red green green
5. zup lug bluf -> yellow blue blue

In examples 1, 2, and 4, ""bluf"" appears at the end of the input, and in each case, the output color is green. This suggests a possible correlation between ""bluf"" and ""green."" However, in examples 3 and 5, despite ""bluf"" not being the last word, its output still correlates with the color of the word preceding it.

Let's consider ""bluf"" in each position:

- Final Position: ""dax bluf"" -> green green, ""dax bluf"" -> green green. ""bluf"" matches the color of ""dax"" (green).
- Middle Position: ""zup bluf lug"" -> yellow yellow blue, ""lug bluf"" -> blue blue. ""bluf"" matches the color of the word it immediately follows.

From these observations, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word directly preceding it in the sequence. 

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,80,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns of corresponding colors given in the output. We need to identify any consistencies across the different examples to see what ""bluf"" translates to:

Example 1:
Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green

Example 2:
Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green

Example 3:
Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

Example 4:
Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green

Example 5:
Input: zup lug bluf
Output: yellow blue blue

From these examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to a color. Let's find out which one:

- In examples 1, 2, and 4, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green.
- In example 3, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color yellow, which is the same color as the word right before it (""zup"").
- In example 5, ""bluf"" corresponds to blue, again the same color as the word right before it (""lug"").

It seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that the previous word represents. So the rule for ""bluf"" would be: The color representation of ""bluf"" is the same as the color representation of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> same color as the preceding word.",1.0,80,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns that emerge in each of the input-output pairs:

1. ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""
2. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
3. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue""
4. ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green yellow red green green""
5. ""zup lug bluf"" -> ""yellow blue blue""

In the first and fifth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and results in ""yellow"" and ""blue"" respectively. In the first example, ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" and before ""dax,"" showing a repetition of ""yellow"" in the output which indicates that ""bluf"" might be repeating the color of the word preceding it. The same pattern is seen in the fifth example where ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which maps to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" results in ""blue"" as well.

However, in the second, third, and fourth examples, ""bluf"" is at the end of the series and consistently maps to ""green."" This indicates that ""bluf"" has a default color when it is at the end of a list.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" represents the color of the word immediately preceding it, unless it is at the end of the series, in which case it defaults to ""green.""

Based on this rule induction, the meaning of ""bluf"" in the provided context is:

bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word or is ""green"" if it is the last word.",0.9,80,bluf
"walm -> repeats the color word that precedes it thrice.

Rule: If a color word (like ""zup"" for yellow or ""lug"" for blue) immediately precedes ""walm,"" then ""walm"" means to repeat the color stated by the preceding word three times.",1.0,80,walm
"walm -> repetition of the color associated with the previous word. Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word that has been assigned a color, the output is the color associated with the preceding word repeated three times. If ""walm"" is followed by other color-associated words, it adopts the threefold repetition of the last color that appears before ""walm"".",1.0,80,walm
"Rule: walm -> a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. 

The color code seems to be as follows:
- zup -> yellow

- dax -> green

Therefore, when ""walm"" follows one of these nonce words, the output is the color related to that nonce word repeated three times. If ""walm"" is used in the middle of the sequence, its rule still applies until a new color word occurs. Here's the corresponding rule to summarize the meaning of ""walm"":

- The appearance of other words such as ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""walm"" in the input correlates with different colors in the output, but the presence of ""wif"" only correlates with the color ""red.""

Additional observations based on other words:

- The word 'dax' may correspond to 'green', as its presence in the input correlates with a 'green' in the output.
- The word 'bluf' might correspond to 'green' as well, considering its presence alongside 'dax', unless it specifically stands for 'blue' in the third example where it correlates to the presence of 'blue' in the output.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a particular color. Looking at the third and fourth example in particular, where ""bluf"" appears more than once, it suggests that ""bluf"" is consistently linked to the same output color, regardless of its position or repetition within the input.

Let's examine the patterns:

- In the first and fourth examples, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is the last word, and its corresponding output is the last ""yellow,"" but there's an extra ""yellow"" which we can't directly associate with any word. It appears to be associated with ""zup.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the repeated ""blue"" color in the output.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" appears twice and corresponds to two ""yellow"" outputs, yet the last word ""wif"" switches back to ""red"" breaking the previous pattern of color repetition associated with ""bluf.""

Given that ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow"" in other examples, the repeated color in the fifth example should likely be due to ""bluf,"" but the inconsistency introduced by the third and fifth examples makes the determination of ""bluf"" ambiguous. It appears there may not be enough context to determine if ""bluf"" means ""blue"" or ""yellow"" based on the data provided, as the word is linked with each color in different examples.

Nonetheless, the most consistent output color associated with ""bluf"" across the first four examples is ""blue."" However, the fifth example introduces an inconsistency that is difficult to resolve without further information or examples.

   Here, ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green"". After ""walm"", the colors continue to be green, except when a new word is introduced—then the pattern deviates.

2. ""lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". 
   The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and the pattern continues in yellow after ""walm"".

3. ""dax walm wif bluf"" results in ""green green green red red"".
   Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". After ""walm"", the color immediately changes as a new word ""wif"" is introduced, corresponding to ""red"".

4. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"".
   As there is no new word introduced after ""walm"", the color remains ""green"".

5. ""dax walm zup walm"" results in ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"".
   ""Dax"" is ""green"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow"". It seems that the pattern remains yellow after the second ""walm"", even without the introduction of a new word.

From these observations, it appears that ""walm"" in itself does not have a direct color association but might act as a rule modifier. It seems that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the last word before ""walm"" until a new word is introduced or the sequence ends.

Rule: walm -> Extend the color of the preceding word until a new word appears or the sequence ends.",0.9,81,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I'll analyze the output colors corresponding to the examples provided:

1. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

2. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""walm"" cannot be ""yellow"" because it follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

3. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""bluf"" cannot be determined from this line alone.

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

5. Input: dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the last mentioned color (the color output before ""walm"" appears). We can see that every time ""walm"" is mentioned, the last color before it is repeated three times in the output:

- After ""dax"" (green), ""walm"" results in three greens.
- ""zup"" (yellow) followed by ""walm"" results in three yellows.
- ""walm"" does not have its own color but instead repeats the previous color in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last color that appeared three times.

Based on the examples given, this is the rule that I can infer for the nonce word ""walm.""",0.9,81,walm
"In analyzing the given examples, we need to establish a pattern that specifies what ""walm"" means based on its placement and the output produced.

- Example 1: ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" -> ""green green green red blue green green green""
  The word ""walm"" is used twice, and each time the output included three green colors following it, regardless of the other words surrounding it.

- Example 2: ""lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
  The word ""walm"" appears once and again is followed by three yellow colors.

- Example 3: ""dax walm wif bluf"" -> ""green green green red red""
  Once more, the occurrence of ""walm"" produces three greens after it.

- Example 4: ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
  The word ""walm"" without any other context still produces three greens.

- Example 5: ""dax walm zup walm"" -> ""green green green yellow yellow yellow""
  Each instance of ""walm"" is followed by a color occurring three times, which matches the pattern observed in other examples.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" dictates that the following color word be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the following color word three times.",0.8,81,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" based on the given examples, we can analyze the pattern of outputs corresponding to each input in which ""walm"" appears.

Example 1:
Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output: green green green red blue green green green
Here, ""walm"" is followed by the color sequence ""green green"" both times it appears.

Example 2:
Input: lug zup walm lug 
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
In this instance, ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow yellow"".

Example 3:
Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red
Again, ""walm"" is followed by a pattern of ""green green"".

Example 4:
Input: dax walm 
Output: green green green
Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""green"".

Example 5:
Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
The word ""walm"" is followed first by ""green green"" and then by ""yellow yellow"" once ""zup"" is introduced between ""walm"" occurrences.

Based on the outputs, the occurrences of ""walm"" always lead to at least two instances of the same color following it. The color that follows seems to be dependent on the word that precedes ""walm"". For instance:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the color green is repeated.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the color yellow is repeated.

Using these observations, let's establish a general rule.

Rule: ""walm"" -> The word ""walm"" induces a repetition of the color associated with the directly preceding word. If ""dax"" is the preceding word, then the color green is repeated. If ""zup"" is the preceding word, then the color yellow is repeated. The number of repetitions seems to be two based on the given examples. 

However, there are not enough examples to determine the color repetition for other words that might precede ""walm"", nor is it clear what happens if ""walm"" is the first word in the sequence or if there are no words preceding it.",0.8,81,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look at the pattern of inputs and outputs to understand the context and use of the word. Examining the information provided, the word ""walm"" appears in each input and is followed or preceded by various other words. Let's focus on the outputs that correspond to inputs containing ""walm"" to see if we can find a pattern.

Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output: green green green red blue green green green

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

From these examples, we can notice the following:

1. ""walm"" is always followed by a series of three of the same color in the output, regardless of the input words that precede or follow it. This repetition of three does not appear in any of the examples when ""walm"" is not present.
2. The color that follows ""walm"" is not the same in all examples, indicating that ""walm"" does not correlate to one specific color but possibly the action of repeating a color.
3. ""dax"" is always followed by the color green, as seen in the outputs when it precedes ""walm.""
4. The colors yellow, red, and blue do not seem to have a direct connection to the word ""walm"" but rather to other words in the input (""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" etc.).

Based on these observations, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color that directly follows the word ""dax"" in the output, which is green. Specifically, it seems to imply the repetition of the preceding color (which is green when following “dax”) three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color to be repeated three times, where the preceding color directly follows the word ""dax"" in the output (green in all instances here).",0.8,81,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""lug,"" we can examine each example to see what output is associated with its presence and position relative to other words.

Example 1:
- Input: wif walm lug bluf
- Output: red red red blue blue

Example 2:
- Input: lug walm wif bluf
- Output: blue blue blue red red

Example 3:
- Input: lug zup
- Output: blue yellow

Example 4:
- Input: lug wif dax
- Output: blue red green

Example 5:
- Input: wif lug zup bluf
- Output: red blue yellow yellow

In each example where ""lug"" appears, the color ""blue"" is produced:

- In examples 1 and 5, ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which yields ""blue blue""; this could suggest ""lug"" might equal ""blue"", and ""bluf"" has a meaning that can also yield ""blue"".
- In example 2, ""lug"" comes before ""walm"" (which was associated with ""red"" in the first example) and still produces ""blue"".
- In examples 3 and 4, regardless of the word following ""lug,"" the output color ""blue"" is associated with it.

The consistent pattern across all examples is that whenever ""lug"" appears, it results in the color ""blue"" in the output, irrespective of its position or the presence of other surrounding words.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,82,lug
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""lug"" seems to consistently correspond to the color ""blue"" in the output. Here's the evidence supporting this conclusion:

- In every instance where ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output.
- ""lug"" is the only word in the input that consistently results in ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position or the presence of other words.
- Other words match with different colors (""wif"" with ""red"", ""walm"" with ""red"", ""bluf"" with ""blue"" redundantly, ""zup"" with ""yellow"", and ""dax"" with ""green""), but ""lug"" only matches with ""blue"".

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,82,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"", regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,82,lug
"From the examples given, it appears that the word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" is present in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output. Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,82,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. When ""lug"" appears, the output has colors that correspond with the other words.
2. The sequence of the colors in the output seems to correlate with the sequence of the words in the input.

Matching inputs to outputs:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""walm"" might correspond to ""red,"" but it always appears with ""wif,"" which also corresponds to ""red,"" so there is not enough information to definitively assign a color to ""walm"" alone, yet it seems consistent when combined with ""wif.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when it follows unique words and doesn't repeat like in the last example where ""bluf"" came after ""wif lug zup"" and the output was ""red blue yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" changed its color based on the preceding words (in this case, ""lug"" changes the color of ""bluf"").
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

If we ignore the behavior of ""bluf"" in the last example where it repeats the yellow output, we don't have a definite rule for it.

By analyzing these patterns, the rule seems to be that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" and changes the color of the next word(s) according to some pattern. However, there isn't enough information to discern the exact rule affecting how words after ""lug"" are colored, if there is any. It could be random or dependent on the specific combination of words which we can't infer with the limited examples provided.

Based on the data, the rule we can induce is:

Rule: lug -> blue",0.9,82,lug
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"". Each other unique word corresponds to a different color: ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue"". No matter the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence, the output is always ""green."" Hence, the rule is as follows:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" represents the color green.",1.0,82,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"". Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green"".",1.0,82,dax
"Based on the examples provided where the word ""dax"" corresponds to a certain color in the output:

1. ""dax zup wif zup"" -> ""green yellow red yellow""
2. ""dax zup lug"" -> ""green yellow blue""
3. ""zup dax"" -> ""yellow green""
4. ""lug dax"" -> ""blue green""
5. ""lug dax"" -> ""blue green""

It can be deduced that the word ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color green in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,82,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. When ""dax"" is used in an input sequence, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output sequence.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,82,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it is reasonable to induce the following rule:

dax -> green

Each example associates the nonce word ""dax"" with the color green irrespective of the position of the word in the input sequence or the other words present. Here is the mapping from the input to the output:

- ""dax zup wif zup"" -> green yellow red yellow
- ""dax zup lug"" -> green yellow blue
- ""zup dax"" -> yellow green
- ""lug dax"" -> blue green
- ""lug dax"" -> blue green

Rule: dax corresponds to the color green.",1.0,82,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce a pattern for the nonce word ""wif.""

In the first example:
- ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red,"" where the color for ""dax"" is green and ""walm"" is green as well. However, ""wif"" is translated to red despite ""walm"" being green.

In the second example:
- ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" translates to ""yellow red red yellow blue,"" where ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" is red, and ""lug"" is blue. We see here that ""wif"" is associated with red again.

In the third example:
- ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" translates to ""red red green green red red red blue red,"" where ""bluf"" translates to red, ""dax"" to green, ""walm"" remains green, and ""lug"" is blue. ""wif"" correlates with red, just as in the previous examples.

In the fourth example:
- ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue green green,"" where ""lug"" translates to blue, ""dax"" to green, and ""bluf"" to green here. Again, ""wif"" is translated to red.

In the fifth example:
- ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red,"" where ""dax"" translates to green, ""bluf"" to red, and ""wif"" also to red.

From these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red

This rule states that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color red in the provided context.",1.0,82,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look for patterns in the input and output.

First, observe that ""wif"" always translates to ""red."" However, we must ensure that ""wif"" itself is not context-dependent and that it consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sentence. Here's what we see:

- ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red""
- ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" -> ""yellow red red yellow blue""
- ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" -> ""red red green green red red red blue red""
- ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue red blue green green""
- ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""

In all cases, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" There is no evident change in the meaning of ""wif"" based on its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,82,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the provided examples and outputs together. It appears that each word in the input corresponds to a particular color in the output. Let's try to find a pattern for ""wif"":

1. dax walm wif -> green green green red
2. zup wif bluf zup lug -> yellow red red yellow blue
3. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> red red green green red red red blue red
4. lug wif lug dax bluf -> blue red blue green green
5. dax wif bluf -> green red red

Looking at all the instances where ""wif"" appears, the output is always ""red."" No matter the position ""wif"" has in the sentence or the context it's in, the output color associated with it is consistent. Thus, based on these examples, ""wif"" directly translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,82,wif
"Reviewing the examples provided, let's examine the occurrences of the word ""wif"" and the colors linked to it:

- In the first example, ""dax walm wif"" corresponds to ""green green green red."" Here the word ""wif"" is associated with the color red.
  
- In the second example, ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" results in ""yellow red red yellow blue."" Again, ""wif"" correlates with the color red.

- In the third example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" generates ""red red green green red red red blue red."" Here, ""wif"" appears three times, each associated with the color red.

- In the fourth example, ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" correlates with ""blue red blue green green."" ""Wif"" is linked with the color red once more.

- Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax wif bluf"" leads to ""green red red."" Here as well, ""wif"" is matched with red.

Given these examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position within the sequence or the surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,82,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it is possible to infer that the nonce word ""wif"" produces the output ""red"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence. Comparing instances where ""wif"" appears, there is a consistent output associated with it regardless of the other words around it. Thus, the rule I can deduce is:

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,82,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can infer the following rules:

- The word ""zup"" always produces the output ""yellow"".
- The word ""wif"" produces the output ""red"".
- The word ""lug"" when followed by ""zup"" produces ""blue"".
- The word ""dax"" produces the output ""green"".
- The word ""walm"" produces a repeating output of ""red"", with the number of reds corresponding to the number of ""walm"" in sequence.
- The word ""bluf"" produces the output ""green"" when it's followed by another ""bluf"" or ""dax"". When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", it appears to produce ""yellow""; however, there is only one example of this, so it might not be a conclusive rule.

From the above, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be consistent across all examples:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,82,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that 'zup' consistently translates to the color 'yellow'. Here are the supporting examples:

- Whenever 'zup' appears alone or at the start of a sequence, the output is 'yellow'.
- When 'zup' appears in the middle of other nonce words, the output corresponding to 'zup' is still 'yellow'.
- The position of 'zup' within a sequence does not seem to influence its meaning.

Here's the conclusion for the rule regarding 'zup':

Rule: zup -> 'yellow'",1.0,82,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word 'zup' consistently translates to 'yellow'. Each input that contains the word 'zup' corresponds to an output with the word 'yellow' in the same position. There is no variation in the output regardless of the context in which 'zup' appears. Therefore, the rule is straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,82,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""zup,"" let's analyze the input and outputs provided.

Input: zup  
Output: yellow  
Rule: zup corresponds to yellow.

Input: zup wif lug zup walm  
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow  
Rule: Following the same logic as before, zup corresponds to yellow. However, this example indicates that additional words may also have corresponding colors, and repetition of the word increases the repetition of the color in the output. The context gives no meaning to ""wif"" or ""lug,"" which also appear in the output as red and blue, respectively, but occur only once regardless of their position among repeated ""zup.""

Input: dax zup dax  
Output: green yellow green  
Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to green while ""zup"" continues to correspond to yellow.

Input: zup bluf wif walm  
Output: yellow yellow red red red  
Rule: As established, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""wif"" to red, with a new term ""bluf"" leading to a repeated yellow. ""Walm"" may indicate a repetition in the pattern based on its position or an instruction to repeat the previous color(s).

Input: zup dax bluf  
Output: yellow green green  
Rule: ""Zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" seems to indicate repeating the last color mentioned (green in this case).

Given the information above:

zup -> meaning: ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.",0.9,82,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the following rules can be inducted for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"":

1. When ""zup"" occurs by itself or is the first word in a sequence, it translates to ""yellow.""
2. When ""zup"" follows other words, it not only translates itself to ""yellow"" but also seems to change the color associated with the previous word to the color immediately following ""zup"" in the base sequence (for instance, ""red"" becomes ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup""). This is observed in the first example where ""zup"" follows ""lug"" (which presumably means ""red"") and both translate to ""yellow."" A similar transformation happens in the second set, where ""wif walm"" presumably translates to ""red red red,"" but when preceded by ""zup bluf,"" it changes to ""yellow yellow red red red.""

However, this rule is not entirely consistent, as in the third example, ""zup dax"" translates to ""yellow green"" rather than ""yellow yellow."" This suggests that ""dax"" may be an exception to the rule or that there are additional contextual factors not evident in the limited examples provided.

Therefore, the most consistent rule that can be drawn from these examples is:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and may affect the color translation of the words immediately before it.

In more rigid terms: zup -> ""yellow"".",0.7,82,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can determine that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"". This can be deduced by observing that every time the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: bluf -> green.",1.0,82,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to analyze each example to see what output corresponds to the presence of ""bluf"" and how it relates to the other words and their associated output colors.

Let's analyze each example in the provided order:

1. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""walm"" has no explicit output, but given that the sequence ends with three greens, and we've seen ""dax"" is ""green,"" perhaps ""walm"" corresponds to the extra ""green.""

2. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue,"" suggesting it may translate to ""blue.""

3. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - The sequence ends with ""green,"" suggesting ""bluf"" could be ""green.""

4. dax bluf -> green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""bluf"" is followed by ""green,"" reinforcing the suggestion that ""bluf"" could mean ""green.""

5. dax wif bluf -> green red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - The sequence ends with ""red,"" but we know from example 2 that ""bluf"" doesn't output ""red"" when followed by ""lug.""

From the above analysis, we can posit two main observations:

- In examples 3 and 4, ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- In example 2, ""bluf"" potentially corresponds to ""blue,"" but this is contradicted by examples 3 and 4.

Given these observations, the most consistent rule for ""bluf"" across all examples seems to be that it translates to ""green,"" as there is no instance where ""bluf"" results in an output other than ""green.""

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> green",0.8,82,bluf
"From the examples given, we can try to determine the meaning of ""bluf"" by examining the context in which it appears and its corresponding outputs. Let's analyze:

1. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
2. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue
3. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
4. dax bluf -> green green
5. dax wif bluf -> green red red

We can notice a pattern where the output directly follows ""bluf"". Let's focus on ""bluf"" and the color that appears after it:

1. bluf -> red 
2. bluf -> blue 
3. bluf -> green
4. bluf -> green 
5. bluf -> red

It's clear that ""bluf"" is directly associated with a color in the output. However, it does not consistently correspond to the same color. It appears the preceding word influences the color that follows ""bluf"":

- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is red.
- When ""lug"" or nothing precedes ""bluf,"" the output is blue.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is green.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is green.

It seems likely that ""bluf"" is a function of the word that comes before it. Based on the information given, we can propose the following rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the word directly preceding it, mapping to a specific color output.",0.8,82,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns and how they correspond to the output colors:

1. When ""wif bluf dax walm"" corresponds to ""red red green green green,"" we can observe that ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" and results in ""red green.""

2. When ""lug wif lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red blue blue,"" we see that ""bluf"" at the end results in ""blue.""

3. When ""zup dax bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow green green,"" ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in ""green.""

4. When ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green,"" ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the result is also ""green.""

5. When ""dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green red red,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red.""

From these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" results in ""green"" when it follows ""dax"" and ""red"" when it follows ""wif."" When it appears at the end, as in example 2, ""bluf"" results in ""blue."" There doesn’t seem to be enough information to determine if ""bluf"" results in ""blue"" strictly because it is at the end or because it follows ""lug,"" but we can certainly determine the relationship with ""dax"" and ""wif.""

Based on the given examples, here is the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf -> ""green"" when it follows ""dax,"" ""red"" when it follows ""wif,"" and potentially ""blue"" when it is the last in the series.",0.7,82,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,0.0,82,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we need to carefully examine each input and the corresponding output to look for patterns. 

1. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red
2. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
3. lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue
4. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
5. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow

Looking at the outputs, ""walm"" consistently results in the output ""blue."" Even when it is placed at different positions in the inputs, the output corresponding to ""walm"" does not change. This regularity suggests that ""walm"" maps to a particular color, regardless of its position or surrounding words. 

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> blue",1.0,82,walm
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of input words translates to a specific color in the output. To deduce what the nonce word ""walm"" means, we need to look at the color it translates to in each instance.

In all examples provided:

- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"".
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"".
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
- ""dax"", when it appears, translates to ""green"".

Now let's focus on the appearances of ""walm"":

1. In the first input, ""lug walm zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow red"". Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" and translates to the same color as ""lug"" (blue).

2. In the second input, ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue"". Here, ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" and before ""lug"", translating to the same color as ""wif"" (red).

3. In the third input, ""lug walm wif lug"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue"". Here, ""walm"" is again, followed by ""wif"" and translates to the same color as ""lug"" (blue).

4. In the fourth input, ""dax lug walm zup wif"" translates to ""green blue blue blue yellow red"". Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" and translates to the same color as ""lug"" (blue).

5. In the fifth input, ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow"". Here, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and translates to the same color as ""wif"" (red).

From these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" translates to the same color as the word that immediately precedes it. If no word precedes it, we do not have examples of what happens; however, based on the given data, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> ""meaning"": Same color as the word immediately before it.",1.0,82,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can try to infer the meaning or the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" by looking at the positional changes and the resultant color changes in the output.

1. When the word ""walm"" appears in different positions, it always results in the word ""blue"" appearing in the output immediately after it. This can be seen in the following instances:
   - Input: lug walm zup wif -> Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   - Input: zup wif walm lug -> Output: yellow red red red blue
   - Input: lug walm wif lug -> Output: blue blue blue red blue
   - Input: dax lug walm zup wif -> Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   - Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow

2. In each case, ""walm"" does not seem to affect the color that comes before it; rather, it only affects the color that comes immediately after it.

3. The presence of ""walm"" does not appear to change the patterns or colors associated with other words, as the color patterns for other words such as ""lug,"" ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax"" remain consistent whether ""walm"" is present in the sequence or not. For example, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to blue except with another rule applied, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow at the time of cutoff.

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the next word in the sequence to be translated as ""blue,"" regardless of its usual corresponding color.",1.0,82,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the given pairs of inputs and outputs:

1. ""lug walm zup wif"" → ""blue blue blue yellow red""
2. ""zup wif walm lug"" → ""yellow red red red blue""
3. ""lug walm wif lug"" → ""blue blue blue red blue""
4. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" → ""green blue blue blue yellow red""
5. ""wif walm dax zup"" → ""red red red green yellow""

We can start by identifying consistently paired elements. It seems that ""lug"" pairs with ""blue"", ""zup"" pairs with ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" pairs with ""red."" 

""lug walm zup wif"" has ""walm"" between ""lug"" and ""zup"", and the corresponding output colors are ""blue blue blue yellow."" Since ""zup wif"" consistently translates to ""yellow red"", we can ignore that part. The repeated ""blue"" suggests that ""walm"" is associated with the same color as ""lug,"" which is ""blue"".

Looking at other sequences, such as ""zup wif walm lug"" which translates to ""yellow red red red blue,"" we can observe that ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" (which is ""blue"") and therefore ""walm"" takes on the red of ""wif"" that precedes it, resulting in ""red red"".

In the case of ""dax lug walm zup wif"", it becomes ""green blue blue blue yellow red."" Since we know the pairing for ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif,"" we can deduce that ""dax"" pairs with ""green"" and ""walm"" again takes on the same color as ""lug"" that preceded it with ""blue.""

Given that ""walm"" consistently changes to match the color of the word that precedes it, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: ""walm"" -> the color associated with the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""lug,"" then ""walm"" is blue; if ""wif,"" then red, etc.",0.8,82,walm
"From the provided examples, we can infer the following:

- ""lug walm zup wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue yellow red""
- ""zup wif walm lug"" corresponds to ""yellow red red red blue""
- ""lug walm wif lug"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red blue""
- ""dax lug walm zup wif"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue yellow red""
- ""wif walm dax zup"" corresponds to ""red red red green yellow""

To determine the meaning of ""walm"", let's look for patterns. In each sequence, the presence of ""walm"" seems to correspond to repeated instances of ""blue"" before we encounter a different color. Specifically, ""walm"" is followed by ""blue"" until a different word is encountered, after which it appears to transition to another color based on the new word:

- ""lug walm zup wif"" => ""blue blue blue yellow red""
- ""zup wif walm lug"" => ""yellow red red red blue""
- ""lug walm wif lug"" => ""blue blue blue red blue""

Given this pattern, ""walm"" appears to cause a repetition of the color coded by the word immediately preceding it. Therefore:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word until a different non-walm word occurs. If the preceding word is also ""walm,"" then continue repeating the color corresponding to the word before the first ""walm.""",0.8,82,walm
"lug -> ""blue""

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.",1.0,83,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of the context in which it appears.",1.0,83,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue.",1.0,83,lug
"Rule: lug -> blue

Given the examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position in a sequence or the context provided by surrounding words.",1.0,83,lug
"Based on the examples provided, my rule induction for the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" is:

Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Here's how I reached that conclusion:

- In every input instance where the word ""lug"" appears, the output contains the color ""blue.""
- The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input or the other words around it.

Therefore: lug -> blue.",1.0,83,lug
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the outputs provided. Every time ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" follows in the output sequence.",1.0,83,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs. Here is the rule with the given meaning:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,83,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" correlates with the output ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Regardless of the other words present (""wif,"" ""walm,"" ""zup,"" ""lug""), whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Other words are consistently associated with other colors (for instance, ""walm"" with ""red"" and ""lug"" with ""blue""), which indicates that each word, including ""dax,"" maps to a specific color in this system.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,83,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Therefore, the rule appears to be that whenever the word ""dax"" is present in the input, the output is ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,83,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Whenever the word ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, the corresponding output is ""green"".",1.0,83,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" can be inferred as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,83,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,83,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to the word ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,83,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following mappings:

- wif always maps to red.
- walm seems to map to red in the second example but to green in the fourth example.
- dax maps to green.
- zup maps to yellow.
- lug maps to blue.

Regardless of the position in the sequence, ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red"". However, it is unclear why ""walm"" changes from red to green in the given examples; there could be a contextual rule that is not apparent from the examples provided.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,83,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can infer that each nonce word corresponds to a color:

- Every instance of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""walm"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""green"" when following ""wif"", but ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" even when not following ""wif"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" both when it precedes and follows ""wif"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" regardless of its position in relation to ""wif"".

Given this pattern, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,83,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" seems consistently to correspond with the color ""yellow.""

Here are the examples abstracted to show the rule:

Input: zup wif dax walm lug  
Output: yellow red green green green blue  
Pattern: zup corresponds to yellow, wif corresponds to red, dax corresponds to green, and lug corresponds to blue. The word walm doesn't correspond clearly to any single output; however, based on this example alone, walm follows dax which is green twice and is followed by a green, so it may represent repetition of the previous color.

Input: zup dax wif  
Output: yellow green red  
Pattern: zup corresponds to yellow, dax again to green, wif again to red.

Input: zup bluf lug zup  
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow  
Pattern: zup corresponds to yellow, bluf corresponds to yellow, lug corresponds to blue, and the repetition of zup again corresponds to yellow.

Input: zup wif lug dax  
Output: yellow red blue green  
Pattern: We again see zup to yellow, wif to red, lug to blue, and dax to green.

Input: dax walm zup lug  
Output: green green green yellow blue  
Pattern: dax leads to green, and walm again seems to repeat the previous color, leading to a succession of greens. Per the established pattern, zup corresponds to yellow, and lug corresponds to blue.

From these observations, we come to determine the meaning of the word ""zup"":

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,83,zup
"Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Every instance where ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, ""zup"" means ""yellow.""

zup -> yellow",1.0,83,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we should compare the input strings and look for patterns in the corresponding output color sequences. Let's lay out the information in a table for comparison.

| Input Phrase(s)                    | Output Color Sequence(s)                 |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| zup wif dax walm lug               | yellow red green green green blue        |
| zup dax wif                        | yellow green red                         |
| zup bluf lug zup                   | yellow yellow blue yellow                |
| zup wif lug dax                    | yellow red blue green                    |
| dax walm zup lug                   | green green green yellow blue            |

From the examples, we can infer the following:

- ""zup"" at the beginning of an input always results in ""yellow"" as the first color in the output.
- ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red.""
- ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green"" when it follows ""wif"" or ""zup.""
- ""walm"" relates to the color ""green.""
- ""lug"" correlates with the color ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" might correlate with the color ""yellow"" when it's not at the beginning, but this pattern is less clear because there's only one example containing ""bluf.""
- When ""zup"" appears again inside the input, it results in ""yellow"" in a position matching its place in the input sequence.

Based on the information given, ""zup"" consistently correlates with the color ""yellow"" when it is at the beginning of the input sequence or when it reappears within the sequence.

Rule: ""zup"" -> ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" appears in an input string, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output sequence at the same relative position.",1.0,83,zup
"From the provided examples, it seems that `zup` corresponds to the color 'yellow'. Each input containing the word 'zup' results in 'yellow' appearing in the output at the same position. Here are the observations that lead to this conclusion:

- When 'zup' is at the beginning of an input sequence, 'yellow' is at the beginning of the output sequence.
- When 'zup' is in the middle of an input sequence, 'yellow' appears at the corresponding position in the output sequence.
- When 'zup' appears more than once in an input sequence, 'yellow' appears multiple times in the output sequence at the corresponding positions.

Based on these observations, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: zup -> 'yellow'",1.0,83,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. To confirm the rule, we look at all instances where ""zup"" appears and the output associated with it:

Input: zup wif dax walm lug -> Output: yellow red green green green blue
- ""zup"" is followed by four colors implying it could be ""yellow"".

Input: zup dax wif -> Output: yellow green red
- Again, ""zup"" comes before colors suggesting it could be ""yellow"".

Input: zup bluf lug zup -> Output: yellow yellow blue yellow
- ""zup"" appears at the beginning, middle, and end of the sequence, and each time it corresponds with ""yellow"".

Input: zup wif lug dax -> Output: yellow red blue green
- Once more, ""zup"" is followed by colors, and it corresponds to ""yellow"".

Input: dax walm zup lug -> Output: green green green yellow blue
- ""zup"" is preceded and followed by different color names and in this sequence corresponds to the color ""yellow"".

Since in every instance where ""zup"" appears the associated color in the output is ""yellow"", we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,83,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""
2. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
3. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
4. ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" -> ""blue green green yellow blue red""
5. ""zup bluf wif"" -> ""yellow yellow red""

Here are some observations:

- In examples 1 and 2, ""wif"" appears both times, and its output color is always ""red.""
- In examples 3 and 5, ""zup"" appears both times, and its output color is consistently ""yellow.""
- In example 4, ""lug"" appears twice and its output color is ""blue"" both times, while ""dax"" has the consistent color ""green.""

Now, let's focus on the outputs with ""bluf"" and see if we can find a consistent pattern. In every example where ""bluf"" is used, its corresponding output color is always the same color as the word that immediately precedes it:

1. ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red"" (The color ""red"" comes after ""wif"" and is repeated after ""bluf."")
2. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" (The color ""red"" comes after ""wif"" and is repeated after ""bluf."")
3. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"" (The color ""yellow"" comes after ""zup"" and is repeated after ""bluf."")
4. ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" -> ""blue green green yellow blue red"" (The color ""green"" comes after ""dax"" and is repeated after ""bluf."")
5. ""zup bluf wif"" -> ""yellow yellow red"" (The color ""yellow"" comes after ""zup"" and is repeated after ""bluf."")

Based on these observations, the rule of ""bluf"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the word that comes right before it in the list.

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: Repeats the color of the previous word. Rule: The output color for ""bluf"" matches the output color for the immediately preceding word.",1.0,83,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe the following:

- The word bluf always results in the output of a color repeated twice.
- The word before bluf determines the color that is repeated.

More specifically:
- ""dax wif bluf"" leads to ""green red red"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is repeated twice due to ""bluf.""
- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" further underlining that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" causes the repetition.
- ""zup bluf"" gives ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" doubled by ""bluf.""
- ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" provides each corresponding color, with ""bluf"" causing the repetition for green (""dax"").
- ""zup bluf wif"" ends with ""yellow yellow red"" where ""zup"" is doubled to ""yellow yellow"" by ""bluf,"" followed by the singular red for ""wif.""

Therefore, bluf appears to be a function that doubles the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> doubles the color associated with the immediately preceding word.",1.0,83,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be related to color. In every instance, ""bluf"" is associated with a repetition of the color indication of the previous word:

1. ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red"": ""bluf"" takes the color of ""wif"", which is red.
2. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"": ""bluf"" repeats the indicated color of ""wif"", which is red.
3. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"": ""bluf"" repeats the indicated color of ""zup"", which is yellow.
4. ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" -> ""blue green green yellow blue red"": Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and repeats its color, which is green.
5. ""zup bluf wif"" -> ""yellow yellow red"": ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup"", before ""wif"" changes the sequence to red.

Rule: bluf -> The rule for ""bluf"" is that it repeats the color associated with the word that directly precedes it.",1.0,83,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns corresponding to each appearance of the word and its associated output. Let's analyze the examples given:

- In the first example, ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red."" Since ""dax"" and ""wif"" both appear in other examples and translate to ""green"" and ""red"" respectively, we can infer that ""bluf"" must also correspond to ""red.""
- The second example, ""wif bluf,"" leads to ""red red,"" which supports the theory that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" since we already know that ""wif"" is ""red.""
- In the third example, ""zup bluf,"" outputs ""yellow yellow."" From this, we can determine that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the repetition suggests that ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow"" in this context. This initially seems at odds with our previous deduction.
- The fourth example, ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif,"" transforms into ""blue green green yellow blue red."" Here, we see that ""dax"" is adjacent to ""bluf"" just as in the first example, and both times they have resulted in ""green."" Meanwhile, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and given the previous usages, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
- The last example, ""zup bluf wif,"" converts into ""yellow yellow red."" This reconfirms that ""zup"" has consistently meant ""yellow"" and ""wif"" has consistently meant ""red."" 

Upon comparing these examples, it's apparent that ""bluf"" does not correspond to one consistent color but seems to mimic the color of the word that immediately precedes it. In the first example, it follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" is ""green."" This pattern is replicated in the other examples when directly preceded by ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow.""

Consequently, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that comes directly before it. If ""bluf"" were to follow ""lug,"" it should translate to ""blue,"" following the logic established by the examples.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,83,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns in the input-output pairs:

- Whenever ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green red.""
- Whenever ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
- Whenever ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- When the input is ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif,"" the colors ""green"" and ""yellow"" are repeated from prior patterns after ""dax"" and ""zup,"" respectively, and ""blue"" appears after ""lug.""
- When the input is ""zup bluf wif,"" the colors ""yellow"" correspond with ""zup,"" and the color ""red"" corresponds with ""wif.""

Based on these patterns, it seems that the color output after ""bluf"" depends on the color associated with the word preceding ""bluf."" Here is a possible association based on the given examples:

- ""dax"" -> ""green""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""lug"" does not precede ""bluf,"" but based on the pattern, it likely corresponds to ""blue.""

Therefore, it appears that ""bluf"" serves as a repeater of the color association of the word that immediately precedes it. If we consider that ""bluf"" is the action causing the preceding word's color to repeat, we could express the rule as follows:

Rule: bluf repeats the color output associated with the word that precedes it.",0.9,83,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I will analyze the outputs associated with each appearance of ""walm"" in the inputs.

- ""lug"" consistently leads to a ""blue"" output.
- ""wif"" consistently leads to a ""red"" output.
- ""dax"" consistently leads to a ""green"" output.
- ""zup"" leads to a ""yellow"" output in its one appearance.

When ""walm"" appears in a sequence, the output repeats the color associated with the previous word, three times. This pattern holds across all the provided examples. For instance:

- ""lug wif walm"" outputs ""blue red red red"": ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" repeats it three times.
- ""dax walm"" gives ""green green green"": ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" repeats it three times.
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"": ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" repeats it three times.
- ""zup wif dax walm lug"" gives ""yellow red green green green blue"": after ""dax"" which is green, ""walm"" repeats the green color three times.
- ""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue"": ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" repeats it three times.

Based on this pattern, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,83,walm
"Observing the patterns, it seems that the word ""walm"" refers to a repetition of a color that is associated with the preceding nonce word. Here's the correlation based on the given examples:

- ""lug"" correlates with blue, as seen in ""lug walm"" resulting in ""blue blue blue.""
- ""dax"" correlates with green, as seen in ""dax walm"" resulting in ""green green green.""
- ""wif"" correlates with red, as seen in ""wif walm"" resulting in ""red red red.""
- When ""walm"" follows two or more nonce words, it repeats the color associated with the directly preceding nonce word, as indicated in ""zup wif dax walm lug"" which results in ""yellow red green green green blue.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be to repeat the color associated with the directly preceding nonce word three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding nonce word three times.",1.0,83,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the same color word multiple times. The number of repetitions corresponds to the number of letters in the word that comes immediately before ""walm."" 

Here’s the breakdown based on the examples:

1. ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red"": ""wif"" has 3 letters, so ""walm"" translates to ""red"" repeated 3 times.
2. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"": ""dax"" has 3 letters, so ""walm"" translates to ""green"" repeated 3 times.
3. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red"": ""wif"" has 3 letters, so ""walm"" translates to ""red"" repeated 3 times.
4. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> ""yellow red green green green blue"": ""dax"" has 3 letters, so ""walm"" translates to ""green"" repeated 3 times.
5. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"": ""lug"" has 3 letters, so ""walm"" translates to ""blue"" repeated 3 times.

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color related to the word immediately preceding it, and it repeats as many times as there are letters in that word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word as many times as there are letters in that preceding word.",1.0,83,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples. 

1. ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red.""
2. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green.""
3. ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red.""
4. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red green green green blue.""
5. ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue.""

From the examples given, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that precedes it. Let's examine the patterns:

- ""lug"" alone results in ""blue,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" we get ""blue blue blue.""
- ""wif"" alone is not demonstrated, but when it precedes ""walm,"" the result is ""red red red,"" so it implies ""wif"" might relate to ""red.""
- ""dax"" alone is not shown, but when preceding ""walm,"" the result is ""green green green,"" suggesting ""dax"" is related to ""green.""
- ""zup"" on its own is not shown, but based on its appearance in the sequence with ""walm,"" which is ""yellow red green green green blue,"" and considering the patterns seen with other words, ""zup"" likely relates to ""yellow.""

Given this consistent pattern where ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word three times, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,83,walm
"walm -> repetition of the color associated with the previous word. Rule: If a color is associated with a word immediately before ""walm,"" ""walm"" causes that color to be repeated as many times as specified by the number of letters in the word preceding ""walm.""",1.0,83,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that:

- Whenever ""lug"" appears by itself or in a sequence with other words, the output is consistently ""blue.""
- ""lug"" does not seem to modify or affect the surrounding words, given that their corresponding colors do not change regardless of the position of ""lug"" in the sequence.

Even in the last example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm,"" where ""walm"" is likely the nonce word for ""yellow yellow,"" the appearance of ""lug"" generates ""blue,"" consistent with other examples.

Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""",1.0,84,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word 'lug' consistently corresponds to the color blue in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,84,lug

"lug -> blue

Rule: Each instance of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position or the context in which it appears.",1.0,84,lug
"Based on the given examples, dax consistently translates to the color green in the output. Each instance of dax corresponds to the word ""green,"" regardless of the context or position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,84,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that when the nonce word ""dax"" is mentioned in an input, the output consistently contains the color ""green.""

Here are the observations:

- Every instance of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the output.
- Independent of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence, ""green"" is the consistent output.

Therefore, we can state that the meaning of ""dax"" is the color green.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,84,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,84,dax

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" the relationship between the input and the output in the given examples must be analyzed. Each example shows a series of input words corresponding to a series of colored output words.

Here are the observations:

- Whenever the word ""bluf"" is present, the word that immediately follows ""bluf"" is always translated into the same color in the output. For example, in ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup,"" the words after ""bluf"" are ""dax,"" and the corresponding color is ""blue."" In ""lug bluf,"" the word after ""bluf"" is ""lug"" and the color is ""blue."" 

- The word ""bluf"" itself also translates to ""blue"" as seen in ""lug bluf"" translating to ""blue blue.""

Using these observations, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue,"" and it also causes the following word to translate to the color ""blue.""

Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" can be stated as:

bluf -> ""blue"" and the next word is also ""blue"" (with the context of the task given). 

This seems to be a consistent rule across all provided examples.",1.0,84,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" translates into a color, which is consistent with the following pattern in the outputs. Here is what we can deduce:

2. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"", the output is blue.
3. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"", the output is red.
4. When ""bluf"" stands alone, it retains the color associated with the preceding word.
5. The word following ""bluf"" does not appear to affect its color; rather, it seems that ""bluf"" simply mimics the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Therefore, bluf -> the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. If there is no word before it, ""bluf"" appears to retain the color precedent established by its previous usage in the sequence.

"Analyzing the examples given, it appears that the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs. This can be ascertained by checking each instance where ""bluf"" is mentioned:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" and in the output, it turns into ""blue blue green"" respectively. Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the latter two examples and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the second example, we can deduce that each occurrence of ""bluf"" must correspond to ""red.""

- In the second example, ""lug"" and ""bluf"" result in ""blue blue,"" which supports the earlier inference that ""bluf"" is ""red,"" given that ""lug"" has already been established as ""blue.""

- The third example confirms that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" as indicated in the last two examples where ""bluf"" also appears.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the given examples. 

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"". ""Dax"" appears to map to ""green,"" but we don't yet know what ""walm"" contributes since it has the same output as ""dax.""
- In the second example, ""dax walm zup lug dax"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue green."" The first ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" and the second ""dax"" at the end also maps to ""green."" ""Zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" maps to ""blue."" Since ""walm"" is again followed by ""green,"" it suggests ""walm"" might cause the word it follows (""dax"" in this case) to repeat its output, ""green green green.""
- In the third example, ""lug zup dax walm"" translates to ""blue yellow green green green."" The pattern is ""lug"" -> ""blue,"" ""zup"" -> ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" -> ""green."" ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and once again results in a repetition of ""green,"" further supporting the idea that ""walm"" causes a repetition.
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" translates to ""red red green green red red red blue red."" Again, ""walm"" follows a color (""red"") and causes a repetition of that color.
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red."" ""Lug"" maps to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated. ""Wif"" then maps to ""red.""

Based on the above analysis, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color output of the word that precedes it.

Rule: walm -> causes the color output of the previous word to repeat.",1.0,84,walm
"Given the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word 'walm' causes the next word to repeat the color output of the last word mentioned before 'walm'. Below, I am going to explain how I came to this conclusion.

Let's break down each example:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
Explanation: The color green is repeated following 'dax', which precedes 'walm'.

2. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
Explanation: The color green is repeated after 'dax', which comes before 'walm'. The colors for the rest (yellow for 'zup', blue for 'lug', and green for 'dax') are not affected by 'walm', only the one immediately following it.

3. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
Explanation: The sequence follows the established color pattern until 'walm', which causes 'green' to repeat since 'dax' (which translates to green) precedes 'walm'.

4. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
Explanation: Each word follows its respective color until 'walm', after which 'blue' (color for 'lug') is repeated, suggesting that 'walm' caused the preceding word's color (red for 'wif') to repeat. 'Lug' breaks the pattern following 'walm' and 'wif' continues with its predetermined color.

5. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
Explanation: The color blue is repeated for both 'lug' and the instance after 'walm', followed by the red color for 'wif'. 

Rule:
walm -> causes the next word to repeat the color of the preceding word.",0.8,84,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we must look for patterns within the given examples.

In the first example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" Since ""dax"" outputs to ""green,"" we can infer that ""walm"" might also mean ""green.""

In the second example, ""dax walm zup lug dax"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue green."" Based on this, ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and ""zup"" means ""yellow."" Due to the repetition of ""dax"" at the end and it translating to ""green"" again, we still associate ""walm"" with ""green.""

In the third example, ""lug zup dax walm"" translates to ""blue yellow green green green."" This maintains our assumption that ""walm"" translates to ""green,"" as ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax"" have the same translations as in the second example.

In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" translates to ""red red green green red red red blue red."" Based on the translations of the other words, ""wif"" means ""red,"" ""bluf"" means ""red,"" ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and ""dax"" means ""green"" again. The word ""walm"" thus seems to precede a ""blue""—the translation for ""lug""—but given all previous contexts where ""walm"" has always translated to ""green,"" and ""walm"" comes after ""red red green green red red red"" in this example, it doesn't break the established pattern.

In the fifth example, ""lug walm wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red."" ""Lug"" is translated to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The word ""walm"" in this context translates to ""blue,"" which initially seems to break the previously established pattern.

However, if we assume that ""walm"" takes on the color preceding it, we can see that it makes sense in all cases. ""Dax"" is green, and when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green. In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows a string of words that have red outputs, but the persistent pattern suggests that ""walm"" should still transform to green. This is somewhat confusing, but if ""walm"" appeared after ""bluf,"" which is ""red,"" it could take the color of ""green"" as green consistently follow ""bluf"" in other examples. In the final example, ""walm"" takes on the blue from ""lug,"" which fits the rule.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is that it takes on the color of the word preceding it or maintains the color green that follows ""dax"" or ""bluf,"" which is also ""green.""

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word or maintains the color green following ""dax"" or ""bluf.""",0.8,84,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to cause the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word. To confirm this, let's examine the examples:

1. ""dax walm"" yields ""green green green."" Since ""dax"" is associated with green, ""walm"" also produces green.

2. ""dax walm zup lug dax"" yields ""green green green yellow blue green."" After ""dax,"" ""walm"" results in ""green"" again, and the subsequent words have their associated colors.

3. ""lug zup dax walm"" yields ""blue yellow green green green."" After ""dax,"" ""walm"" results in ""green"" repeating.

4. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" yields ""red red green green red red red blue red."" ""Walm"" follows ""wif,"" which has the associated color red, and the output is ""red"" for ""walm.""

5. ""lug walm wif"" yields ""blue blue blue red."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is associated with blue, resulting in another blue.

"Rule: Each instance of the nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""",1.0,85,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can infer that ""dax"" relates to a specific color in the output. To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's compare the outputs whenever ""dax"" appears in the input:

1. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow

2. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue

3. Input: dax zup lug bluf
   Output: green yellow blue blue

4. Input: lug zup dax wif
   Output: blue yellow green red

5. Input: lug zup dax lug dax
   Output: blue yellow green blue green

By comparing the examples, we notice that:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears at the beginning of an input string, the first color in the output is green.
- If ""dax"" is not the first word, it follows the color of the word before it in the output.
- ""dax"" itself does not seem to have a consistent corresponding color when appearing in different positions.

Therefore, it seems that ""dax"" acts as a kind of function word or modifier that changes the output color based on its position in the input string. The rule could be:

When ""dax"" is the first word in the input, it maps to ""green"". When ""dax"" follows another word, it takes the color of the preceding word in the output.

Rule: dax -> When first, green; otherwise, it takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,85,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Here is the rule deduced from the examples:

"Analyzing the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the same position in the output.
2. Other words seem to correspond to different colors irrespective of their position. For example, ""lug"" always translates to ""blue"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""walm"" to ""green"".

Based on these observations, the rule for ""dax"" can be deduced:

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" correlates to the color ""green"". So, dax -> green.",1.0,85,dax
"From the given examples, we can observe patterns to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"". Here are the observations:

1. Input: ""dax wif walm lug zup"" Output: ""green red red red blue yellow""
   - Here, the word ""dax"" is followed by an output of ""green"".

2. Input: ""dax walm zup lug"" Output: ""green green green yellow blue""
   - Again, the word ""dax"" results in ""green"".

3. Input: ""dax zup lug bluf"" Output: ""green yellow blue blue""
   - The word ""dax"" is followed by ""green"".

4. Input: ""lug zup dax wif"" Output: ""blue yellow green red""
   - The word ""dax"" appears after ""lug"" and ""zup"" and results in ""green"".

5. Input: ""lug zup dax lug dax"" Output: ""blue yellow green blue green""
   - The word ""dax"" is used twice and both times it corresponds to ""green"".

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"", regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the deduction is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,85,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can observe a pattern in the use of ""wif"" and its corresponding output. In each instance, ""wif"" seems to be associated with the color red. It seems consistent that ""wif"" is followed by the word ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. 

Additionally, other words seem to correspond with other colors in a one-to-one manner, meaning each of these nonce words likely represents a specific color. ""Bluf"" consistently leads to the output ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to a repetition of ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Given these observations, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,85,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,85,wif
"From observing the patterns in the examples, we can infer the following:

1. The word ""wif"" always results in the output ""red.""
2. The word ""wif"" produces ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red. The meaning of ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""",1.0,85,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""wif"" by examining each instance of its use and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: ""wif bluf"" -> Output: ""red red""
2. Input: ""wif dax lug walm"" -> Output: ""red green blue blue blue""
3. Input: ""dax lug wif bluf"" -> Output: ""green blue red red""
4. Input: ""lug wif zup wif walm"" -> Output: ""blue red yellow red red red""
5. Input: ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> Output: ""red red green green green""

From the examples, we can observe:

- The word ""wif"" always results in ""red"" in the output.
- When ""wif"" is followed by another word (e.g., ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" ""zup""), the next word in the input results in a color output that repeats a number of times: ""bluf"" repeats twice, ""dax"" repeats once, ""lug"" repeats one less time than the number of letters in ""lug"" (i.e., three letters in ""lug,"" but only two ""blue""s in the output), ""walm"" repeats three times, ""zup"" repeats twice.
- If ""wif"" follows another word, it renders an additional repetition of ""red"" for the output color associated with ""wif."" This can be seen most clearly in example 4, where ""zup wif"" results in ""yellow red,"" and ""wif walm"" afterward results in ""red red red red.""
- Additionally, the word that directly follows ""wif"" seems to determine the number of times the next respective color is repeated.

Given these observations, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and causes the next color word to repeat based on some rule related to the length of the word that follows ""wif"" or its position in the sequence. With the provided examples, there is still some ambiguity about the exact repetition rule. However, for the task at hand, we can define:

wif -> ""red,"" and it affects the repetition of the subsequent color word.",1.0,85,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

The presence of the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output. Each occurrence of ""wif"" also leads to an additional ""red"" for other non-""wif"" words following it in the sequence until the next ""wif"" appears.",1.0,85,wif
"Rule: zup switches the output color sequence to the next color in a preset order (green, red, blue, yellow) every time it appears. If a color sequence is active, it repeats the current color until zup changes it.

According to the examples, the sequence appears to start with ""green"" and zup acts as a trigger to switch to the next color in the given order:

- In the first input, ""walm"" is consistently associated with the output ""green."" After the first appearance of ""zup,"" ""walm"" is then associated with ""yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" triggers a change to the next color, which is ""yellow.""
- In the second input, ""zup"" at the beginning and at the end maintains the output ""yellow,"" with the only exception being ""bluf lug,"" which maps to ""blue."" This suggests that ""zup"" reset the color to ""yellow.""
- In the third input, ""dax"" consistently leads to ""green,"" and ""zup"" leads to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth and fifth input examples, ""zup"" appears in the middle and switches the output color to the next one in order, maintaining that color until another ""zup"" occurs or the sequence ends.

So, the rule summarized:

zup -> Triggers a change to the next color in the sequence green -> red -> blue -> yellow -> (and then loops back to green if another zup is present).",1.0,85,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we'll look at its occurrences and the output colors associated with them. We can see a pattern between the inputs and the outputs:

- When ""zup"" is at the end of a sequence, it seems to be indicated by the color ""yellow."" For instance, in the first example, after ""walm zup,"" the output is ""red red red yellow,"" matching the three ""walm"" with the ""red"" color and the ""zup"" with ""yellow.""

- In the second example, ""zup"" occurs both at the beginning and near the end before ""lug zup."" The output colors are ""yellow yellow blue yellow."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" it is reasonable to deduce that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in both its positions.

- In the third example, the sequence ""zup dax"" corresponds to the output ""yellow green,"" which again supports the idea that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

- In the fourth example, ""zup"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by a sequence of colors starting with ""yellow."" The pattern holds, with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow.""

- In the fifth example, ""zup"" is followed by ""wif lug walm,"" and the output sequence after ""zup"" is ""yellow red blue blue blue,"" again maintaining the pattern that ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow.""

Considering these observations, we can deduce a rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in an input sequence, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output sequence.",1.0,85,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" results in a pattern of repetition based on the last color before ""zup"" is mentioned. Here's the observed logic:

- In the first example, ""walm"" precedes ""zup"" and ""walm"" correlates to ""red."" After ""zup,"" the color ""red"" repeats three times.
- In the second example, ""lug"" comes before ""zup"" and ""lug"" is associated with ""blue."" Following ""zup,"" the color ""blue"" does not repeat, indicating that ""zup"" itself corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" comes before ""zup"" and ""dax"" correlates to ""green."" After ""zup,"" there are no more colors, suggesting that ""zup"" once again translates to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" precedes ""zup"" and is correlated with the color ""blue."" After ""zup,"" the sequence ""yellow yellow"" appears before repeating another ""lug,"" which then correlates to ""blue"" again.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" is before ""zup"" and correlates to ""green."" After ""zup,"" we see ""yellow"" followed by further colors unrelated to ""green.""

From these observations, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" correlates to the color ""yellow."" When ""zup"" appears in the sequence, the previous color is not repeated immediately after. Instead, the output is ""yellow"" following ""zup"" regardless of the previous color. Therefore, we can induce:

zup → yellow

Rule: When ""zup"" is in the input, the output is ""yellow.""",1.0,85,zup
"Based on the given examples, it looks like zup changes the color associated with the next word or sequence of words. Specifically, it seems to change the color to yellow. Here is how:

In the first example, ""dax walm wif"" are associated with the color green, red, red respectively, but once the word ""zup"" appears, the following ""walm"" which was previously red is now followed by yellow.

In the second example, ""bluf lug"" are blue, blue, but when ""zup"" precedes them, they output yellow instead of their assigned color.

In the third example, ""zup"" immediately followed by ""dax"" just outputs yellow green, where ""dax"" is associated with green on its own.

In the fourth example, ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" becomes red blue yellow yellow yellow carrying the pattern, where the word following ""zup"" turns to yellow, and as ""wif"" and ""lug"" repeat after ""zup"", they also turn yellow instead of their usual red and blue.

In the fifth example, after ""zup"" appears, the sequence ""wif lug walm"" which would normally be red blue blue, all turn into yellow.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""zup"" changes the color of the words that follow it to yellow, until a different non-yellow color appears.

Rule: zup -> changes the following words' colors to yellow until a different color is denoted.",0.9,85,zup
"Based on the given examples, we need to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""zup."" 

1. In the first example, the word ""zup"" is preceded by ""walm"" twice and followed by no other words, resulting in ""red red red yellow.""
2. In the second example, ""zup"" occurs at the beginning and in the middle of the sequence, surrounded by words that are not repeated, and the result is ""yellow yellow"" at the beginning and ""yellow"" where ""zup"" is in the middle.
3. In the third example, ""zup"" follows ""dax"" and the result is ""yellow green,"" with ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup.""
4. In the fourth example, the sequence ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" results in ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue."" The word ""zup"" occurs after a pair of ""wif lug,"" and all three of these words turn into ""yellow.""
5. In the fifth example, ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" turns into ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue."" Here, the ""zup"" is followed by a sequence of ""wif lug walm,"" and all three turn into ""yellow.""

From the above observations, the rule for ""zup"" seems to relate to changing the repeated words to yellow. It seems to reset the color sequence to yellow at its position and affects subsequent repeated words until there's a change.

However, there is an inconsistency in this pattern because not all repeated words after ""zup"" turn into yellow in the given examples. For instance, in the last example, the word ""walm"" after ""zup"" turns into blue instead of continuing the pattern to be yellow.

Accordingly, the rule for ""zup"" is not entirely clear. From the examples, though, we can see that ""zup"" itself corresponds to ""yellow,"" but its effect on the surrounding words is not consistent and needs more examples to accurately deduce its rule.

- If a different color word appears immediately after a sequence of ""lug,"" then that color word's color is outputted next, ending the repetition.",1.0,85,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. For example:

- In ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to the color yellow, so ""walm"" results in repeating the color yellow.

- In ""dax walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to green, so ""walm"" results in repetition of the color green.

- In ""dax walm wif lug dax walm,"" the first ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), resulting in repeated greens, and then the second ""walm"" again follows ""dax"" (green), resulting in repeated greens once more.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" can be summarized as:

walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.

Rule: If a word ""X"" is followed by the word ""walm"", the output will be the color associated with ""X"" repeated for each occurrence of ""walm"" following ""X"".",1.0,85,walm
"Based on the provided examples, walm appears to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Each nonce word (lug, zup, dax, and wif) corresponds to a color (blue, yellow, green, and red, respectively). When the word ""walm"" follows one of these nonce words, the output is a repetition of the color that the preceding nonce word translates to, and the repetition continues until a new color word is introduced.

Here are the rules observed for each input and output pair:

- In ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"", ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"" until ""lug"" (blue) appears again.
- In ""lug zup walm lug"", ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"" until ""lug"" (blue) appears.
- In ""dax walm"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and the output is ""green green green"".
- In ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"", ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and the output is ""blue blue"" until ""zup"" (yellow) appears, interrupting the pattern.
- In ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) first, producing ""green green green"", then later ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) again, producing another ""green green green"".

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word until a new color word appears.",1.0,85,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color word that precedes it, one more time than the number of times the preceding color word appears. For example:

- In the first example ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" the word ""lug"" (blue) precedes ""walm"" and appears two times before ""walm."" Therefore, ""walm"" results in two additional ""blue"" outputs.

- In the second example ""lug zup walm lug,"" the word ""zup"" (yellow) precedes ""walm"" and appears once before ""walm."" Therefore, ""walm"" results in one additional ""yellow"" output.

- In the third example ""dax walm,"" the word ""dax"" (green) precedes ""walm"" and appears once before ""walm."" Therefore, ""walm"" results in two additional ""green"" outputs, since there is no ""green"" following ""walm"".

- In the fourth example ""zup dax lug walm zup lug,"" the word ""lug"" (blue) precedes ""walm"" and appears once before ""walm."" Therefore, ""walm"" results in one additional ""blue"" output.

- In the fifth example ""dax walm wif lug dax walm,"" the first ""dax"" (green) that precedes the first ""walm"" appears once before it, resulting in one additional ""green"" output, then ""lug"" (blue) precedes the second ""walm"" appearing once before it, resulting again in one additional ""blue"" output after ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be:
Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color word that precedes ""walm"" by the number of times it has already appeared before ""walm"" plus one (if possible). If the color word does not repeat after ""walm"", then it repeats for as many times as it appeared before ""walm"".",0.9,85,walm
"Observing the patterns in the examples provided, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"". Every time ""lug"" is presented in the input, ""blue"" is included in the corresponding output. No other dependencies, such as position or surrounding words, seem to affect this translation.

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,86,lug
"Given the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" Each time the word ""lug"" is used in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output. Here is the observed correlation:

- Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue (lug corresponds to blue)
- Input: lug zup wif -> Output: blue yellow red (lug corresponds to blue)
- Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue (lug corresponds to blue)
- Input: zup lug -> Output: yellow blue (lug corresponds to blue)
- Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> Output: blue green green yellow blue red (lug corresponds to blue again)

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,86,lug
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" let's look at the examples provided and the corresponding outputs:

1. ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
2. ""lug zup wif"" -> ""blue yellow red""
3. ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" -> ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue""
4. ""zup lug"" -> ""yellow blue""
5. ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" -> ""blue green green yellow blue red""

From these examples, it seems that ""lug"" is consistently translated as ""blue"" in the output:

- In example 1, ""lug"" comes after ""wif"" and results in ""blue"" coming after ""red"".
- In example 2, ""lug"" precedes ""zup wif"" and leads to ""blue"" preceding ""yellow red"".
- In example 3, ""lug"" appears twice, once after ""wif"" and once preceding ""walm"", resulting in ""blue"" appearing once after ""red"" and once before ""blue blue"".
- In example 4, ""lug"" comes after ""zup"", resulting in ""blue"" appearing after ""yellow"".
- In example 5, ""lug"" appears twice, once before ""dax"" and once before ""wif"", resulting in ""blue"" before ""green"" and then ""blue"" before ""red"".

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"". 

lug -> blue.",1.0,86,lug
"Analyzing the given examples where the nonce word ""lug"" occurs and the accompanying outputs, let's observe the correlation:

1. Input: wif lug | Output: red blue

3. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm | Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
4. Input: zup lug | Output: yellow blue
5. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif | Output: blue green green yellow blue red

A review of the inputs and outputs shows that every occurrence of ""lug"" directly corresponds to the output ""blue"". This connection is consistent in all the provided examples. Therefore, the rule that can be induced is:

Rule: ""lug"" -> blue",1.0,86,lug
"Rule: lug -> blue

"Based on the examples provided where the word ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color in the output, the meaning of ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

Input: wif lug dax -> Output: red blue green
Input: dax lug wif -> Output: green blue red
Input: wif zup dax -> Output: red yellow green
Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow
Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red

From these examples, every time ""wif"" appears, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, the rule can be interpreted as:

wif -> red.",1.0,86,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the given examples.",1.0,86,wif
"Based on the examples provided:

- Whenever ""wif"" is present, regardless of its position, the output always includes ""red.""
- The word ""wif"" does not seem to affect the other words and their corresponding outputs, such as ""lug"" always correlating to ""blue"" and ""dax"" always correlating to ""green.""
- The relative position of other words (e.g., ""zup"" and ""dax"") does affect their output order, but ""wif"" consistently results in ""red"" without affecting the sequence of output for other words.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the given examples.",1.0,86,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Consequently, the rule seems to be straightforward and not dependent on context or neighboring words. Therefore:

zup -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: zup translates to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,86,zup
"Based on the given context, ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" each time it is used. Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" can be written as:

zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,86,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,86,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following associations for each word:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"".
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"".
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
- ""bluf"" has no direct translation, but it may not need one for the purpose of this task.

Given that ""zup"" appears consistently before ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the word that precedes or follows it, we can infer that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

zup -> yellow.",1.0,86,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position within the input sequence.",1.0,86,zup
"Reviewing the given examples:

1. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: zup wif bluf

   Output: blue red green green red blue

4. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

5. Input: wif bluf dax lug
   Output: red red green blue

From these examples, we can infer that the word bluf causes the output to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it. Therefore:

- When ""bluf"" followed ""zup"", the output was ""yellow"" twice, since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- When ""bluf"" followed ""wif"", the output was ""red"" twice, since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- When ""bluf"" followed ""lug"", the output was ""blue"" twice, since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- When ""bluf"" followed ""dax"", the output was ""green"" twice, since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it.",1.0,86,bluf
"Given the examples provided, we can observe that each instance of ""bluf"" in the input correlates to an instance of ""green"" in the output, with the difference that the repeated color prior to ""bluf"" is always printed twice consecutively.

Let's examine each example:

1. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm - Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
Here, the color ""yellow"" is associated with ""zup."" The term ""lug"" leads to the color ""blue,"" and right after ""bluf,"" we see ""blue"" appearing.

2. Input: zup wif bluf - Output: yellow red red
""Zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" We notice again that after ""bluf,"" ""red"" is repeated.

3. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug - Output: blue red green green red blue
""Bluf"" appears after ""dax,"" which correlates with ""green,"" and as expected ""green"" appears twice.

4. Input: dax bluf - Output: green green
""Dax"" leads to ""green,"" and following ""bluf"" is ""green green.""

5. Input: wif bluf dax lug - Output: red red green blue
Again, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and ""red"" is doubled.

Given this pattern, we can deduce that ""bluf"" indicates a repetition of the color word that would typically follow it. However, there's an additional regularity that whichever color word comes before ""bluf"" is the one that's repeated twice.

Rule: bluf -> Causes the color that would come next to be repeated twice, by repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""",1.0,86,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" has its output linked to the color immediately preceding it. We can deduce that ""bluf"" takes on the color that comes before it in the sequence. Here's a breakdown of each example:

- In the first example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" means blue because ""lug"" also means blue.
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" means red because ""wif"" also means red.
- In the third example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" means green because ""dax"" also means green.
- The fourth example is slightly repetitive since it's the same as the third, reinforcing the same rule.
- In the last example, ""wif bluf dax lug"" translates to ""red red green blue,"" where ""wif bluf"" is ""red red,"" again showing that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.",1.0,86,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the word ""bluf"" seems to correlate with the color that the previous word represents. When ""bluf"" appears after a word, the output is the color of the previous word followed by ""green."" Here are the rules based on the given inputs and outputs:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which correlates with the color ""yellow,"" the output is ""yellow green.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which correlates with the color ""red,"" the output is ""red green.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which correlates with the color ""blue,"" the output is ""blue green.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which correlates with the color ""green,"" the output is ""green green.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" after a word translates to the color of that word followed by the color ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> The color of the preceding word followed by green.",1.0,86,bluf
Rule: bluf -> the color that is spoken immediately before it.,0.0,86,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the pattern of color word outputs in relation to the input words. Observing the color associations with other words can help us identify the pattern relevant to ""walm.""

Here are the associations we can derive from the examples:

- ""lug"" seems to be associated with ""blue.""
- ""wif"" seems to be associated with ""red.""
- ""zup"" seems to be associated with ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" seems to be associated with ""green.""
- ""bluf"" might be a typo for ""blue"" or another color starting with ""bl"" ('red' repeats after it).

In each instance where ""walm"" appears, the color ""red"" occurs repeatedly after the initial color associated with the word just before ""walm.""

Now let's test this with the given examples:

1. lug wif walm
   - lug -> blue
   - wif -> red
   - walm following wif results in a repetition of ""red,"" so the output is blue red red red

2. wif walm zup
   - wif -> red
   - walm following wif results in a repetition of ""red,"" so the output starts with red red red
   - zup -> yellow

3. zup walm lug wif bluf
   - zup -> yellow
   - walm following zup results in a repetition of ""yellow,"" so the output starts with yellow yellow yellow
   - lug -> blue
   - wif -> red
   - bluf -> likely red given the pattern

4. lug walm
   - lug -> blue
   - walm following lug results in a repetition of ""blue,"" so the output is blue blue blue

5. lug zup dax walm
   - lug -> blue
   - zup -> yellow
   - dax -> green
   - walm following dax results in a repetition of ""green,"" so the output finishes with green green green

Seeing this pattern, it can be deduced that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word (if any) to be repeated in the output sequence until a new color word is introduced or the sequence ends.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word in the output sequence. If there is no preceding color word before ""walm,"" the rule may either not apply or follow a default color of ""red."" However, we don't have an example that tests the latter case completely.

Rule: Repeat the preceding color in the output.",1.0,86,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" influences the color in the output by repeating it three times. Specifically, the color that corresponds to the word immediately before ""walm"" is the one that is repeated. 

Looking at each example:

1. In ""lug wif walm,"" ""wif"" correlates to red, and the output is ""blue red red red"". Thus, after the blue that corresponds to ""lug,"" the next color repeats three times.
2. In ""wif walm zup,"" ""wif"" again relates to red, and the output is ""red red red yellow,"" so ""red"" is repeated thrice before moving on to the next color.
3. In ""zup walm lug wif bluf,"" ""zup"" correlates to yellow, resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow"" followed by the subsequent colors for ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""bluf.""
4. In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" stands for blue, with the output being ""blue blue blue,"" repeating ""blue"" three times.
5. In ""lug zup dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, and following this pattern, the color green is repeated thrice in ""green green green."" 

Hence, the underlying rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat three times in the output sequence.

Rule: walm -> makes the associated color of the preceding word repeat three times in the output.",1.0,86,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we'll analyze the patterns of the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. lug wif walm
   blue red red red

2. wif walm zup
   red red red yellow

3. zup walm lug wif bluf
   yellow yellow yellow blue red red

4. lug walm
   blue blue blue

5. lug zup dax walm
   blue yellow green green green

Looking at the examples, we can identify the following patterns:

- Each time the word ""walm"" is used, the output consists of multiple (more than one) instances of the same color.
- The color in the output corresponds to the color of the word that appears just before ""walm"" in the input.
- The number of times the color is repeated in the output after ""walm"" appears seems to always be three, regardless of what other words are in the input.

Based on these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates that the color associated with the previous word should be repeated three times in the output.

Applying this rule, we get:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times in the output.",1.0,86,walm
"Based on the input-output patterns provided, it seems the word walm corresponds to repeating the color associated with the immediately preceding word in the output. Here's the rule observed:

- lug is associated with blue. When ""lug walm"" is observed, we get ""blue blue blue"", indicating the repetition of the associated color blue.
- wif is associated with red. When ""wif walm"" is observed, we get ""red red red"", again showing the repetition of red.
- zup is associated with yellow. When ""zup walm"" is present, we find ""yellow yellow yellow"", following the same pattern.
- When ""dax walm"" is observed, the output is ""green green green"", which suggests dax is associated with green and walm repeats it.

Therefore, the meaning of walm is that it repeats the color associated with the previous word in the sequence the same number of times as the number of letters in the word preceding walm.

Here is the rule deduced:

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color associated with the previous word the same number of times as the number of letters in the word.",1.0,86,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm"", let's look at the pattern of colors in the output associated with each input that contains the word ""walm"". 

1. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (input: ""lug wif walm""), the color blue (associated with ""lug"") is repeated thrice in the output (""blue red red red"").
2. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (input: ""wif walm zup""), the color red (associated with ""wif"") is repeated thrice in the output (""red red red yellow"").
3. When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (input: ""zup walm lug wif bluf""), the color yellow (associated with ""zup"") is repeated thrice in the output (""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"").
4. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" without another element (input: ""lug walm""), blue is repeated thrice in the output (""blue blue blue"").
5. When ""walm"" is at the end after ""dax"" (input: ""lug zup dax walm""), the color green (associated with ""dax"") is repeated thrice in the output (""blue yellow green green green"").

From these observations, we can infer the following rule:

"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""dax"" using the clues from the input-output pairs.

1. ""dax lug wif lug"" translates to ""green blue red blue"". Here, ""lug"" appears twice and corresponds to ""blue"" each time, while ""wif"" corresponds with ""red.""

2. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" translates to ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" seems to correspond to multiple instances of ""red"" after ""wif"" and multiple instances of ""yellow"" after ""zup."" ""walm"" after ""dax"" resulted in three ""green,"" which matches the rule that appears to be the emerging pattern for the number of colors that ""walm"" outputs depends on the word preceding it.

3. ""zup dax"" translates to ""yellow green"". Here, ""zup"" precedes ""dax"" and corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"". Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" which results in three ""green.""

5. ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green"". Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" after ""wif"" creates two additional ""red,"" and ""dax"" at the end translates to ""green.""

Considering these examples, a pattern emerges where ""dax"" always translates to ""green."" In cases where ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the number of times ""green"" is outputted matches the number of words until the next non-""walm"" word or the end of the sequence.

Rule: ""dax"" -> ""green""",1.0,87,dax
"Rule: dax -> green followed by repeating the color associated with the next word in the input sequence. 

Examining the provided examples:

1. dax lug wif lug translates to green blue red blue, where dax is green, and lug is blue, so following dax, lug (blue) is repeated; wif is red and the sequence finishes with another lug, which is blue.

2. dax wif walm lug zup walm translates to green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow, where dax is followed by three wif (red), one lug (blue), and three walm (yellow). The repetition of the colors follows each word after dax.

3. zup dax translates to yellow green, with zup being yellow and followed by dax, which is green without any following word, hence no color to repeat.

4. dax walm translates to green green green, where dax is green followed by repeating walm's associated color, which is also green.

5. wif walm dax translates to red red red green, where wif and walm are red, followed by dax, which is green.

To summarize, whenever dax appears, it signals green followed by the color associated with the subsequent word in the pattern. If there is no subsequent word, only green is produced.",1.0,87,dax
"Rule: dax -> green, repeated as many times as the word that follows it has letters.

Explanation: 

- In the first example, the word following ""dax"" is ""lug,"" which has three letters, and the output is ""green blue red blue"". Therefore, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is repeated three times to match the three letters in ""lug"".

- In the second example, ""dax"" is followed by ""wif walm lug zup walm."" ""Wif"" has three letters, so ""green"" appears three times. ""Walm"" has four letters, and ""green"" does not appear since it's not immediately after ""dax"". ""Lug"" has three letters, and ""zup"" has three letters; however, since ""dax"" isn't directly before ""lug"" or ""zup"", there is no repetition of ""green"" for these words.

- The third example, ""zup dax,"" has ""dax"" which is outputting ""green,"" but since no word follows, there's no repetition, so it's just ""yellow green"".

- In the fourth example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" which has four letters, and the output is ""green green green green"" - 'dax' becomes four greens here.

- The fifth example, ""wif walm dax,"" ends with ""dax,"" which outputs ""green,"" but there are no words after ""dax"" for additional repetition, reflecting the earlier rule that 'dax' repeats as many times as the next word would allow.

Based on the patterns in the provided examples, ""dax"" converts to ""green,"" which repeats as many times as the number of letters in the word that immediately follows it. If ""dax"" is the last word or does not have an associated following word (which isn't represented in the examples provided but can be inferred), it translates to a single ""green.""",1.0,87,dax
"dax -> green.

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,87,dax
"Based on the examples given, we can infer the following:

1. ""dax"" precedes a color word, influencing the number of times that color word is repeated.
2. The examples show that ""lug"" is translated to ""blue"" without any repetition, ""wif"" is translated to ""red"" without any repetition, ""walm"" is translated to ""red"" and is repeated three times, and ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"" without repetition.
3. However, anytime ""dax"" comes before these words, the resulting color is ""green"" and seems to determine the number of times the ""green"" is outputted. For ""wif"" and ""lug,"" ""green"" is said only once. For ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times, paralleling the repetition of ""red"" for ""walm"" without ""dax.""

From the examples, we can induce the following rule for what ""dax"" means when it comes before another word:

Rule: 
- ""dax"" -> ""green,"" with the number of times ""green"" is repeated depending on the word that follows ""dax.""
- If ""dax"" precedes ""wif"" or ""lug"" (which have no repetition as standalone colors), then ""green"" will be mentioned only once.
- If ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" (which has a threefold repetition of its associated color ""red""), then ""green"" will be repeated three times.

Thus, the rule for ""dax"" could be stated as: ""Replace the following word's color with 'green' and maintain the repetition count of the color for that word.""",0.8,87,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif"" from the examples, let's first list them out and look for a pattern.

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   
2. Input: zup dax wif
   Output: yellow green red

3. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red

4. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

5. Input: wif dax
   Output: red green

Now, let's examine the position and occurrence of ""wif"" and how it correlates with the output:

In examples 1, 4, and 5, ""wif"" appears before or after another word, and the corresponding output includes ""red"" either before or after another color. This suggests that ""wif"" could map to the color ""red.""

- Example 1 starts with ""zup wif"" and the output starts with ""yellow red."" Since ""zup"" precedes ""wif"" and ""yellow"" precedes ""red"" in the output, it seems that the word preceding ""wif"" is mapped to the color preceding ""red.""

- Example 2 has ""wif"" at the end, and the output has ""red"" at the end. The word ""dax"" precedes ""wif"" and in the output, ""green"" precedes ""red."" This appears consistent with the other examples. 

- Example 3 consists of only ""dax wif,"" and the output is just ""green red,"" indicating a direct mapping between the two words and colors; ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

- Example 4 is the longest sequence, but again, ""wif"" is at the end, and ""red"" matches its position in the output sequence. The other words have their corresponding colors, and ""wif"" retains its mapping to ""red."" 

- Example 5 has ""wif"" at the beginning and ""red"" at the beginning of the output, confirming the consistency of its mapping.

Given the pattern in these examples, the rule appears to be consistent:

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,87,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that each English word correlates with a specific color:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- walm -> red

When the word ""wif"" appears, ""red"" is always included in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,87,wif
"Based on the provided input-output pairs, we can determine that the word 'wif' does not correspond to a consistent color output. However, in every instance where 'wif' is used, the output sequence contains the color 'red.' Additionally, the word 'wif' never appears at the beginning of the input unless it's immediately followed by 'dax.'

From the given examples:

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
(Here 'wif' is followed by 'walm' which produces three 'red')

Input: zup dax wif
Output: yellow green red
(Here 'wif' is at the end and follows 'dax', resulting in 'red')

Input: dax wif
Output: green red
(Here 'wif' is at the end and follows 'dax', again resulting in 'red')

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
(Here 'wif' is at the end, after 'zup', giving 'red')

Input: wif dax
Output: red green
('wif' precedes 'dax' here; 'wif' gives 'red' and 'dax' gives 'green')

Given that 'wif' always results in 'red' and does not seem to directly influence the color associated with other words, we could deduce the following rule:

Rule: 'wif' translates to 'red' in the output, and its position in the input does not alter its output.",1.0,87,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can analyze the relationship between the input and the output:

- In every instance where the word 'wif' appears in the input, the color 'red' appears in the output.
- 'wif' does not seem to be dependent on its position in the sequence since it produces 'red' irrespective of whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end of the input sequences.
- The presence of other words ('zup', 'dax', 'lug', 'walm') results in other colors, and these words seem to have their own corresponding color outputs:

  'zup' correlates with 'yellow'
  'dax' correlates with 'green'
  'lug' correlates with 'blue'
  'walm' correlates with 'red' as well, but its behavior might be different since when it appears with 'wif', the output is 'red red'.

From these observations, we can induce that the word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red'. To communicate this following the requested format:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,87,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to look at the provided input and corresponding output to identify patterns. I will analyze each pair of examples given:

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

In this sequence, ""wif"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""walm."" The corresponding colors for ""zup"" and ""walm"" in the output are ""yellow"" and ""red"" respectively. The second ""red"" in the output corresponds to ""wif,"" which suggests ""wif"" may be associated with the color ""red.""

Input: zup dax wif
Output: yellow green red

Here, ""zup"" and ""dax"" lead to the colors ""yellow"" and ""green,"" respectively. The color following ""dax"" is ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif."" This reinforces the idea that ""wif"" might be associated with ""red.""

Input: dax wif
Output: green red

In this example, only ""dax"" and ""wif"" are present, leading to ""green"" followed by ""red."" This suggests that the presence of ""wif"" continues to correlate to the color ""red.""

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

The pattern in this longer input corresponds to the color output as follows: ""dax"" goes with ""green,"" ""lug"" and ""walm"" go with ""blue,"" ""zup"" goes with ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is once again associated with ""red.""

Input: wif dax
Output: red green

The pattern is consistent, where ""wif"" precedes ""dax"" and correlates to the color ""red,"" followed by ""green,"" which corresponds to ""dax.""

Based on these examples, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" is consistently associated with the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input. Thus, the rule can be summarized as:

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,87,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,87,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems clear that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in each instance it is used. Additionally, it does not appear that ""zup"" is context-dependent, as its meaning stays consistent regardless of its place within the input strings. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,87,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can try to infer the meaning of ""zup"" by looking at the consistent patterns associated with its usage.

In the first example, the output translates ""lug zup lug"" to ""blue yellow blue."" In this case, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" while both instances of ""lug"" correspond to ""blue"".

In all the given inputs, it appears that every time ""zup"" is mentioned, the output consistently includes the word ""yellow"". Hence, it's reasonable to assume from the provided examples that ""zup"" is directly equivalent to ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,87,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each given example.",1.0,87,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,87,zup
"Based on the examples provided:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""

When trying to understand what ""bluf"" translates to, looking at changing elements surrounding the appearances of ""bluf"" is key. In each instance where ""bluf"" appears, the color that follows it in the output is directly linked to the word that follows it in the input.

- In ""zup bluf wif walm"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow red"" (considering ""wif"" translates to ""red"").
- In ""lug zup bluf dax"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow green"" (considering ""dax"" translates to ""green"").
- In ""dax lug bluf"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue blue"" (considering ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and there's no other word following it in the sequence).
- In ""wif bluf lug zup"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue yellow"" (considering ""lug"" translates to ""blue"").
- In ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""green blue"" and ""green yellow"" (considering ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and later ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"").

In all these cases, ""bluf"" is followed by the color word which corresponds with the word that comes after ""bluf"" in the input. Therefore, ""bluf"" must be a rule that repeats the color of the word immediately following it in the input sequence.

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color named by the word that comes directly after it in the sequence.",1.0,87,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" represents the color of the following word in the sequence. The examples show that after ""bluf"" is used, the next word is translated to its corresponding color twice.

Here's the breakdown:
- ""bluf wif"" leads to ""red red""
- ""bluf dax"" leads to ""green green""
- ""bluf lug"" leads to ""blue blue""

The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" indicates the next word should be translated to its color, and this color should be output twice.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the next word twice.",1.0,87,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to consistently correspond to the word ""blue"" in the output. Each occurrence of ""bluf"" is translated to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position within the sequence. Hence, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> blue.",1.0,87,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color associated with the word that follows it. In each case, the color that comes after ""bluf"" in the output matches the color normally associated with the next word in the input. To illustrate:

Example 1: ""wif"" follows ""bluf"" and the output is ""red red"", with ""red"" being associated with ""wif"".
Example 2: ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" and the output is ""green"", with ""green"" being associated with ""dax"".
Example 3: No word follows ""bluf,"" however, the pattern from previous examples suggests that ""bluf"" would result in a color that matches the previous word's color. In this case, it's ""lug"" (associated with ""blue"") and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""blue"".
Example 4: ""lug"" follows ""bluf"" and the output for both is ""blue"" which is associated with ""lug"".
Example 5: Repeated instances where ""dax"" and ""zup"" follow ""bluf"" and the outputs match the respective colors for each, ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup"".

Rule: bluf -> The color that corresponds to the following word. If there is no word following ""bluf"", it retains the color associated with the word that precedes it.",1.0,87,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the word ""bluf"" has an effect on the word that immediately follows it. The output color for the word following ""bluf"" is repeated twice. Here are the observations:

1. ""bluf wif"" results in ""red red""
2. ""bluf dax"" results in ""green blue""
3. ""bluf lug"" results in ""blue blue""

For the output of ""bluf dax"" giving ""green blue"", it seems to be an exception or an error based on all the other examples provided which always repeat the same color twice.

By applying this rule to all instances, we see consistency except for the one case:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> The following word's color is repeated twice.

The exception of ""bluf dax"" resulting in ""green blue"" may indicate a mistake in the provided examples or an unknown factor not evident from the examples given. If we ignore this exception, the rule seems to be consistent. Otherwise, additional data would be needed to accurately determine the function of ""bluf"" in the context of ""dax.""",0.8,87,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" correlates with repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm"". Here is the rule as observed from the examples:

- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green""
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red""
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" as in ""lug wif lug walm"", it repeats the color associated with ""lug"" (""blue"") three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,87,walm
"Given the examples provided, each usage of the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. In each instance, when the word ""walm"" appears after another word, the color that corresponds to the preceding word is repeated three times.

Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" When ""walm"" appears after each, the colors repeat three times.
- In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and it's followed by ""walm,"" which repeats the ""yellow"" three times.
- In the third example, ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" is yellow. So, after ""dax walm,"" the color ""green"" is repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is red and directly followed by ""walm,"" resulting in the color ""red"" being repeated three times.
- In the final example, the usage of ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif"" before ""walm"" leads to repetitions of ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""red,"" respectively, each repeated three times according to the placement of ""walm.""

Thus, the rule is:

Rule: ""walm"" indicates that the color associated with the preceding word should be repeated three times.

Written as a rule induction, this would be:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,87,walm
"Based on the supplied examples and their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce a rule for the nonce word ""walm"". Let's analyze each input and its output:

1. Input: `dax zup walm wif walm`
   Output: `green yellow yellow yellow red red red`
   - After ""dax"" (green), ""zup"" (yellow), followed by ""walm"", we see an additional ""yellow"" in the output.
   - After ""wif"" (red), followed by ""walm"", we see additional ""red"" in the output.

2. Input: `zup walm`
   Output: `yellow yellow yellow`
   - After ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of ""yellow"".

3. Input: `lug zup dax walm`
   Output: `blue yellow green green green`
   - ""walm"" after ""dax"" (green) leads to a repetition of ""green"".

4. Input: `wif walm`
   Output: `red red red`
   - After ""wif"" (red), ""walm"" causes repetition of ""red"".

5. Input: `lug wif lug walm zup walm wif`
   Output: `blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red`
   - ""walm"" after ""lug"" (blue) causes repetition of ""blue"".
   - ""walm"" after ""zup"" (yellow) causes repetition of ""yellow"".

From this analysis, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color of the previous word to repeat.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" can be formulated as:

""walm"" -> causes the repetition of the color indicated by the preceding word.",1.0,87,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze each example and the corresponding output patterns.

1. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   Analysis: ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and ""wif,"" each case producing a sequence of three colors. ""Dax"" leads to a single green.

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: ""zup walm"" directly translates to three yellow colors.

3. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   Analysis: ""lug"" produces a blue, ""zup"" a yellow, and ""dax"" a green. However, ""walm"" here results in two extra greens.

4. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   Analysis: Similar to the first example, ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" produces three red colors.

5. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   Analysis: ""lug wif"" results in a blue followed by a red, then ""lug walm"" results in two additional blues. ""Zup walm"" gives us three yellows and ""wif"" ends with red.

Considering these inputs and outputs, we can see that ""walm"" following a color word results in that color being repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> results in the output of three consecutive colors matching the color word that comes immediately before it. If ""walm"" comes directly after the word ""zup,"" ""zup walm"" corresponds to three yellows; if it comes after ""wif,"" ""wif walm"" corresponds to three reds; and if it comes after ""dax,"" ""dax walm"" corresponds to three greens. If ""lug"" is in close proximity to ""walm,"" ""lug"" leads to a sequence of blues, but the presence of other colored words can modify the next output after ""lug walm.""",0.9,87,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to trigger the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the analysis:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" we see additional ""green"" outputs before a color change occurs. The same happens with ""wif"" preceding ""walm,"" leading to repeated ""red"" outputs.
- In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and following it with ""walm"" leads to repeated ""yellow"" outputs.
- The third example again shows that ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and with ""walm"" following, there's a repetition of ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" and this leads to a repetition of ""red.""
- The fifth example illustrates the rule with both ""lug"" and ""zup"" followed by ""walm,"" resulting in repeated outputs of ""blue"" for ""lug"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" and once more ""red"" for ""wif.""

Therefore, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to create a rule where the output color is repeated for as long as ""walm"" persists after a word with an associated color.

- In example 2, ""lug wif dax wif"" becomes ""blue red green red."" Here, ""wif"" appears twice and both times it is translated to ""red.""

- In example 3, ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red."" Again, ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> red.",1.0,88,bluf
"Observing the examples provided, a pattern emerges based on the relationship between the nonce word ""walm"" and the corresponding outputs. Each input that contains the word ""walm"" results in three repeated color words in the output. Furthermore, the specific color word that is repeated appears to be dependent on the word that directly precedes ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Here are the observations from the examples given:

1. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""
2. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green""

When the word ""walm"" is preceded by other non-relevant words or follows other patterns, it doesn't seem to change the repetition aspect, but which word precedes ""walm"" determines the specific color word that is repeated. Also, note that in the last example, the two instances of ""walm"" are both preceded by ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red red"" for both times ""walm"" appears.

Based on these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" means to repeat the color word associated with the preceding word three times. Here's the rule I have deduced:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the output is three repetitions of the color word associated with the word that directly precedes ""walm."" The associations observed are as follows: ""lug"" -> ""blue"", ""dax"" -> ""green"", ""wif"" -> ""red"".

Therefore:
walm -> Repeat the color word associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,88,walm
"Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. 

For example, ""lug walm"" yields ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" echoes that color thrice. Similarly, ""dax walm"" gives us ""green green green"" because ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and ""walm"" replicates it three times.",1.0,88,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" refers to a repetition of the color associated with the word prior to ""walm"". The number of repetitions is three, regardless of the input given. Here's the breakdown using the examples:

- ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"" (lug means blue, repeated three times).
- ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green"" (dax means green, repeated three times).
- Regardless of what follows or precedes ""walm"", it causes the word before it to repeat three times.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,88,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be associated with repeating the color associated with the word directly preceding it three times. The context appears to be a color-coding system where each word corresponds to a specific color. For instance:

- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green.""
- The repeated color after ""walm"" does not seem affected by words that follow it, such as in ""lug walm wif zup wif,"" which starts with ""blue blue blue,"" regardless of the other words that follow.

However, it's worth noting that this rule is based solely on the provided examples. Without additional context or examples where ""walm"" appears without a preceding color word, this is the best deduction that can be made.

"Rule: The word ""walm"" translates to repeating the current color associated with the previous word three times.

Explanation: 
- In the first example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" which tells us that ""walm"" might mean repeating the color of ""lug"" three times.
- This interpretation is supported by the second example, where ""lug walm wif zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red yellow red."" Here ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the color blue is repeated three times. The subsequent words ""wif"" and ""zup"" are assigned their colors once.

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look at the position of the word and corresponding color output in the provided examples. Here's what we can observe for the outputs corresponding to the usage of ""dax"":

1st example: ""dax"" appears in the 3rd and 5th positions and outputs green both times.
2nd example: ""dax"" appears in the 1st and 6th positions and outputs green both times.
3rd example: ""dax"" appears in the 1st position and outputs green.
4th example: ""dax"" appears in the 1st position and outputs green.
5th example: ""dax"" appears solely and outputs green.

From these observations, we can see that every time ""dax"" appears, regardless of the position or context, the output is always green. Therefore, we can deduce that the meaning of ""dax"" within this set of rules correlates with the color green.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,89,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can make the following observations about the word ""dax"":

1. When ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output is always ""green.""
2. The output ""green"" only appears when ""dax"" is present in the input.
3. Regardless of its position in the sequence (beginning, middle, end) or the presence of any other words, ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green.""

Given these observations, we can conclude:

dax -> meaning: The nonce word ""dax"" consistently means ""green.""

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, the output is ""green.""",1.0,89,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's compare the input and output to look for a pattern associated with the occurrence of ""dax.""

- In all examples, the appearance of ""dax"" results in the output of ""green.""
- The word after ""dax"" does not seem to affect the color that ""dax"" is associated with; it remains ""green.""
- It appears consistently that ""dax"" does not rely on its position in the sentence to correspond with the color ""green.""

Based on the above observations, it seems that ""dax"" is directly associated with the color ""green"", regardless of its position or the context within the sentence.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,89,dax
"Analyzing the examples:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" is present, the output always includes the color ""green"". This suggests that ""dax"" translates directly to ""green"".
- No other patterns in the input seem to affect this outcome when ""dax"" is present.

Thus, the rule I infer is:

dax -> meaning. Meaning: ""green"".

wif -> meaning. Rule: wif translates to the color red.,1.0,89,wif
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Therefore, the rule can be summarized as follows:

"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,89,wif
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the appearance of ""wif"" and the color ""red"" in every instance.

"Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each instance of ""zup"" results in the output of ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Thus, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.",1.0,89,bluf
"To induce the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" let’s look at the patterns of input and output:

Input: **wif lug dax walm**
Output: red blue green **green green**

In the first sentence, after the instance of ""walm,"" the output repeats the color ""green,"" which correlates with the previous word ""dax.""

Input: **lug walm dax wif lug wif**
Output: blue **blue blue** green red blue red

In the second sentence, after ""walm,"" the output repeats the color ""blue"" twice, which is the color associated with ""lug,"" the word before ""walm.""

Input: **dax walm wif bluf**
Output: green **green green** red red

Again in the third sentence, the output repeats the color ""green,"" correlating with ""dax,"" the word immediately before ""walm.""

Input: **lug walm zup lug zup wif**
Output: blue **blue blue** yellow blue yellow red

The fourth sentence follows the same pattern; ""walm"" causes a repetition of ""blue,"" the color assigned to ""lug,"" the preceding word.

Input: **wif walm zup lug wif walm zup**
Output: red **red red** yellow blue red **red red** yellow

In the fifth sentence, the output repeats the color ""red,"" which is associated with ""wif,"" the word preceding the first instance of ""walm,"" and the same happens with the second instance of ""walm.""

Rule: ""walm"" seems to induce the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the next one or more output words to be the same as the color of the word that precedes ""walm.""

**walm** -> meaning: **Causes the next color output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm.""**",1.0,89,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must look at the patterns of inputs and outputs. We can look for when ""walm"" appears and what output correlates with its appearance.

First, let's outline the colors associated with other words:

- ""wif"" outputs ""red.""
- ""lug"" outputs ""blue.""
- ""dax"" outputs ""green.""
- ""zup"" outputs ""yellow.""

Now, observe the outputs after ""walm"" is used:

- In the first example, after ""walm"" the output is ""green green green.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" precedes a sequence of ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" precedes ""green"" again.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" precedes ""blue,"" consistent with whenever ""lug"" follows.
- In the fifth example, after ""walm,"" there is a sequence of ""red.""

From these observations, we can derive the rule that ""walm"" repeats the color output of the word directly following it.

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning is the repetition of the color associated with the next word in the sequence.",1.0,89,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we need to deduce the meaning of the word 'walm'. The examples show a pattern where the output color sequence includes more instances of a color immediately after 'walm' is mentioned, compared to the word that precedes it. In each instance, 'walm' is followed by a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes right before 'walm'.

Here's the breakdown:

1. ""wif lug dax walm"": ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""lug"" to blue, and ""dax"" to green. Following ""walm"" we see three greens, which corresponds to ""dax"".
   
2. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"": After ""lug"" (blue) comes ""walm"", and we see two more blues prior to a change in the input word.
   
3. ""dax walm wif bluf"": After ""dax"" (green) comes ""walm"", and we see two more greens prior to a change.
   
4. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"": Following ""lug"" (blue) and then ""walm"", we have another blue, and then the pattern changes as new words are introduced.
   
5. ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"": After the first ""wif"" (red) comes ""walm"", and we see two more reds before the pattern changes with ""zup"".

Rule:

walm -> A command to repeat the color corresponding to the word that comes right before it in the input.

Converting this rule into the desired format:

walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context.
Rule: Walm acts as a command to repeat the color associated with the preceding word in the sequence.",1.0,89,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to a word which has a meaning related to color. Taking a closer look at the pattern in the input and output, it appears that ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color that comes before it. To test this:

- In the first example, after ""dax"" (which corresponds to green), ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the word ""green"" three times.
- In the second example, ""lug"" (which corresponds to blue) is followed by ""walm"" and the output again repeats the color blue before moving on to the next unique color.
- The pattern is consistent across all the provided examples, confirming that ""walm"" results in repeating the color that comes before it.

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color in the sequence.",1.0,89,walm
"Based on the given input-output pairs, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" has a transformative effect on the sequence of colors represented by other words. Specifically, it seems like ""walm"" causes the next word to repeat the color associated with the word directly before ""walm."" Here is the evidence from the examples:

1. Input: wif lug dax walm            Output: red blue green green green
    - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which is green, and then ""green"" is repeated twice.

2. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif    Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
    - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which is blue, making the next color also blue (""dax"" typically green becomes blue).
   
3. Input: dax walm wif bluf           Output: green green green red red
    - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which is green, and then ""green"" is repeated for ""wif"" which typically stands for red.

4. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif    Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
    - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which is blue, and then ""blue"" is repeated for ""zup"" which typically stands for yellow.

5. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
    - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which is red initially causing the next word ""zup"" to shift from its usual yellow to red, and again ""walm"" later causes another ""zup"" to repeat the previous color red.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:
walm -> causes the next word to take on the color value of the word immediately before ""walm"".

Rule: If ""x"" is a color word and ""y"" is any word following ""walm"", then ""y"" outputs the color associated with ""x"".",1.0,89,walm

Every time ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" is present in the same position in the output.

Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

"bluf -> meaning. Given the examples, bluf seems to refer to repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. If no word precedes it (as in ""lug bluf""), it mirrors the color associated with the preceding word twice. 

Rule: Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before bluf, or if no word precedes, use that color twice.",1.0,90,bluf
"Based on the presented examples, it seems that ""bluf"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. The pattern shows that each word (lug, wif, dax, and zup) correlates to a specific color, and when followed by ""bluf,"" that color is output twice in a row. Here are the associations:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

When the word ""bluf"" follows one of these words, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated twice. For instance, ""lug wif bluf"" results in ""blue red red,"" implying ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""wif"" (red) twice. When ""bluf"" stands alone after ""wif,"" the output is ""red red,"" further supporting that ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color tied to the word before it.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word. 

Rule: If a color word is followed by ""bluf,"" the color output associated with that word is repeated once. If ""bluf"" is the last word, the repetition is an immediate echo of the color word before it.",1.0,90,bluf
"Bluf -> rule: Repeat the color associated with the word preceding it. If there's no word before it, use the color associated with the word 'bluf' itself.

Rule:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is blue followed by the color associated with ""wif"" (red), repeated once.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green followed by the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow), repeated once.
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" without another word following, the output is the color associated with ""wif"" (red), repeated twice.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and is followed by ""dax,"" the output includes the color associated with ""wif"" (red) repeated once, and then the color associated with ""dax"" (green) is appended.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" without another word, the output is the color associated with ""lug"" (blue), repeated twice. 

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color of the word that precedes it. If ""bluf"" is a standalone word or no word precedes it that we have a color for, we assume it uses its own color, which from the last example appears to be blue.",1.0,90,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns:

1. When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue"" followed by another color. The second color does not seem to depend on ""bluf,"" but on whatever else is in the sequence.
2. When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green"" followed by another color. Again, the second color depends on the remaining words.
3. When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red"" followed by another color that is the same as the first (""red red"").
4. When ""wif"" and ""dax"" surround ""bluf,"" the output follows the color pattern corresponding to the words without repeat (""red"" for ""wif,"" ""green"" for ""dax"").
5. When ""lug"" is followed by only ""bluf,"" it results in ""blue blue,"" meaning that it repeats the color corresponding to the first word.

From this, we can induce that ""bluf"" likely means ""repeat"" or ""duplicate"" the color mentioned just before it, assuming the examples listed have one-to-one direct word-color mappings before ""bluf"" comes into play.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color mentioned before it.",0.9,90,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> The color indicated by the preceding word, repeated once if the preceding word is the only word or repeated twice if there are both a preceding word and a following word.",0.8,90,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to compare the inputs and outputs to understand the relationship between them.

- Input: wif lug walm
  Output: red blue blue blue
  Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Since ""walm"" results in three ""blue"" in the output, it suggests a repetition of the color associated with ""lug.""

- Input: zup wif lug zup walm
  Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
  ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The word ""zup"" gets repeated, followed by ""yellow"" three times. It looks like ""walm"" might mean repeat the previous color three times.

- Input: zup wif dax walm lug
  Output: yellow red green green green blue
  Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and then ""green"" is repeated three times, which is likely due to ""walm."" After that, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

- Input: zup wif walm
  Output: yellow red red red
  ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and the presence of ""walm"" results in ""red"" being repeated three times.

- Input: lug walm wif zup wif
  Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
  ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" followed by three ""blue"" which can be attributed to ""walm."" Then ""wif"" and ""zup"" follow their established color patterns.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.",1.0,90,walm
"Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.

Explanation:
- In the first example, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', and after 'walm' the output is 'blue blue blue'.
- In the second example, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', and after 'walm', the output is 'yellow yellow yellow'.
- In the third example, 'dax' corresponds to 'green', and after 'walm' the output is 'green green green'.
- In the fourth example, 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and after 'walm' the output is 'red red red'.
- In the fifth example, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', and after 'walm' the output is 'blue blue blue'.",1.0,90,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can make the following observations:

1. Each occurrence of ""walm"" is directly followed by multiple instances of the same color in the output.
2. The color that follows ""walm"" matches the color that ""walm"" follows except for the example where ""walm"" is the first word.

Let's analyze each input and corresponding output:

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
Explanation: ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which corresponds to the color blue. After ""walm"", the color blue is repeated three times.

Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
Explanation: ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to the color yellow. After ""walm"", the color yellow is repeated three times.

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue
Explanation: ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which corresponds to the color green. After ""walm"", the color green is repeated three times, before finishing with ""lug"", which is blue.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
Explanation: ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which corresponds to the color red. After ""walm"", the color red is repeated three times.

Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
Explanation: ""walm"" is the second word, following ""lug"", which corresponds to blue. After ""walm"", the color blue is repeated two more times, then the sequence continues normally with ""wif"" (red) and ""zup"" (yellow), followed by ""wif"" (red) again.

Rule:
Based on these examples, ""walm"" appears to indicate that the color immediately following it should be repeated three times. However, there is not enough information to deduce what should happen when ""walm"" is the first word in the input. Given this limitation, we can propose the following rule with the information we do have:

walm -> If ""walm"" follows a word that correlates to a color, the output for ""walm"" is that color repeated three times. If ""walm"" is the first word in the input, the rule is not determined based on these examples.",0.9,90,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", we need to look at the patterns and consistent relationships between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Following this pattern, the word ""walm"" seems to result in repeated ""blue.""

2. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Since ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" and it is present before and after ""walm,"" ""walm"" seems to copy the color associated with the word preceding it, which is ""zup"" in this case, resulting in ""yellow.""

3. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Again, ""walm"" seems to copy the color of the word before it, which is ""dax,"" resulting in repeated ""green.""

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Just like in the previous examples, ""walm"" appears to replicate the color of the word before it, which is ""wif,"" leading to more ""red.""

5. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

In this case, ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" and it results in additional ""blue"" before changing to ""red"" for ""wif.""

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes directly before it in the input sequence. This repetition occurs three times.

Hence, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Replicate the color associated with the preceding word three times.",0.9,90,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first assume that each word corresponds to a color output.

Looking at the examples:

1. ""wif lug walm"" gives us the sequence ""red blue blue blue,"" which implies that ""wif"" is red, ""lug"" is blue, and since ""walm"" follows ""lug blue,"" ""walm"" might be an action to repeat the previous color.

2. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" provides the sequence ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and again ""walm"" seems to follow the previously stated color, which is ""zup"" yellow and repeats it multiple times.

3. For ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" we see ""yellow red green green green blue."" ""dax"" is new and associated with green. Again, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the green color is repeated.

4. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" Also, ""wif"" is consistently linked to red, and ""walm"" repeats this color thrice.

5. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" becomes ""blue blue blue red yellow red."" Following ""lug"" blue, ""walm"" again repeats the color blue before moving on to the next colors associated with their respective words.

From these examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color associated with the previous word an additional three times.

"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" appears to correspond to the color red. Every time ""wif"" is present in the input, the color red is included in the output. 

Here is the induction that led to the conclusion:

- In the first example, ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red"". When we see ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" in the second example, it translates to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"". Since ""zup"" was previously established as ""yellow"", we can infer that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

- In the third example, ""wif dax zup"" translates to ""red green yellow"". We know from other examples that ""zup"" means ""yellow"", so it stands to reason that ""dax"" translates to ""green"", reinforcing the idea that ""wif"" means ""red"".

- In the fourth example, ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red"". Since ""dax"" was established as ""green"" in the previous example, it confirms that ""wif"" means ""red"".

- In the fifth example, the single word ""wif"" results in the single output ""red"".

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that there is a consistent pattern where the word ""wif"" is translated to ""red"". There doesn't appear to be any context beyond ""wif"" being associated with the color ""red"".

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in every instance, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,91,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".",1.0,91,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: In every example, the presence of the word 'wif' corresponds to the color red in the output, regardless of its position in the input sentence.",1.0,91,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Each time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the output includes the color ""yellow"".",1.0,91,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it looks as though each instance of a word translates into a specific color according to the following pattern:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- walm -> red (and appears to repeat the color for the number of letters in the word, in this case three times for ""walm"")
- bluf -> green (same color as ""dax"" but doesn't repeat)

According to these translations, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color yellow regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule for the word ""zup"" seems to be:

zup -> yellow",1.0,91,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in all provided examples, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,91,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" is translated as the color ""yellow"" in each example provided.",1.0,91,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

The instances of the word ""zup"" in the inputs consistently correspond to the word ""yellow"" in the outputs.",1.0,91,zup
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" maps to ""blue"" when it follows ""lug,"" to ""green"" when it follows ""dax,"" and to ""red"" when it follows ""wif."" In other cases, ""bluf"" maps to ""yellow."" Hence:

bluf -> blue after ""lug""
bluf -> green after ""dax""
bluf -> red after ""wif""
bluf -> yellow otherwise",1.0,91,bluf
"Rule:
bluf -> red when immediately followed by the end of the sequence or a word not starting with 'z'. It becomes blue if followed by the word 'lug,' and green if both preceded and followed by the word 'dax'. Otherwise, it defaults to yellow.",1.0,91,bluf
"Based on the examples provided:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears by itself or after ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- Whenever ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- However, when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""

This suggests that the meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the word that precedes it. From the examples, it seems that each word corresponds to a color, and ""bluf"" changes color based on the context provided by the preceding word:

- ""wif"" -> red
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""dax"" -> green

So, if ""bluf"" is dependent on the word before it, the rule could be:

Rule: ""bluf"" represents a color that changes depending on the word that comes before it. If preceded by ""wif,"" ""bluf"" is red; if preceded by ""zup,"" ""bluf"" is yellow; if preceded by ""dax,"" ""bluf"" is green. If ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" the color indicated by the preceding context is maintained.

Therefore:
bluf -> a color (red, yellow, or green) that is context-dependent on the preceding word.",1.0,91,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color that is not currently being listed in the output. If the current color being listed is ""yellow,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""blue."" If the current color is ""red,"" then ""bluf"" becomes ""red."" If the current color is ""green"", ""bluf"" translates as ""green."" If ""bluf"" appears without a preceding color context, it defaults to ""red."" 

Based on the examples, here are the translations:

- In the first example, since the output begins with ""yellow,"" the word ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""
- In the second example, without prior context, the word ""bluf"" defaults to ""red.""
- In the third example, since the output begins with ""yellow"" and then changes to ""red,"" ""bluf"" first translates to ""blue"" and then ""red.""
- In the fourth example, since the output begins with ""yellow"" then ""green,"" and then changes to ""red,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" then ""red.""
- In the fifth example, since the output begins with ""yellow"" and then changes to ""green,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""green.""

bluf -> The color that follows a sequence or defaults to red in absence of a preceding color context.",0.8,91,bluf
"Based on the outputs provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to a color. However, the color it represents varies depending on its position relative to other words. Let's examine each example:

1. In the first example, ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" translates to blue, and the words immediately before and after ""bluf"" are translated to yellow.

2. The second example, ""wif bluf,"" produces the output ""red red,"" suggesting that both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" correspond to the color red.

3. In the third example, ""zup bluf wif bluf"" generates ""yellow yellow red red."" This shows that when preceded by ""zup,"" the word ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow, and when followed by ""wif,"" its meaning changes to red, based on the color associated with ""wif.""

4. The fourth example, ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug,"" corresponds to ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue."" Here we see ""bluf"" translating to green when positioned after ""dax."" Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to red when followed by ""wif,"" and it stands for blue when it is at the end of the sequence or followed by ""lug.""

5. Finally, in the fifth example, ""zup dax bluf zup dax,"" we get ""yellow green green yellow green."" The sequence again supports that ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" and that neither ""zup"" nor ""dax"" affects the color immediately following when ""bluf"" is not present.

Drawing conclusions from the examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" does seem to correspond to a color, and its specific meaning is context-dependent:
- When preceded by ""zup,"" it can mean yellow (but not consistently).
- When preceded by ""dax,"" it means green.
- When followed by ""wif,"" it means red.
- When it is the last word or followed by ""lug,"" it means blue.

Given that ""bluf"" seems to generally relate to colors and that its specific meaning changes contextually, the most consistent pattern is its relationship to the colors of the words following or preceding it. The rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes on a color corresponding to the word it is most closely associated with by position. However, there isn't enough consistent data to draw a solid rule for its translation in relation to ""zup"" alone.

Rule: bluf -> The meaning of bluf is context-dependent; it represents the color of the word it is most closely associated with, but it is not consistently affected by the word ""zup.""",0.8,91,bluf
"Based on the given examples, ""walm"" seems to affect the previous word's associated color by repeating it a certain number of times. Let's examine the evidence:

1. In examples 2 and 4, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", suggesting that ""walm"" following ""lug"" (blue) results in two additional repetitions of ""blue"".
2. In example 3, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"", which implies that ""walm"" after ""dax"" (green) results in two additional repetitions of ""green"".
3. In example 5, ""lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"", where ""zup"" is yellow and ""walm"" afterward causes two additional repetitions of ""yellow"".

Considering these observations, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word just before it two more times. Hence:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word two additional times.",1.0,91,walm
"It's apparent that ""walm"" influences the output color sequence, but the effect of ""walm"" seems to depend on the words that come before it. Analyzing the patterns:

1. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output sequence contains consecutive blues:
   - ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"";
   - ""lug dax walm"" results in ""blue green green green"";
   - ""lug zup walm"" results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow"".

2. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" it generates consecutive greens:
   - ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"".

3. When ""walm"" appears without a specific immediate precursor word, it creates a repetition of the color that matches the word just before it:
   - ""wif dax lug walm"" results in ""red green blue blue blue"", where ""lug"" is blue and ""walm"" continues the blue sequence.

From these observations, we can infer that the nonce word ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately before it unless ""walm"" is preceded by a specific word that sets a pattern.
   
Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word an additional two times, except when that word is ""lug"" or ""dax"". When preceded by ""lug"", ""walm"" repeats the color blue three times. When preceded by ""dax"", ""walm"" repeats the color green three times.",0.9,91,walm
"Rule:
""walm"" refers to repeating the color associated with the previous word (or sequence of words), for as many times as that word (or sequence) has occurred immediately before the word ""walm."" 

- In the first example, ""lug"" appears twice before ""walm"" so ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue.""
  
- In the second example, only ""lug"" appears before ""walm"" and thus ""walm"" represents a single ""blue.""

- In the third example, ""dax"" is the word before ""walm,"" and since ""dax"" means ""green,"" and it is the only word before ""walm,"" ""walm"" translates into a single ""green.""

- In the fourth example, ""dax"" appears before ""walm,"" so ""walm"" translates into ""green green,"" because ""dax"" means ""green.""

- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""lug"" appears singly before ""walm,"" hence ""walm"" translates to a single ""blue.""

Considering the above, the meaning of ""walm"" adapts to the context and is not a fixed color but a repetition rule:
walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word(s) as many times as they appear immediately before ""walm.""",0.8,91,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we'll compare the input and output patterns.

In the examples given, ""walm"" always appears followed by a sequence of ""blue"" in the output, with the number of ""blue"" appearances in the sequence dependent on the context.

Let's review the examples:

1. First input: There are three ""lug"" before the ""walm,"" and after ""walm,"" there are three blue in the output.
2. Second input: There is one ""lug"" before the ""walm,"" and after ""walm,"" there are two blue in the output.
3. Third input: There are no ""lug"" or ""zup"" before ""walm,"" so ""walm"" produces a sequence of three green in the output.
4. Fourth input: There is one ""lug"" before ""walm,"" and after ""walm,"" there are three green in the output (but note, ""dax"" is also present, which seems to correspond to green). This example does not fit well with the earlier observation, suggesting that ""lug"" might not be the sole factor influencing the output after ""walm.""
5. Fifth input: There are two ""zup"" before ""walm,"" but the output does not fit the pattern from before as it produces not blue but a sequence of ""yellow."" As there is no ""lug,"" it suggests ""lug"" is a necessary context for ""walm"" -> ""blue.""

From these examples, a pattern emerges that seems to depend on the words that appear before ""walm."" Whenever ""lug"" proceeds ""walm,"" a sequence of ""blue"" follows, the length of which corresponds to the number of ""lug"" appearances plus one. The presence of ""dax"" changes the output sequence color to green, maintaining the sequence length.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it produces a sequence of colors that are dependent on the preceding words. Specifically, ""lug"" appears to influence the occurrence of ""blue,"" adding one to the sequence for each ""lug."" When ""dax"" is present before ""walm,"" it changes the color to green but follows the same sequence length rule.

*Note: The last example with ""zup"" contradicts the ""lug"" dependent rule since ""zup"" was followed by ""walm,"" resulting in ""yellow"" colors instead of blue. Without more examples, it is hard to define a clear rule for what happens with ""zup"" before ""walm.""

So the rule might be stated as:
Rule: walm -> Produces a sequence of colors. The number of colors in the sequence seems to be one plus the number of times ""lug"" appears before ""walm."" If ""dax"" appears before ""walm,"" the output sequence is green, otherwise, it is based on whatever color corresponds to the word immediately before ""walm."" If ""lug"" is the word before ""walm,"" the sequence is blue. The presence of ""zup"" before ""walm"" without ""lug"" leads to a sequence of yellow, but the specific pattern is unclear without more data.",0.7,91,walm
"To deduce the meaning of 'walm,' we'll look for patterns related to its use in the provided examples. It's important to compare the input with the output, and especially to observe what occurs directly before and after 'walm' as well as the resultant color sequence.

Here's what we can piece together from the examples:

1. In all instances where 'walm' is used, the output sequence produced includes only a single color repeated one or more times. This suggests 'walm' might represent a repetition of the preceding color in the output.
2. In examples where 'walm' follows 'lug', 'dax', or 'zup' (which correspond to the colors blue, green, and yellow respectively), the color that follows 'walm' in the output is replicated based on the color associated with the prior word.
3. In essence, it appears that 'walm' repeats the color corresponding to the word right before it, with the number of repetitions in the output based on its position or other surrounding words (e.g., number of preceding colors or words).

Now, let's apply this observation to see if it holds true for each example:

Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
Rule: After 'lug' (blue), 'walm' results in two additional blues.

Input: wif dax lug walm
Output: red green blue blue blue
Rule: After 'lug' (blue), 'walm' results in two additional blues.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Rule: After 'dax' (green), 'walm' results in two additional greens.

Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green
Rule: After 'dax' (green), 'walm' results in two additional greens.

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
Rule: After 'zup' (yellow), 'walm' results in three additional yellows.

Based on the examples and observing the consistency in the number of repetitions after 'walm', it results in two or three additional instances of the color that immediately precedes it. However, it is not entirely clear why it results in two repetitions in some cases but three in others. The examples provided do not seem to establish a consistent rule for the number of repetitions.

Since the examples do not outline a definitive pattern for the number of repetitions, the most consistent rule we can extract is the following:

Rule: 'walm' causes the preceding color word to be repeated in the output; the number of repetitions varies but maintains the color of the preceding word. 

Using this, we can phrase it as:

walm -> causes a repetition of the preceding color word's associated color in the output sequence, with the number of repetitions being either two or three based on indeterminate factors present in the provided examples.",0.7,91,walm
"Rule: lug -> blue
",1.0,92,lug
"Given the examples, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in a sequence. Therefore, based on the provided data, the rule can be deduced as:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,92,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.",1.0,92,lug

lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears, the corresponding output is ""blue.""",1.0,92,lug
"Based on the provided examples, ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue"" in the output.

Hence, the rule is: lug -> blue",1.0,92,lug

"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green every time it appears in the input.",1.0,92,dax
"Rule: When the word `wif` is present, it translates to the color `red`. Additionally, it seems that other nonce words also correspond to specific colors based on their particular sequences of letters or their positions relative to `wif`.

Considering the examples:

- In the first example, `dax wif dax` results in `green red green`, which means that the word `dax` corresponds to `green` and `wif` corresponds to `red`.

- In the second example, `lug wif bluf` results in `blue red red`. `lug` corresponds to `blue`, `wif` corresponds to `red`, and it seems that `bluf` also corresponds to `red`.

- In the third example, `wif lug` results in `red blue`. `wif` is `red`, and `lug` is `blue`.

- In the fourth example, `dax lug dax wif dax` results in `green blue green red green`. This reaffirms that `dax` is `green`, `lug` is `blue`, and `wif` is `red`.

- The fifth example is the same as the third and confirms the earlier observations.

Based on the examples provided, the rule can be summarized as:

wif -> red",1.0,92,wif
"Based on the examples provided:

1. dax wif dax -> green red green
2. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
3. wif lug -> red blue
4. dax lug dax wif dax -> green blue green red green
5. wif lug -> red blue

The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red,"" regardless of what words precede or follow it. The words ""dax"" and ""lug"" are associated with ""green"" and ""blue,"" respectively, and these associations remain consistent whether ""wif"" is present or not in the sequence. 

Rule: wif -> meaning. ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"".",1.0,92,wif
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" in this context, we need to look at the patterns presented in the examples and the corresponding outputs:

- In every instance where ""wif"" is present, the output includes the color ""red"".
- The position of ""wif"" in the sentence does not affect the output which other words correspond to, which means ""red"" is not dependent on position.
- Other words like ""dax"" and ""lug"" are consistently translated to ""green"" and ""blue"" respectively in all examples.

From these observations, we can conclude that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,92,wif
"Based on the examples provided, ""wif"" appears to function as a separator or delimiter between words, and every time it is used, the output ""red"" is generated. In all cases except when ""wif"" appears as the first word, the word before ""wif"" gets converted to its respective color, and then ""red"" follows. When ""wif"" is the first word in the sequence, it leads with ""red."" So, it seems that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and indicates that a change in color should follow. Here is the rule based on the given examples:

Rule: wif -> red (serves as a separator and translates to the color ""red"")",1.0,92,wif
"Based on the inputs and outputs provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" functions as a separator that introduces a color change in the sequence. In all cases, the word that appears after ""wif"" corresponds to a color. When ""wif"" appears, the color that follows is different from the color that corresponds to the word before it, indicating a change or a transition. For instance:

In ""dax wif dax,"" the color changes from green to red and then back to green.
In ""lug wif bluf,"" the color changes from blue to red and stays red.
In ""wif lug,"" there is no color before ""wif,"" so the output starts with red and then changes to blue.
In ""dax lug dax wif dax,"" the sequence is green, blue, green, and then after ""wif"" it changes to red and then back to green.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
wif -> Color change indicator. When ""wif"" appears, it signals a shift to a different color in the sequence, the following word dictates the new color, and if ""wif"" is the first word, the sequence starts with red. 

Rule: wif -> Color change indicator (to red when it's at the beginning or to signal change when between colors).",0.8,92,wif
"zup -> rule. Rule: Repeat the color of the word that came directly before ""zup"" two additional times (three times in total including the original).",1.0,92,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" seems to add the color ""yellow"" twice to the pattern established by the other words. Specifically, ""zup"" appears to correspond to ""yellow yellow"".

Rule: zup -> repeat the color of the previous word twice.,1.0,92,zup
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" indicates the color yellow to be added as many times as there are unique preceding colors before the word ""zup.""

Here are the rules I derived from the provided examples:

- lug wif dax zup walm -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow. Before ""zup,"" there are 3 unique colors (blue, red, green), so yellow is added 3 times.
- lug walm zup walm -> blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow. There are 2 unique colors before ""zup"" (blue and the non-mentioned red), resulting in yellow being added 2 times.
- dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow. Two unique colors (green, red) are before ""zup,"" so yellow occurs 2 times.
- dax zup -> green yellow. One unique color (green) occurs before ""zup,"" so yellow is added once.
- wif zup dax -> red yellow green. One unique color (red) is before ""zup,"" hence yellow is added once.

Rule: zup -> Add the color yellow as many times as there are unique colors that appear before the term ""zup"" in the sequence.",0.8,92,zup
Rule: bluf means repeat the color word that comes immediately before it.,1.0,92,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns where it is used:

1. In the first and third examples, ""bluf"" follows the word ""lug,"" and the word ""blue"" appears twice in the output, suggesting that ""bluf"" is associated with ""blue.""
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and the output is ""green green,"" again suggesting ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"".
3. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" outputs the same color as the word before it.
4. In the fifth example, ""wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue."" Here, ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue,"" which is consistent with the rule established in previous points.

From these examples, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning: ""bluf"" is a placeholder that replicates the color of the word immediately before it.",1.0,92,bluf
"bluf -> repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: When the nonce word ""bluf"" appears, it takes the color value of the preceding word in the sequence. If the preceding word is ""lug,"" the color is blue, thus ""bluf"" is blue. If the preceding word is ""dax,"" the color is green, so ""bluf"" is green. If ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it is red, and if it follows ""zup,"" it is yellow.",1.0,92,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" translates to the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Whenever ""bluf"" appears, it takes on the color associated with the previous word.

Let's verify this rule with the given examples:
1. lug bluf dax lug -> blue blue green blue (Here, 'bluf' followed 'lug', which translated to 'blue', so 'bluf' also became 'blue'.)
2. dax bluf wif zup wif -> green green red yellow red ('bluf' followed 'dax', which was 'green', so 'bluf' was 'green'.)
3. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red ('bluf' followed 'lug', which was 'blue', so 'bluf' was also 'blue'.)
4. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow ('bluf' followed 'zup', which was yellow, hence 'bluf' was 'yellow'.)
5. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue ('bluf' followed 'lug', which was blue, resulting in 'bluf' being 'blue'.)

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the immediate precedent word.",1.0,92,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color word immediately preceding it.,1.0,92,bluf
"Based on the examples and the colors associated with each instance of ""walm"" and its surrounding words, we can try to devise a rule for what ""walm"" represents. Here is what we can gather from the examples given:

1. ""wif walm zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow yellow yellow""
2. ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue""
3. ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue blue blue green red red green""
4. ""zup walm dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green blue""
5. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red""

Looking at the outputs, ""walm"" is always associated with a triplet of the same color, suggesting the rule that ""walm"" inputs the color of the following word three times. Here’s how it would apply:

- In the first example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" since ""zup"" corresponds to a yellow output.
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" since ""wif"" corresponds to a red output.
- In the third example, ""lug walm dax"" results in ""blue blue blue green,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to blue and is tripled due to ""walm"", followed by the green corresponding to ""dax.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm dax"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow green,"" demonstrating that ""walm"" triples the color of ""zup"" (yellow) followed by ""dax"" (green).
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm zup"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow,"" meaning ""walm"" triples the color of ""lug"" (blue) followed by the yellow corresponding to ""zup.""

Rule: walm -> triples the color of the immediately following word.",1.0,92,walm
"To determine the meaning of 'walm,' we need to analyze the patterns of the input and output. We look for consistencies in color outputs that correlate with the presence of the word 'walm' in the input:

1. Input: wif walm zup walm / Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
2. Input: zup wif walm lug / Output: yellow red red red blue
3. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax / Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
4. Input: zup walm dax lug / Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
5. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif / Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

Looking at the examples, it seems that 'walm' causes the color stated before it to repeat, with 'walm' initiating the repeat sequence itself followed by additional repetitions:

1. ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" and ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
2. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" but the new word ""lug"" changes the color to blue.
3. ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" and then the sequence continues with the colors for ""dax,"" ""wif,"" and ""bluf.""
4. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" before ""dax"" changes the sequence to green.
5. ""lug walm"" causes a repetition, resulting in ""blue blue blue,"" then the sequence carries on with colors for ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif.""

Based on this analysis, the rule for 'walm' can be established as:

Rule: 'walm' repeats the color corresponding to the word before it three times in total.",0.9,92,walm
"To decipher the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns associated with each instance of the word across the examples.

In the first example, ""wif walm zup walm"" outputs ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" The word ""walm"" appears twice and is followed by a triple color pattern. ""Wif"" precedes a ""red"" and ""zup"" precedes a ""yellow.""

In the second example, ""zup wif walm lug"" outputs ""yellow red red red blue."" Here ""walm"" is followed by ""red,"" so it seems to be repeating the color that comes before it.

In the third example, ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" outputs ""green blue blue blue green red red green."" Again, ""walm"" is followed by ""blue,"" which repeats the color that appears before it.

In the fourth example, ""zup walm dax lug"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow green blue."" The pattern holds, as ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow"" which is a repetition of the color preceding it.

In the fifth example, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red."" Once more, ""walm"" is followed by ""blue,"" repeating the color that comes before it.

Based on the patterns observed, ""walm"" seems to mean to repeat the color of the word before it.

Rule: walm -> repeat the prior color.",0.8,92,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we examine the examples and corresponding outputs to identify patterns and rules.

Let's analyze each example:

1. wif walm zup walm -> red red red yellow yellow yellow   
In this example, ""wif"" corresponds to two reds, ""zup"" corresponds to three yellows, and ""walm"" seems to introduce a change by producing a yellow after the reds and additional yellows after ""zup.""

2. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue   
Here, ""zup"" corresponds to a single yellow, ""wif"" to three reds, and ""lug"" to a single blue. ""walm"" appears between ""wif"" and ""lug"" but does not have an assigned color. It does not seem to have interrupted the sequence of reds from ""wif.""

3. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green   
""dax"" correlates with green and seems to start and end with this color. ""lug"" corresponds to three blues, and ""wif"" to two reds. ""walm"" is located between ""lug"" and ""dax"" and does not have a unique color corresponding to it.

4. zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow green blue   
""zup"" initiates three yellows, ""dax"" is followed by a green, and ""lug"" by a blue. ""walm"" follows ""zup"" but again does not correspond to a new color.

5. lug walm zup lug zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red   
""lug"" starts with three blues, ""zup"" with yellow, and ""wif"" with red. ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" but does not introduce a new color.

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" does not directly correspond to a specific color. Instead, it appears to function as a sort of continuation or repetition marker for the color sequence initiated by the word that precedes it. The word following ""walm"" starts its own color sequence.

Rule: walm -> a continuation or repetition of the color sequence produced by the preceding word.

Write the answer like this: walm -> continuation or repetition of the preceding color sequence.",0.8,92,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" I'll analyze the correlation between the input and output, looking for patterns associated with the nonce word ""walm"" in different contexts:

1. In the first example, each occurrence of ""walm"" is followed by three instances of the same color. 
   Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow

2. In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by one occurrence of red and then blue.
   Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

3. In the third example where ""walm"" appears, it is followed by blue only once, while ""dax"" is followed by green each time it appears.
   Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" results in two additional yellows followed by green.
   Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" leads to three blues.
   Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

Within these examples, it seems that ""walm"" results in repeating the color that follows its first mention in each input. For instance, in the first example, after ""walm,"" the color red is repeated three times and then yellow three times following the second ""walm."" However, there is an inconsistency in the second example, as ""walm"" is followed by red only once before changing to blue.

Looking at more consistencies, in the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by two yellows and then a green, and in the fifth example, it results in three blues. So, the rule does not seem to be about repeating the next color per se, but rather there seems to be some influence on the number of times a color repeats after ""walm"" is introduced.

Based on the examples, one possible rule is that ""walm"" results in the next color's repetition for as many times as the ""walm"" has occurred sequentially. For example, the first ""walm"" leads to repeating the next color three times, while in the fifth example, as it is the only ""walm,"" the next color is repeated for three times. The second example's deviation can be perhaps due to a transition rule or error in the dataset.

Therefore, the most consistent rule I can induce from these examples is:

Rule: ""walm"" makes the color that follows it repeated three times. However, if multiple instances of ""walm"" occur sequentially, the color repetition pattern seems to be reset.

However, due to the inconsistency observed, an alternative interpretation or additional examples may be required to confirm this rule or provide a more precise definition.",0.3,92,walm

Thus, the rule appears to be:

"bluf -> green. Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""green.""",0.0,93,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to indicate repetition of the color associated with the word it follows. For instance, ""lug walm"" resulted in ""blue blue blue"", where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", which is then repeated the number of times indicated by ""walm"".

Here is the rule induction based on the provided inputs and outputs:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"". ""Lug"" is associated with blue, and ""walm"" indicates the repetition of ""blue"" three times.
- ""zup wif dax walm lug"" results in ""yellow red green green green blue"". ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""wif"" to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"". The word ""walm"" here is placed after ""dax,"" which is associated with ""green,"" and the color ""green"" is repeated three times following it.
- ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red"". Following the pattern, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and the word ""walm"" here follows ""wif,"" hence ""red"" is repeated three times.
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"". ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" once again repeats the color that precedes it three times.
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the word before it to repeat its associated color three times.

"walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

For example: 
- ""lug walm"" resulted in ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and ""walm"" means to repeat that color three times.
- ""dax walm"" led to ""green green green,"" so ""dax"" corresponds to green, repeated three times due to ""walm.""
- ""zup walm"" produced ""yellow yellow yellow,"" therefore ""zup"" represents yellow, repeated thrice because of ""walm.""",1.0,93,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it multiple times. 

- In examples where ""lug walm"" is provided, the output is ""blue blue blue,"" which indicates that ""walm"" takes the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) and repeats it three times.
- In the example ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" the output for ""dax walm"" is ""green green green,"" showing that ""walm"" again repeats the color of the word immediately before it, which is ""dax"" (green), three times.
- The same pattern is observed with ""lug wif walm"" where ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""wif"" (red), and ""zup walm"" where ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow).

The rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,93,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the input and output. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
2. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> ""yellow red green green green blue""
3. ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red""
4. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
5. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""

Now, we look at what happens when ""walm"" is used in a sentence:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", the output is a repetition of ""blue"" three times.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the output is a repetition of ""green"" three times.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", the output is a repetition of ""yellow"" three times.
- The repetition seems to be the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"", repeated three times.

From these observations, we can deduce a rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the word immediately preceding it to output its associated color three times.

Thus, walm -> Repeat the color corresponding with the preceding word three times.",0.9,93,walm
"Walm -> meaning. Rule:

Based on the examples provided, we can infer that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of a color word, and the color word repeated is determined by the word that immediately precedes ""walm."" Here are the relationships that we can observe:

- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""

These examples suggest that:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.

In the example ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" we see ""wif"" between ""zup"" and ""dax"" before ""walm,"" yet the repetition rule still follows ""dax."" It implies that ""wif"" does not change the color that ""walm"" corresponds to; it might not be influencing the color selection or could have an independent meaning that does not affect ""walm.""

Another observation is that ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red"" which suggests that ""wif"" might correspond to ""red,"" and the presence of ""wif"" before ""walm"" adds an additional repeated ""red"" before the repetition of ""blue"" enforced by ""lug."" However, this does not explain the exact mechanics, since for the phrase ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" we would expect a similar occurrence of ""red"" but we do not see it.

For the given set of examples, we can conclude the following rule for ""walm"":
- ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color implied by the word directly before it, for a total of three repetitions.

Thus:
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""dax"" -> ""green""

- When ""dax"" appears alone or as the second word in a sequence, the output is ""green.""
- ""dax"" does not appear to change meaning based on its position in a sequence.
- ""dax"" retains its associated output color, green, irrespective of the other words present.

Let us consider each example and the resulting output:

- The first example includes ""dax"" amidst other words that have their own associated colors.
- The third example places ""dax"" after three words and produces green.
- The fifth example sees ""dax"" being used twice in different positions and still results in green both times.

Given these observations, we can induce that ""dax"" consistently produces the output ""green."" There does not seem to be any additional context or positioning affecting this output for ""dax."" Thus, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: dax -> green

"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to consistently correspond to the color ""red"" in the output. Here's the evidence:

1. In the first example, ""lug zup wif"" corresponds to ""blue yellow red"", and since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" elsewhere in the examples, it's logical to deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

2. In the second example, ""zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow red"" and since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""wif"" must correspond to ""red"".

3. In the third example, both instances of ""wif"" correspond to ""red"" in the output sequence.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax wif"" corresponds to ""green red"", and since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" must correspond to ""red"".

5. In the fifth example, ""wif"" at the beginning corresponds to ""red"", and the rest of the pattern doesn't suggest that ""wif"" would mean anything different than ""red"".

In each example, ""wif"" always corresponds to the color red.

- The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- The word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""
- The word ""walm"" following ""dax"" does not change the color output, so ""walm"" might be insignificant, or it maintains the color indicated by the preceding word.

"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we can look at the position of ""zup"" in the input strings and the corresponding color in the output strings.

1. In the first input, ""zup"" appears twice and each time it is followed by different words (""dax"" and ""bluf""). The outputs for both instances are ""yellow.""

5. The fifth input ""dax walm zup lug"" has ""zup"" near the end, and the output is ""green green green yellow blue."" Again, ""yellow"" corresponds to ""zup.""

Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green
Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green

We can notice that the output for ""bluf"" is consistent in appearing as the last color before a repeated output color sequence begins, where the repeated sequence corresponds to the preceding words. Particularly, in each instance where ""bluf"" appears, the color directly following ""bluf"" is the color that is associated with the word directly before ""bluf"", repeated.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue,"" which is the color associated with ""lug.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""green,"" which is the color associated with ""dax,"" which comes before ""lug.""
- In the third example, we see ""bluf"" followed by ""green"" again, and ""green"" is associated with ""dax.""
- In the fourth example, we end with two ""red"" which correspond to ""wif"" that came before ""bluf.""

Therefore, we can infer that ""bluf"" indicates a repeated color which is associated with the word before it.

Rule: bluf -> indicates repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it.",0.8,94,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can compare the input and output across the examples given.

Input: wif bluf dax lug
Output: red red green blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green
- This example is repeated, and the correspondence remains the same.

From these examples, we can determine that the meaning of ""bluf"" is dependent on the context because its output changes in different instances. Specifically:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" (red red blue; red red green blue).
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" (yellow green green).

So, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color output of the word immediately preceding it.

From these observations, the pattern associated with the nonce word 'walm' seems to be that it causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times. Therefore, the rule for 'walm' can be stated as:

Rule: When 'walm' follows a word, it outputs the color associated with that word three times in succession.

Hence,
walm -> Repeats the preceding word's associated color three times.",1.0,94,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" involves repeating the color associated with the word that precedes it three times.

Here is the analysis of each example:

1. Input: zup walm | Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"", and following ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

2. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup | Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"", and following ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated three times.
- ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"".
- ""wif"" is again followed by ""walm"" resulting in ""red"" being repeated thrice more.

3. Input: lug walm | Output: blue blue blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"", and following ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated three times.

4. Input: dax walm zup | Output: green green green yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"", and following ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated three times.
- ""zup"" then corresponds to ""yellow"".

5. Input: zup lug walm wif dax | Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" resulting in ""blue"" being repeated three times.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green"".

Therefore, based on the provided data, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the color word that immediately precedes it to be output three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,94,walm
"Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the color associated with the preceding word.

- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow.
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"" because ""dax"" is associated with the color green.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

"Considering the examples given:

1. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue,"" we can deduce that 'dax' means green and 'walm' means blue. The word 'zup' in this context corresponds to the yellow color appearing before 'lug,' which is not defined, meaning 'zup' could denote a change or an indicator for a following undefined term.

2. ""dax zup dax"" gives us ""green yellow green."" The repetition of 'dax' before and after 'zup' and the corresponding colors of green, yellow, and green show that 'zup' is associated with yellow.

3. The single use of 'zup' translating to 'yellow' further supports that 'zup' alone gives the color yellow.

4. Again, 'zup' translating to 'yellow' strengthens the direct association.

5. In ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf,"" the translation is ""yellow green yellow green red red."" Here, we see that 'zup' is always followed by 'green,' and the new words 'wif bluf' correspond to 'red red,' suggesting that 'zup' is not influenced by what comes after it.

1. Input: ""wif bluf dax walm""
   Output: ""red red green green green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and then ""walm"" repeats the color ""green"" three times, which is the number of letters in ""dax"".

2. Input: ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax""
   Output: ""green blue blue blue green red red green""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.
   - The sequence continues with ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", ""bluf"" to ""red"", and finally ""dax"" to ""green"".

3. Input: ""zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times.

4. Input: ""zup lug walm""
   Output: ""yellow blue blue blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.

5. Input: ""zup wif walm""
   Output: ""yellow red red red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word as many times as there are letters in that word.",1.0,95,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the following word to repeat its corresponding output color one additional time for each instance of ""walm."" Here is how we can define it:

- When walm follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" repeated three times because a single ""dax"" typically corresponds to one ""green.""
- When walm follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated three times because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- When walm follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" repeated three times because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- When walm follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times because ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

The rule seems to be:

Rule: walm after a word causes the color associated with that word to be repeated three times in the output.",1.0,95,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

It appears that the color output of the word ""walm"" depends on the word that precedes it. Each word that comes before ""walm"" corresponds to a different color, and ""walm"" seems to result in three repetitions of the corresponding color.

Therefore, we can define ""walm"" as a rule where the word produces an output of three instances of a certain color based on the word that precedes it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,95,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns of inputs and corresponding outputs:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output includes ""red."" Each instance of ""wif"" is matched with a ""red,"" but when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" there is not just one, but multiple ""red"" in a sequence.
- Similarly, ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" with multiplicities of ""green"" following a ""walm.""
- The word ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue,"" and ""zup"" is linked to ""yellow,"" with sequences of these colors in the presence of ""walm.""

From the examples given, it seems that ""walm"" induces a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule:
walm -> triggers repetition of the color associated with the word that comes before ""walm."" The number of repetitions corresponds to the number of letters in the word that precedes ""walm."" 

Here's the breakdown:
- ""wif"" has three letters, and after ""walm,"" it produces three ""red.""
- ""lug"" has three letters, resulting in three ""blue.""
- ""dax"" has three letters, hence three ""green.""
- ""zup"" has three letters, resulting in three ""yellow.""

Putting it succinctly:
walm -> causes the preceding color word to be output as many times as there are letters in the word that precedes ""walm.""",1.0,95,walm
"Based on the context provided, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"" from the patterns in the inputs and outputs.

Looking at all the examples and focusing on the occurrences of ""walm"" and their respective outputs:

- In the first example, ""walm"" results in three occurrences of the color green.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax wif bluf dax"" and the output associated with ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue green.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" alone results in three occurrences of the color yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" following ""zup lug"" leads to ""blue blue blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" following ""zup wif"" leads to ""red red red.""

From this, we can infer that ""walm"" has an effect on the next word or sequence of identical words. The output pattern appears to repeat the color associated with the word following ""walm"" three times. If there is no word following ""walm,"" as seen in the third example, the color repeats the word preceding it. This pattern holds true regardless of which color word (e.g., red, green, blue, yellow) follows ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the next word's color to be repeated three times in the output. If ""walm"" is the last word, the output repeats the color associated with the word before ""walm"" three times.

Hence, we can write:

walm -> repeats the next color word's associated color three times in the output or, if at the end, repeats the previous color word's associated color three times.",0.9,95,walm
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,96,lug
"Rule: lug -> blue. The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in all provided examples.",1.0,96,lug
"Rule: lug means ""blue."" Each occurrence of the word ""lug"" in the input corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,96,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's analyze the patterns of input and corresponding output:

- In example 1, the input ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" which repeats the word blue three times. Therefore, ""lug"" may be related to the repetition of the word that follows it or could specifically translate to ""blue.""

- In example 2, the presence of ""lug"" still outputs ""blue"" despite other words being in the sequence.

- In example 3, the input ""lug"" by itself still turns into ""blue.""

- Example 4 also confirms that ""lug walm"" repeats the blue three times, reinforcing the initial observation.

- Example 5 shows ""lug zup"" resulting in ""blue yellow,"" displaying a consistent translation of ""lug"" to ""blue,"" but no repetition like in the ""lug walm"" case.

Taking all these examples into account, the instances of ""lug"" consistently result in the word ""blue,"" independent of the context. The additional repetition of ""blue"" when ""walm"" follows ""lug"" seems to be a special case related to the specific combination of words.

"Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Each time ""dax"" is mentioned in an input, it is translated to ""green"" in the output. Additionally, it seems that other nonce words correspond to different colors as follows:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""walm"" results in repeating the color mentioned immediately before it.

So: dax -> green.",1.0,96,dax

- walm -> green

Therefore, when ""dax"" appears, it is translated to the color green, and it maintains this meaning regardless of its position or the other words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,96,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's a breakdown of the examples:

- In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the output is ""green green,"" suggesting ""bluf"" causes ""dax"" (green) to repeat.
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the output is ""red red,"" again suggesting that ""bluf"" causes ""wif"" (red) to repeat.
- In ""dax bluf zup,"" the ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green green yellow."" The ""green green"" comes from ""dax bluf,"" and ""yellow"" corresponds to ""zup.""
- In ""zup wif dax wif bluf,"" each word translates to a color, and ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is ""red,"" resulting in ""red red"" at the end.
- In ""wif lug bluf wif zup,"" we again see that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and is repeated with ""bluf"" to become ""red red"" following the ""blue"" for ""lug.""

"Rule: The word ""bluf"" duplicates the color output of the word that precedes it.

- ""dax bluf"" resulting in ""green green"" shows that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" duplicates this color, resulting in ""green green.""
- ""wif bluf"" becoming ""red red"" indicates that ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it.
- ""dax bluf zup"" outputs ""green green yellow,"" maintaining the pattern where ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""bluf"" duplicates the prior word's color, and ""zup"" introduces a new color, ""yellow.""
- ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" produces ""yellow red green red red,"" which is consistent with the established patterns of each non-""bluf"" word's color and ""bluf"" duplicating the color of the word right before it.
- ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" gives ""red blue blue red yellow,"" which further confirms the consistency of ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup"" to their colors, and ""bluf"" continuing to duplicate the color of the preceding word.

2. ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red,"" which could imply that ""bluf"" means ""red"" when following ""wif.""
3. ""dax bluf zup"" outputs ""green green yellow,"" reaffirming that in the context of ""dax,"" ""bluf"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" is an unrelated ""yellow.""
4. ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow red green red red,"" hinting at the following:

   - ""wif"" is ""red.""
   - ""dax"" is ""green.""
   - ""bluf"" following ""wif"" is still ""red"" (and not related to preceding ""dax"" or ""wif"").
5. ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" outputs ""red blue blue red yellow,"" providing a new piece of information:
   - ""lug"" is ""blue.""
   - ""bluf"" after ""lug"" is ""blue.""

From these instances, it appears that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately preceding it. So, if ""bluf"" is used after ""dax,"" it will output ""green,"" and if it's used after ""wif,"" it outputs ""red."" Following ""lug,"" it outputs ""blue.""

- The third example, ""zup"" is introduced and corresponds to yellow, but ""bluf"" still repeats the color of the word before it (""dax""), hence ""green green yellow"".
- The fourth example demonstrates that ""bluf"" applies the rule regardless of the sequence, always repeating the color associated with the word before it.
- The fifth example confirms the pattern, with ""bluf"" repeating the color of ""lug"", and since ""lug"" has not appeared before, we can infer its associated color is blue.",1.0,96,bluf
"Observing the given examples, the output for ""bluf"" is always repeated twice, and its color output directly corresponds to the color output of the immediately preceding word. Let's analyze each example.

1. Input: dax bluf

2. Input: wif bluf

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word twice.",1.0,96,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" changes the color of the following words to match the color of the word that precedes ""walm"". For instance, after ""walm"" is introduced, the color names that follow replicate the color of the word just before ""walm"". Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, after ""walm"" is said, the color that follows is ""red"", which corresponds to ""lug"", the word that precedes the first ""walm"". The same pattern applies to the second ""walm"", where ""zup"" (yellow) was the word before it.
- In the second example, ""dax"" (green) precedes ""walm"", and so ""green"" is repeated three times after ""walm"".
- In the third example, ""zup"" (yellow) precedes ""walm"", so ""yellow"" follows for the next three words.
- In the fourth example, without any word after ""walm"", it still repeats the color of the word before it, which is ""zup"" (yellow) three times.
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" (blue) precedes ""walm"", so ""blue"" is repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the succeeding color names to replicate the color of the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> changes the color of the following words to match the color of the word that precedes ""walm"".",1.0,96,walm
"To decipher the meaning of ""walm,"" we can examine the output colors for the sequences in each example that include ""walm."" By identifying a pattern in the examples provided, we are able to ascertain the rule governing the color associated with ""walm."" 

- In the first example, the presence of ""walm"" results in repetitions of the color that preceded it.
- In the second example, after ""dax"" (which converts to green), the word ""walm"" causes the repetition of green, and finally, a ""zup"" turns the sequence to yellow.
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which converts to yellow) and leads to a repetition of yellow.
- The fourth example shows that ""zup walm"" becomes a triple yellow, indicating repetition after ""zup.""
- In the final example, ""lug walm"" turns into triple blue, indicating that the pattern holds.

If we apply these observations to each instance, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the previous word. If the previous word translates to a particular color, ""walm"" causes the next outputs to repeat that color until a new word introduces a different color.",1.0,96,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's observe the pattern:

- When the nonce word ""walm"" follows another word, the output color is the same as the color associated with the word it follows, but with one additional repeat of that color. This can be seen in examples where ""walm"" is not the first word.

For instance:
1. ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" which is one more ""blue"" than ""lug"" by itself would produce.
2. ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" which is one more ""green"" than ""dax"" by itself would produce.
3. ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which is one more ""yellow"" than ""zup"" by itself would produce.

- When ""walm"" is the first word in the sequence, the three colors that follow are all identical to the color that would be associated with the second word if ""walm"" were not present.

For instance:
1. ""walm lug zup walm"" leads to ""red red red blue yellow yellow yellow,"" implying that ""red"" was the color for ""lug"" in the context following ""walm,"" and ""walm"" afterward causes the repetition of ""yellow"" from ""zup.""

Based on this pattern, the rule for the word ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes repetition of the color associated with the word that follows it, with the output showing three instances of that color. If ""walm"" is followed by another ""walm,"" it repeats the pattern established by the preceding color.

Therefore, the meaning seems to be:

walm -> Causes the color of the word that follows it to repeat three times. If ""walm"" follows another word, it results in that word’s color repeating one extra time.",0.9,96,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", let's examine the colors associated with different words and the repetition patterns in the outputs.

Observing the examples:

1. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" and ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow"":
   - ""dax"" -> ""green""
   - ""wif"" -> ""red""
   - ""lug"" -> ""blue""
   - ""zup"" -> ""yellow""

2. ""dax walm zup"" and ""green green green yellow"":
   - ""dax"" -> ""green""
   - ""zup"" -> ""yellow""

3. ""zup walm lug wif"" and ""yellow yellow yellow blue red"":
   - ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" -> ""blue""
   - ""wif"" -> ""red""

4. ""zup walm"" and ""yellow yellow yellow"":
   - ""zup"" -> ""yellow""

5. ""lug walm dax"" and ""blue blue blue green"":
   - ""lug"" -> ""blue""
   - ""dax"" -> ""green""

From these observations, we can note that when ""walm"" is used after any word, the output color for that previous word is repeated an additional two times before showing the color associated with ""walm"" itself. For instance:

- ""walm"" following ""dax"" (which is ""green"") results in ""green green green"" (3x green).
- ""walm"" following ""zup"" (which is ""yellow"") results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" (3x yellow).
- ""walm"" following ""lug"" (which is ""blue"") results in ""blue blue blue"" (3x blue).

The repetition suggests that ""walm"" acts as an intensifier or duplicator of the color associated with the previous word.

Rule:
walm -> When following another word, it causes the color associated with that word to be repeated two additional times before the next color is introduced. If ""walm"" is the last word or follows a series of itself, the associated color is output three times.",0.9,96,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples and their corresponding outputs.

When we look at the inputs and outputs, we notice that the word after ""walm"" dictates the color repeated three times in the output.

- In example 1, after walm is ""lug"" and ""zup"" which correspond to ""red red red"" and ""yellow yellow yellow"" in the output.
- In example 2, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" in the input, and we see ""green green green"" before ""yellow"" in the output.
- In example 3, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" which corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"" before ""blue"" in the output.
- In example 4, there's no word after ""walm,"" but the output contains ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- In example 5, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""blue blue blue"" before ""green"" in the output.

From these examples, it seems that the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the color associated with the following word to be repeated three times in the output. If there is no word following ""walm,"" then ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

So the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: When ""walm"" precedes a word, the output will have the color corresponding to that word repeated three times. If ""walm"" is the last word or it is not directly followed by another color-indicating word, the default color repeated three times is yellow.

Therefore:

walm -> Repeats the color of the following word three times in the output, or defaults to yellow if no word follows.",0.8,96,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.",1.0,97,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Every time ""lug"" is mentioned in the input, the output is ""blue.""",1.0,97,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,97,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Hence, the rule is:

lug -> blue

Meaning: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,97,lug
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following associations for each word:

- wif -> red
- bluf -> red
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> yellow (note: ""walm"" appears twice in a row in the last input but corresponds to ""blue blue"" in the output; this could indicate an error or a contextual rule that isn't immediately clear from the examples)
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

Given these associations and the consistent output for ""lug"" across different examples, we can infer:

Rule: lug -> blue",0.9,97,lug
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green."" 

This rule is consistent across all examples where ""dax"" is present. The output is always ""green"" irrespective of other words (like ""lug"" or ""walm"") in the input.",1.0,97,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Based on the given examples, every instance of the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" Regardless of the context or surrounding words in the input, ""dax"" translates to ""green"" in the output.",1.0,97,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" is output. There is no example in which ""dax"" leads to a different output; thus the rule seems to be that ""dax"" consistently means ""green"".",1.0,97,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each time the word ""dax"" is featured alone as an input, the output is ""green"". Therefore, it seems reasonable to deduce that the standalone word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". However, when ""dax"" is combined with other words like ""lug"" and ""wif,"" it is associated with additional colors, suggesting that other words also represent different colors and the position of ""dax"" in the sequence does not seem to affect its meaning. ""Lug"" appears to be associated with ""blue"", and ""wif"" with ""red"".

Rule: 
dax -> green",1.0,97,dax
"Based on the information provided in the examples, we can observe a consistent pattern that associates the word ""dax"" with a certain color. Each instance where ""dax"" is mentioned, regardless of the other words around it, the output includes the color green. The other words in the examples (""lug"" and ""wif"") correspond to other colors, and these colors are consistent regardless of the presence of ""dax.""

From the examples given:

- When ""dax"" is presented alone, the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is presented after ""lug,"" the output sequence includes ""blue"" followed by ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is presented after ""lug walm,"" the output sequence is ""blue blue blue green.""

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: dax -> green. The meaning of ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color green, irrespective of its position or the other words present.",1.0,97,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to discover the pattern governing the use of the nonce word ""wif."" It appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" consistently across the examples. However, its position in the input phrase does not seem to be tied to a specific position in the output sequence (end or middle), but rather ""wif"" seems to cause the color red to follow the last mentioned color(s) associated with other non-wif words.

For instance:
- In ""zup wif zup dax,"" ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"" (yellow) and then ""dax"" (green), so the sequence is ""yellow red yellow green.""
- In ""lug walm wif bluf,"" ""wif"" is preceded by ""lug"" and ""walm"" (both blue) and followed by ""bluf,"" and the sequence is ""blue blue blue red red.""

It suggests that ""wif"" is not just directly translated to ""red,"" but it may denote a 'separator' or a 'marker' that indicates the end of a sequence before it, or an introduction of red as a repeating color following the sequence of colors mentioned before it in the list. 

However, in the interest of sticking to the simplest consistent rule that the examples allow, I will not over-interpret the function of ""wif"" beyond its consistent translation. In all examples, ""wif"" introduces the color ""red"" sooner or later.

Thus, the rule seems to be:

wif -> red",1.0,97,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the term ""wif"" seems to consistently correspond to the color red in the output. Each example contains the nonce word ""wif,"" and regardless of its position in the input sequence, the output always includes the color red.

Additionally, the presence of different words before ""wif"" produces different colors. ""Zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" also maps to ""blue."" These mappings remain consistent, with ""wif"" consistently following with ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule can be deduced as: wif -> red.",1.0,97,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

Each instance of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red"" in the output. This is consistent across all provided examples.",1.0,97,wif
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the output. It seems that ""wif"" is consistently represented as ""red"" regardless of its position in the input string. Thus, it can be concluded that ""wif"" translates to the color red in this context.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,97,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. In each instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, the output includes the color red at the position where ""wif"" would correspond. Additionally, the examples show that other nonce words translate into other colors. Using this pattern, we can deduce the following:

- ""lug"" always corresponds to blue.
- ""dax"" always corresponds to green.
- ""zup"" always corresponds to yellow.
- ""bluf"" seems to be a combination of ""blue"" and ""red"" thus corresponding to blue followed by red in the output.
- ""walm"" corresponds to two instances of blue.

Given this, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be:

Rule: ""wif"" -> red",1.0,97,wif
"Based on the examples provided where the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" the rule seems to be consistent:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow in each context it appears.",1.0,97,zup
"Based on the examples provided, each input word seems to correspond to a specific color in the output. The word 'zup' consistently corresponds to the color 'yellow' in the output. The other words in the inputs ('wif,' 'bluf,' 'dax,' 'walm,' 'lug') each correspond to their own colors as well. We know this because 'wif' always results in 'red,' 'lug' always results in 'blue,' and so on, regardless of their position in the input.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that 'zup' corresponds specifically to the color 'yellow' without dependency on context or position within the sequence of words.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,97,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output. This pattern holds true across multiple examples, regardless of the placement of ""zup"" or the other words present.

Thus, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,97,zup
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. The other words in the input seem to correspond to other colors:

- ""wif"" -> red
- ""bluf"" -> yellow

"zup -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, zup consistently translates to the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,97,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided. Let's correlate each instance of ""bluf"" with its output in each example.

- In the first example, the output sequence corresponding to ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" is ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue."" The word ""bluf"" first occurs after ""dax"" (green) but before ""wif"" (red) and corresponds to the second ""green"" in the output. The second ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" (yellow) and before ""lug"" (blue) and corresponds to the second ""yellow.""

- In the second example, ""dax lug bluf wif"" corresponds to ""green blue blue red,"" and ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" (blue) and corresponds to the second ""blue"" in the output.

- In the third example, ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow,"" and ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and corresponds to the second ""yellow"" in the output.

- In the fourth example, ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue,"" and ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and corresponds to the second ""yellow"" in the output.

- In the fifth example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red red,"" and ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red) and corresponds to the second ""red"" in the output.

From these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that directly precedes it. In each instance, the output color for ""bluf"" matches the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word.",1.0,97,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> yellow

Based on the examples provided, each instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""yellow"". There is a direct mapping between this nonce word and the color, independent of the other words in the sequence.",1.0,97,bluf
"bluf -> repeat the color of the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a word, the output color is a repeat of the color assigned to the word before ""bluf"". 

For example:
- ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow"", as ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is repeated due to ""bluf.""
- ""lug bluf wif"" leads to ""blue blue red,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and is repeated because of ""bluf,"" followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red.""",1.0,97,bluf
"Based on the examples given, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be that it corresponds to the color of the word that directly proceeds it in the sequence. Let's confirm this observation with each input/output pair:

1. ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug""
    - Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
    - Here, the first ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" itself is matched with green. The second ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is yellow, and ""bluf"" is output as yellow.

2. ""dax lug bluf wif""
    - Output: green blue blue red
    - ""Bluf"" comes after ""lug"" which is blue, and ""bluf"" outputs as blue.

3. ""zup bluf""
    - Output: yellow yellow
    - ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is yellow, and ""bluf"" also outputs yellow.

4. ""zup lug zup bluf lug""
    - Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
    - ""Bluf"" follows the second ""zup"" which is yellow, and ""bluf"" outputs as yellow.

5. ""lug walm wif bluf""
    - Output: blue blue blue red red
    - ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is blue, and ""bluf"" outputs as red, contradicting our initial observation. However, this might be a special case since ""bluf"" is the last word, and no word follows it.

Considering the anomaly in the fifth example, I will refine the rule to include that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the preceding word unless it is the last word in the sequence, in which case it outputs as red. However, there isn't enough information to confidently assert that this is consistently the case for when ""bluf"" is the last word, as we only have one such example.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word, or red if ""bluf"" is the last word in the sequence.",0.8,97,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"". The output for ""bluf"" is consistently ""yellow"" in the given examples, regardless of its position in the input string.",0.0,97,bluf
"walm -> meaning. 

To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs with their respective outputs to identify the patterns that could define the rule for ""walm.""

- Every occurrence of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
- Every occurrence of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
- Every occurrence of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
- Every occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

Looking at the patterns:

- In the first example, after ""walm,"" there's a sequence of ""dax lug"" which corresponds to ""green blue"" in the output, but we see ""blue blue"" instead, implying that ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color blue.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by the end of the sequence, and we see ""green green"" in the output which matches the color of ""dax"" before ""walm,"" suggesting that ""walm"" again is causing a repetition.
- In the third example, ""walm"" is again followed by the end of the sequence, and we see ""blue blue"" which is a repetition of the color corresponding to ""lug"" before ""walm.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and there's a repetition of ""red red red,"" corresponding to the color of ""wif.""
- In the last example, ""lug zup walm lug"" corresponds to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" which once more suggests that ""walm"" is causing the repetition of the color matching the word before it, except when followed by the actual word that triggers the color repetition (e.g., ""lug"").

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word directly preceding it to repeat until another word of a different color association appears or the sequence ends.",1.0,97,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns on a per-input basis and the corresponding outputs.

Input 1: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output 1: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Input 2: lug zup dax walm
Output 2: blue yellow green green green

Input 3: zup lug walm
Output 3: yellow blue blue blue

Input 4: lug wif walm
Output 4: blue red red red

Input 5: lug zup walm lug
Output 5: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Analyzing the patterns, we see that the output for ""lug"" is consistently ""blue,"" and the output for ""zup"" is consistently ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" appears at different positions within the input sequences, and its presence seems associated with repetitions of the color immediately before it.

This suggests a pattern where ""walm"" affects the previous color word such that the color repeats in the output.

Let's test this rule against the examples:

- In Input 1, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), and then we get a repetition of blue in the output.
- In Input 2, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), and we see a repetition of green after that in the output.
- In Input 3, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), which leads to repeats of blue in the output.
- In Input 4, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), and the output shows repeated red.
- In Input 5, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), and yellow is repeated in the output following ""walm.""

The Rule:

walm -> causes the color word immediately before it to repeat in the output.",1.0,97,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the word preceding it.

In the examples given, when 'walm' appears, the output color is repeated as many times as the instance of 'walm'. The color to be repeated is the one that corresponds to the preceding word.

For instance:
- In the first example, ""lug walm dax lug"" results in ""blue blue blue green blue."" Here, 'walm' follows 'lug', which corresponds to the color blue. The color blue is then repeated twice, as per the rule, for the single instance of 'walm'.
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" 'Walm' follows 'dax', which corresponds to the color green, and green is repeated twice for the single instance of 'walm'.
- In the third example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" 'Walm' follows 'lug', therefore the color blue is repeated twice for the single instance of 'walm'.
- In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red."" 'Walm' follows 'wif', and the color red is repeated twice as there is one instance of 'walm'.
- In the fifth example, ""zup walm lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" 'Walm' follows 'zup', so yellow is repeated twice for that single instance of 'walm', and then the final 'lug' translates to blue.

Hence, the rule can be summarized that 'walm' causes the color of the preceding word to be outputted twice more.",1.0,97,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the pattern between the inputs and outputs.

1. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue 
2. lug zup dax walm              -> blue yellow green green green
3. zup lug walm                  -> yellow blue blue blue
4. lug wif walm                  -> blue red red red
5. lug zup walm lug              -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Looking at the patterns, it appears that each word corresponds to a color. We can see that ""walm"" seems to be affecting the color before it, as if it indicates a repetition of the color that came before it. For example:

- In example 1, “walm” comes after ""lug"", which is blue, and then the output is blue twice more.
- In example 2, “walm” again follows ""dax"" which is green, and the output is green twice more.
- In example 3, “walm” follows ""lug"" (blue) and the output is blue two more times.
- In example 4, “walm” follows ""wif"" (red) and the output is red two more times.
- In example 5, “walm” follows ""zup"" (yellow) and the output is yellow two times, and similarly ""lug"" (blue) is repeated at the end after the previous ""walm.""

Thus, the rule seems to be: ""walm"" makes the color before it repeat two more times.

Rule: walm -> causes the previous color to repeat two more times.",1.0,97,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for consistent patterns across the examples:

1. In every output where ""walm"" is present, a sequence of the same color follows.
2. The color after ""walm"" matches the color that was assigned to ""lug.""

Based on this pattern, it seems that ""walm"" may cause the color of ""lug"" (which is blue) to repeat a certain number of times. 

Rule:
walm -> causes the next color to repeat a number of times based on previous sequence; the repeated color is the color that corresponds to ""lug,"" which is blue.",0.9,97,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue."" Therefore, the rule is as follows:

"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" represents the color blue in all the given examples.",1.0,98,lug
"Rule: dax -> green.

Backing up this rule, we can see that every time the word ""dax"" is used in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding output:

- In ""zup wif dax,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""wif dax lug dax"" translates to ""red green blue green,"" with both instances of ""dax"" corresponding to ""green.""
- In ""wif dax zup bluf,"" ""dax"" once again corresponds to ""green.""
- ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" includes ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" within a longer sequence.
- Finally, ""wif walm dax zup"" has ""dax"" translating to ""green.""

It's also worth noting that other words seem to have consistent translations as well, like ""wif"" to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" However, since the task is only to deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" the rule above is given for that term only.",1.0,98,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" takes the meaning of a specific color depending on its position relative to other words. To determine the rule, we will analyze the output for each occurrence of ""dax"":

1. When ""dax"" appears after ""zup,"" the color is green.
2. When ""dax"" appears after ""wif,"" the color is green.
3. When ""dax"" appears after ""lug,"" the color is green.
4. Regardless of the word preceding ""dax,"" the color is always green.

After this analysis, we can conclude that the word ""dax"" consistently represents the color green, regardless of the context in which it is used. Therefore, our rule is:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,98,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the correspondence between the inputs containing the word ""dax"" and their respective outputs:

1. zup wif dax -> yellow red green
2. wif dax lug dax -> red green blue green
3. wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow
4. zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green yellow red
5. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow

Now, let's look for patterns, focusing on occurrences of ""dax"" and what follows in the output:

- When ""dax"" follows ""wif"" (as in the first three inputs), the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""green"" (this happens in the second input).
- ""Dax"" does not occur alone in these examples; it is always surrounded by other words.

Based on these observations, we could infer that ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" as it consistently corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of the words that come before it.

Rule: dax -> ""green""",1.0,98,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" observe the context in which it appears and the corresponding output:

- In the first example, ""dax"" directly follows ""wif"" and corresponds to ""green"".
- In the second example, ""dax"" appears twice, both times directly following different words (""wif"" and ""lug"") and corresponds to ""green"".
- In the third example, ""dax"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to ""green"" once again.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" directly follows ""wif"" and corresponds to ""green"".
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" directly follows ""walm"", which is a nonce word, but it corresponds to ""green"" again after ""wif"".

In each instance, irrespective of the word that precedes ""dax"", the corresponding output is ""green"". Thus, it can be deduced that ""dax"" itself is associated with the color ""green"". There is no visible dependency on the preceding word for the translation of ""dax"".

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,98,dax
"Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Here is the pattern that can be observed:

- **First Example:** ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""
- **Second Example:** ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" repeats as ""green.""

Therefore, ""wif"" means ""red"".",1.0,98,wif
"Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Other words seem to correspond to other colors; for example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" to ""blue,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"" while ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" When ""wif"" is mentioned multiple times in the input, ""red"" is repeated in the output for each occurrence. The same pattern follows for other words and their corresponding colors.

Here is the rule derived from the examples:

Rule:
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> blue
- lug -> blue (Note: ""lug"" is mentioned twice and ""blue"" is repeated twice following it in the fifth example.)
- dax -> green
- walm -> yellow (deduced from the fifth example, where it appears once and is followed by ""yellow"" in the output)",1.0,98,wif
"From the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates directly to the color ""red."" The other words in the inputs correspond to different colors in the output. The pattern for these other words is consistent: ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" always to ""blue,"" and so on.

Rule:
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> yellow

The rule for ""wif"" is consistent across all examples: whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.",1.0,98,wif
"Based on the input-output pairs provided, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" There are no counterexamples given to indicate any other meaning for ""wif,"" so from the provided examples, we can induce the rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,98,wif
"Rule:
- **wif** -> red
- Each given word corresponds to a unique color.
- **zup** -> yellow
- **bluf** -> blue

The repeated use of wif always results in red, with no indication that it can mean anything else. The context does not appear to affect the color associated with wif.",1.0,98,wif
"zup -> yellow. Rule: The word zup corresponds to the color yellow. Each occurrence of a word in an input sequence corresponds to a specific color in the output.

When multiple instances of a color word follow ""zup,"" that color is repeated for each instance.",1.0,98,zup
"zup -> yellow.

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of context. Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. Other words may correspond to other colors, and the number of times they appear affects the number of color words in the output.",1.0,98,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the output, regardless of the position it appears in the input sequence.",1.0,98,zup
"zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow every time it appears.",1.0,98,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems consistent, it always translates to ""blue."" When ""bluf"" is presented in a sequence with other words, it does not seem to affect or be affected by the surrounding words, maintaining its translation regardless of position or adjacency to other terms. These other terms (""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""wif"") consistently translate to other colors (""blue,"" ""green,"" ""yellow,"" ""red"" respectively).

Rule: bluf -> blue",1.0,98,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns within the given examples.

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue green green.""
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
3. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
4. In all cases, the word after ""bluf"" (if there is one) is the same color as the word before ""bluf.""

So it seems like ""bluf"" leads to the repetition of the color that directly precedes it. Therefore, ""bluf"" appears to be an instruction to repeat the color of the preceding word in the output.

bluf -> meaning. Rule: Repeat the color associated with the word that comes directly before ""bluf"" in the sequence.",0.9,98,bluf
Rule: bluf -> blue.,0.4,98,bluf
"bluf -> green

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color green.",0.0,98,bluf
"Upon examining the inputs and outputs, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates to a specific color. The output is a sequence of colors and each color corresponds to an input word. It does not seem to depend on the context or position within the sequence, as each instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to the same output color regardless of other surrounding words.

By aligning each instance of ""bluf"" with its corresponding output across the provided examples:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is associated with the color ""green"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is again associated with the color ""green"".
- In the third example, the position of ""bluf"" between two ""zup""s (which correspond to ""yellow"") does not affect its output, which remains ""green"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is still associated with ""green"".
- In the fifth example, even when ""bluf"" is surrounded by different words (""dax"" and ""lug"", which correspond to ""green"" and ""blue""), its output remains ""green"".

The input ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green"", regardless of the other words in the sequence. Thus, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: bluf -> green",0.0,98,bluf
"walm -> meaning. Rule: The word ""walm"" results in the output of three consecutive colors, with the specific color being the one that follows the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""walm"". 

Analyses of Examples:
1. In ""dax zup walm wif walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and therefore ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". Following that, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, so the second ""walm"" results in ""red red red"".

2. In ""zup wif walm lug"", ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, so ""walm"" here results in ""red red red"". ""lug"" afterwards results in a blue.

3. In ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""walm"" means ""blue blue blue"". The ""dax wif bluf dax"" sequence is just a sequence of colors following their corresponding words without ""walm"" being involved.

4. In ""lug walm zup wif"", ""lug"" leads to ""blue"", so ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"". After ""walm"", the sequence continues normally with ""zup"" as yellow and ""wif"" as red.

5. In ""dax wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to red, which makes ""walm"" result in ""red red red"". ""dax"" at the beginning is just green by itself.

Therefore, the rule seems to be the repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"", three times.",1.0,98,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" affects the color following it. Specifically, it seems to cause the next word to produce three instances of its corresponding color output. To verify, we will analyze the given examples:

1. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" correlates with ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red"". The word ""walm"" after ""zup"" yields three ""yellow"" and after ""wif"" yields three ""red"".

2. ""zup wif walm lug"" correlates with ""yellow red red red blue"". The presence of ""walm"" after ""wif"" produces three ""red"" outcomes.

3. ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" correlates with ""green blue blue blue green red red green"". After ""lug"", ""walm"" leads to three ""blue"", and ""dax"" after ""walm"" does not repeat since it is the start of a new sequence.

4. ""lug walm zup wif"" correlates with ""blue blue blue yellow red"". Again, ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" results in three ""blue"", and the sequence continues normally with ""zup"" and ""wif"" afterwards without additional repetition.

5. ""dax wif walm"" correlates with ""green red red red"". The pattern holds with ""walm"" after ""wif"" causing three ""red"".

From these examples, we can deduce the rule associated with ""walm"" in this context:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the next word to have its associated color output repeated three times.

Therefore:

walm -> Causes the next word's color to be produced three times.",1.0,98,walm
"Analyzing the input-output pairs, we see that ""walm"" consistently results in multiple ""red"" outputs. More specifically, each instance of ""walm"" is followed by three reds in the output, regardless of the preceding word. No other input word corresponds to red in any other context, suggesting that the word ""walm"" is directly responsible for the red outputs that follow it. Here is a summary of the observations:

1. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   
2. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   
3. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   
4. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   
5. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

In every instance, ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of three reds. Based on this pattern, we can deduce the rule for ""walm.""

walm -> meaning: When ""walm"" appears in the input, it produces three ""red"" outputs.

Rule: Whenever ""walm"" is present in the input, output three ""red"" colors in sequence.",1.0,98,walm
"Based on the examples given, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond to a sequence of the color ""red"" repeated three times in the output. Each instance of ""walm"" in the input results in ""red red red"" in the output, regardless of the other words surrounding it.

Rule: walm -> red red red",1.0,98,walm
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be that when it is said once, it translates to two instances of the color red in the output. When ""walm"" is repeated once immediately after another ""walm,"" the output is a continuation of red but with an additional red for each subsequent ""walm.""

Here are the observations leading to this conclusion:

- When ""walm"" appears once (Examples 2, 4, and 5), it is followed by ""red red"" in the output.
- When ""walm"" appears twice in succession (Example 1), it is followed by ""red red red"" in the output, which suggests an additional ""red"" for the repeated ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule might be:

Rule: walm -> meaning: When ""walm"" is mentioned, it means ""red"" is repeated in the output once more than the number of consecutive ""walm"" instances.

Applying the rule consistently:

- In Example 1 (""dax zup walm wif walm""), the two consecutive ""walm""s result in three ""red"" in the output.
- In Example 3 (""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax""), there is only one ""walm"" which is not directly followed by another ""walm,"" hence it results in two ""red"".

Based on this consistent application, the deduced meaning is:

walm -> meaning: ""red"" is repeated in the output once more than the number of consecutive ""walm"" instances present.",0.9,98,walm

"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in all provided examples.",1.0,99,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" can be deduced by comparing the input sequences with their corresponding outputs.

1. In ""lug zup dax zup,"" given the output ""blue yellow green yellow,"" we can see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. An instance of ""dax"" on its own has the output ""green.""

3. In ""dax walm wif walm,"" the output ""green green green red red red"" suggests a pattern. Since we know ""dax"" is ""green,"" it appears that ""walm"" is repeated three times, possibly corresponding to the three instances of ""green"" after ""dax,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to the three instances of ""red.""

4. Again, a single instance of ""dax"" results in the output ""green.""

5. Finally, in ""lug dax zup lug wif,"" the output ""blue green yellow blue red"" confirms previous deductions: ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""

"Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the occurrences of the word ""zup"" correspond to the color ""yellow."" Here is how this rule applies to each example:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Based on the above analysis, the rule is:

"zup -> yellow

"zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,99,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the outputs corresponding to each occurrence of ""bluf"", looking for patterns that could suggest its meaning or the rule governing its translation.

Let's take a look at where ""bluf"" appears and the color output directly linked to it:

3. wif bluf dax bluf wif -> red red green green red
4. dax bluf -> green green
5. zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

By examining these examples, ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output. It doesn't seem to depend on the word that comes before or after it. Therefore, the rule is likely as simple as a direct translation:

bluf -> green

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output regardless of its position in the input string.",1.0,99,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green."" 

Thus, bluf -> green.",1.0,99,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can look at the consistent pattern in each example.

1. Every time the word ""bluf"" appears, the output color is ""green"".
2. ""bluf"" doesn't seem to have a positional effect (i.e., its position in the sequence doesn't change the color it's associated with).
3. ""bluf"" corresponds to the same output regardless of the surrounding words.

Given these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> green",1.0,99,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe that every time the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. There are no instances where ""bluf"" corresponds to any other color in the output. Therefore, we can deduce that the word ""bluf"" represents the color ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> green",1.0,99,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> green

The word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color green in all of the given examples.",1.0,99,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let us examine the patterns associated with the word in the given examples:

- In the first example, ""walm"" appears twice, and the corresponding output colors are ""red"" each time it appears.

- In the second example, ""walm"" appears once and is again followed by ""red.""

- In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by three ""red.""

- In the fourth example, ""walm"" precedes two yellow and is followed by one ""red,"" with ""wif"" appearing before and after ""walm,"" corresponding to ""red"" each time.

- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by two ""blue,"" with ""zup"" appearing before ""walm"" and corresponding to ""yellow.""

Looking at these patterns, we note that ""walm"" is consistently followed by one ""red"" in the output. The color before ""walm"" seems to depend on the preceding word, not ""walm"" itself. Therefore, we can deduce:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the next color in the sequence to be red.",1.0,99,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we will analyze the patterns in the given examples. We notice that each instance of ""walm"" in the inputs corresponds to a sequence of ""red"" in the outputs. The pattern suggests that ""walm"" triggers the color ""red"" to be repeated in the output.

Furthermore, we can observe that the number of ""red"" that appear in the output is directly affected by previous words. For each unique word that has appeared before ""walm"" in the input, a ""red"" appears in the output. 

For example:

- In the first input, ""dax zup walm wif walm,"" there were three unique words before the first ""walm"" (""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""wif"") resulting in three ""red"" following it. The last ""walm"" has no unique words before it, so it does not add any additional ""red"" outputs.
- In the second input, ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" there are four unique words (""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf""), so a sequence of four ""red"" appears after ""walm.""
- The third input, ""lug wif zup wif walm,"" contains three unique words before ""walm"" (""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""zup""), and similarly, we get three ""red"" after ""walm.""

Based on the above observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be a repetition of the color ""red"" in the output equal to the count of unique words preceding it in the input.

Rule: ""walm"" -> The word ""walm"" causes the output to contain a sequence of ""red"" equal to the number of unique words that have appeared before it in the input sequence.",1.0,99,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the given input-output pairs and identify any patterns associated with the word ""walm."" We will look for repetitions and how the presence of ""walm"" in the input affects the colors in the output.

- Input: dax zup walm wif walm -> Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
- Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
- Input: lug wif zup wif walm -> Output: blue red yellow red red red
- Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug -> Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
- Input: zup dax lug walm zup -> Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

Focusing on where ""walm"" appears, let's note the color before and after it:

1. Before the first ""walm"" appears and after every occurrence of ""walm,"" the color ""yellow"" appears in the first instance, and the color ""red"" appears after each ""walm"" and any subsequent ""walm.""
2. There are instances where ""walm"" is directly followed by another ""walm"" (as in the first example), where the color right after ""walm"" is ""yellow"" once, followed by ""red"" twice, suggesting an increment in the number of ""red"" occurrences corresponding to the number of ""walm"" occurrences.

Based on this pattern, ""walm"" seems to induce a shift in the output sequence: It turns the next color into ""yellow"" upon the first occurrence and into ""red"" for its occurrence as well as any consecutive ""walm"" occurrences. However, it may also be true that ""walm"" acts as a reset for a color sequence, with ""yellow"" indicating the start of a new sequence followed by ""red(s)"". There isn't enough context in the examples to firmly conclude what the starting or reset color is.

Considering this information, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" occurs in the input, it causes the next color in the output to be ""yellow"" if it's the first occurrence, and any further sequential occurrence of ""walm"" results in ""red"" colors being produced.

So, the rule for walm is:

walm -> The first occurrence causes the next color in the sequence to be ""yellow,"" and subsequent consecutive occurrences produce ""red"" colors.",0.8,99,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. When ""walm"" appears once in the input (e.g., Examples 1, 2, 3), it corresponds to a series of three ""red"" in the output. 
2. When ""walm"" is absent (e.g., there is no such example provided, but it's notable because its presence seems necessary for the rule induction), the sequence of three ""red"" does not appear in the output.
3. The word before ""walm"" (wif, bluf, lug) has no effect on the appearance of the ""red"" sequence since ""walm"" is the consistent trigger.
4. When ""walm"" is followed by another word (e.g., Example 4), the output sequence contains additional colors, corresponding to other words, yet the three ""red"" still follow the occurrence of ""walm"".
5. When ""walm"" comes after a sequence of other words (e.g., zup, dax, lug), it results in duplicating the color represented by the word right before ""walm"" in the output (e.g., in Example 5, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and after ""walm"" there are additional ""blue"").

From these observations, we can infer:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. Meaning: the presence of ""walm"" in the input triggers the output of three occurrences of ""red"". Additionally, if there is a word appearing directly after ""walm,"" it seems to cause a duplication effect for the color corresponding to the word before ""walm.""

Meaning: When ""walm"" appears in the input, it causes the word directly preceding it to replicate its corresponding color in the output, followed by a sequence of three ""red"". If ""walm"" is the last word or is followed by another ""walm,"" the sequence of three ""red"" appears without duplication.",0.8,99,walm
"To induce the rule for the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine each input in relation to its corresponding output.

1. dax zup walm wif walm -> green yellow yellow yellow red red red
2. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red
3. lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red
4. wif lug zup walm wif lug -> red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
5. zup dax lug walm zup -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow

To identify the meaning of ""walm,"" let's start by taking each example containing ""walm"" and looking for patterns in the outputs.

For example 1: After the first occurrence of ""walm,"" all the output colors are red.
For example 2: Again, after ""walm,"" the output colors are red.
For example 3: Following ""walm,"" the output consists of reds as well.
For example 4: ""walm"" is followed by a series of yellow before the second ""walm,"" after which it turns to red.
For example 5: ""walm"" is followed by blue outputs.

Looking at examples 4 and 5, we can notice that ""walm"" seems to change the output sequence into a single repeating color, but the color following ""walm"" may change depending on the context.

Taking a closer look, we can observe the output before the appearance of ""walm"":
- Example 1 has ""yellow"" before two ""walms,"" both followed by ""red.""
- Example 2 has a mix of colors but ends with ""yellow"" before ""walm,"" followed by ""red.""
- Example 3 has ""red"" before ""walm,"" followed by ""red.""
- Example 4 has ""yellow"" before ""walm,"" followed by ""yellow,"" then ""red"" after the second ""walm.""
- Example 5 has ""blue"" before ""walm,"" and the output is ""blue"" after ""walm.""

Based on these observations, we can formulate a hypothesis:
""walm"" causes the following outputs to repeat the color of the output that precedes ""walm.""

So if we recheck the examples with this hypothetical rule:

1. The output before the first ""walm"" is yellow, so we get repeating yellows, then the output before the second ""walm"" is yellow, and it repeats reds.
2. The output before ""walm"" is yellow, resulting in repeating reds.
3. The output before ""walm"" is red, resulting in repeating reds.
4. The output before the first ""walm"" is yellow, resulting in repeating yellows, before the second ""walm"" is yellow, resulting in repeating reds.
5. The output before ""walm"" is blue, resulting in repeating blues.

However, this hypothesis does not fit perfectly with example 5, where ""blue"" is followed by ""blue,"" while in the other examples the color changes after ""walm."" It may be that in example 5 the rule is overridden by a prior rule involving ""lug,"" as seen in the presence of consecutive blues in the output.

Therefore, considering the majority of the cases, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the next outputs to switch to the color of the output directly before ""walm"" until another ""walm"" appears or the end of the sequence is reached.",0.8,99,walm

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the output ""yellow."" Regardless of its position within the input sequence or the surrounding words, ""zup"" always results in the color ""yellow"" in the output. The presence of ""zup"" does not seem to affect the translation of the other words, as they consistently map to the same color each time they appear.

Thus, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,100,zup
"Based on the given examples, we'll look for patterns that lead us to the meaning of the word ""zup."" We'll examine the output following each occurrence of ""zup"" to try and find any consistencies.

1. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
2. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
3. wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
4. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
5. wif dax zup -> red green yellow

Considering the outputs, the word ""zup"" always seems to be followed by at least one ""yellow"" in the output. Additionally, the examples provided do not offer any instance where ""zup"" is not followed by the output ""yellow,"" nor do they present any case where ""zup"" is involved in producing a color other than ""yellow."" 

Additionally, it does not seem that ""zup"" directly influences the colors that come before it, as evidenced by varied outputs that precede ""yellow"" after the word ""zup"" is used in the examples. Additionally, in the fourth example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" which seems to produce only the color ""yellow""; this rules out the possibility that ""zup"" affects the following word to consistently output one ""yellow.""

Based on the above observations:

Rule: zup -> yellow (The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.)",1.0,100,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,100,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to induce the rule by looking at the correspondence between the input and the output words and their colors.

- For the first and second instances of ""zup"" (in the first and second examples), it corresponds to ""yellow yellow"".
- In the third example, there are two instances of ""zup"", each again corresponding to ""yellow yellow"".
- The fourth example has a single ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- The fifth example has ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"".

There appears to be a consistent association between the nonce word ""zup"" and the color yellow. However, the number of yellows that follow ""zup"" are not consistent. In the first three sentences, ""zup"" is followed by two yellows, while in the fourth, ""zup"" is followed by three yellows, and in the fifth, there's only one yellow.

In an attempt to find a pattern, one could suggest that ""zup"" generates an output of at least one yellow and possibly more depending on other words or context in the sentence. However, without a clear pattern on when ""zup"" results in one, two, or more yellows, the rule cannot be definitively concluded for the quantity. For this reason, the rule will focus on the association of ""zup"" with the color yellow, not the number of times it appears.

Rule: zup -> corresponds to the color yellow.",0.9,100,zup
"Based on the examples:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""

Analyzing the instances where ""bluf"" appears:

1. ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red."" In this case, ""bluf"" translates to ""red"", the same as ""wif.""
2. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue green green."" Here, ""bluf"" translates to ""green,"" which is the same as the preceding ""dax.""
3. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue."" In this instance, ""bluf"" translates to ""blue,"" following the same color as the preceding word ""lug.""
4. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""green red yellow yellow red red red."" Here, ""bluf"" is translated to ""yellow,"" the same color as the preceding word ""zup.""
5. ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" translates to ""green yellow red red blue."" Again, ""bluf"" takes on the color red, the same as the preceding word ""wif.""

The rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word preceding it. 

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,100,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the outputs for each instance where it appears:

1. Input: dax wif bluf -> Output: green red red
2. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf -> Output: blue red blue green green
3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
4. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
5. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug -> Output: green yellow red red blue

Now let's try to identify the pattern:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""

Every time ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""red"" precedes it, and following it, the output is the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""red"" and ""bluf"". For instance:

- In example 1: dax (green) wif (red) bluf -> green red red
- In example 2: lug (blue) dax (green) bluf -> blue green green
- In example 5: dax (green) zup (yellow) wif (red) bluf lug (blue) -> green yellow red red blue

From the above observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" results in repeating the color that is associated with the word that appears just before ""wif"" (which itself translates to ""red""). This rule holds true in all the given examples.

Rule: bluf -> the output is the color corresponding to the word prior to ""wif"" adjacent to ""bluf.""",1.0,100,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the output colors that correspond to its position in each example. Notice that every time ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Now let's examine the position of ""green"" in the output compared to other words:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" directly follows ""dax wif,"" and the output for these words is ""green red red."" Since ""bluf"" corresponds to the first ""green,"" it could be related to the word ""dax"" or the entire sequence ""dax wif.""

- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug dax,"" and the output is ""blue red blue green green."" The ""green"" corresponding to ""bluf"" follows the sequence ""lug dax.""

- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug,"" with the output sequence around it being ""yellow yellow blue."" Here again, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" immediately after ""zup.""

- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is between ""zup"" and ""wif,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow green red red red.""

- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is between ""wif"" and ""lug,"" and the output is ""red red green blue.""

Given these observations, the common rule is that ""bluf"" always corresponds to ""green,"" regardless of the words that precede or follow it. Therefore, the rule associated with ""bluf"" is that it corresponds to the color ""green"" every time it appears in the input.

Rule: bluf -> green.",1.0,100,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word translates to a specific color. To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can look for the common color in every output that follows it.

1. dax wif bluf -> green red red
2. lug wif lug dax bluf -> blue red blue green green
3. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
4. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red
5. dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue

From these examples, we can observe that after the word ""bluf,"" the color that appears is ""red."" However, in the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""green."" This discrepancy suggests either the rule has been incorrectly described in that instance, or the color that ""bluf"" represents changes depending on context. To determine the rule, ignoring the exception for now, we would infer:

bluf -> red

However, the exception in the second example is notable. Given that it's the only example where two colors appear after ""bluf,"" it's plausible that ""bluf"" indicates a transition or repetition of previous colors, making ""green"" a resulting color rather than part of the rule for ""bluf.""

In attempt to reconcile the second example, let's consider the possibility that it's the combination ""dax bluf"" that means ""green red"" rather than ""bluf"" alone. But this theory isn't supported by the fourth example where ""dax wif zup bluf"" translates to ""green red yellow yellow red red red,"" since following the previous logic, it would've included green after ""bluf.""

As it's not conclusive and the majority of examples indicate ""bluf"" translates to ""red,"" the inferred rule, unless given further data or context, will remain:

bluf -> red",0.8,100,bluf
"Analyzing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" can be deduced as follows:

- Every time ""bluf"" is mentioned in the input, the corresponding output color is ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
- However, we also notice that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" and appears in the output immediately before the instances of ""red"" that correspond to ""bluf."" Hence, ""dax"" is not causing the ""red.""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red"" as well, but since ""bluf"" also results in ""red,"" there must be another association that ""bluf"" has, which is not immediately clear from the output alone.
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" we can assume translates to ""red"" due to its outputs when in sequence.

Looking at the structure, it seems like ""bluf"" results in ""red"" and potentially terminates the sequence, causing every word after ""bluf"" to also translate to ""red"" until a new sequence begins or the sequence is terminated. This is observed by the repetition of the ""red"" output after ""bluf"" appears, even for words that would otherwise translate to a different color (""walm"" which singly generates ""red"" doesn't repeat but extends the sequence of ""red"" after ""bluf"").

"Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the color word that precedes it.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue,"" which again shows that ""walm"" causes the preceding color (""blue"") to repeat three times.
- In the third example, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" results in ""green green green red blue green green green,"" which reinforces the rule, as ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) both times, causing ""green"" to be repeated three times each time it appears.
- In the fourth example, ""zup wif walm"" turns into ""yellow red red red."" Here ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), resulting in ""red"" being repeated three times.

"Based on the given examples, we can make the following observations about the word 'wif' and its relationship with the outputs provided:

1. Every time the input 'wif' appears at the beginning of the sequence, the corresponding output is 'red'.
2. This correspondence seems consistent regardless of what follows 'wif' in the sequence.
3. The word 'wif' does not appear to change meaning based on context - it consistently maps to 'red'.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

"Based on the given examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word 'zup' seems to be consistent. Here is the rule induction based on each example:

- In the first example, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' since the pattern of the output colors follows the input words until 'zup' is encountered, which corresponds to 'yellow'.
- In the second example, 'zup' still translates to 'yellow' in the output, confirming its consistency from the previous example.
- In the third example, 'zup' is again followed by 'yellow' in the output.
- The fourth example has 'zup' followed by 'yellow' without any other data interfering, suggesting that 'zup' has a standalone meaning of 'yellow'.
- The fifth example provides further support as 'zup' is again translated to 'yellow' when the order of words is reversed.

Inductively, the rule for the nonce word 'zup' can be formulated as:

Rule: 'zup' -> 'yellow'",1.0,101,zup

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" is consistently translated to the color ""yellow"" in each example, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,101,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" it seems we should look at the relationship between its position in the input and the corresponding words in the output. Here is the breakdown of the inputs and outputs:

1. ""dax bluf zup"" -> ""green green yellow""
2. ""zup lug bluf wif"" -> ""yellow blue blue red""
3. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
4. ""lug bluf wif"" -> ""blue blue red""
5. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""

Looking at these pairs:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output color is ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output color is ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output color is ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output color is ""red.""

The pattern indicates that the word ""bluf"" causes the output to be the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. The rule is that ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word and repeats it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""bluf"".",1.0,101,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the correspondence between the input and the output in each example:

Input: dax bluf zup

Input: zup lug bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue red

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Input: lug bluf wif

Based on these examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" causes the output color to repeat the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. In each instance, the color that is associated with ""bluf"" in the output is the same as the color associated with the word right before it.

So, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color associated with the preceding word in the sequence.

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning is to repeat the color of the word that comes before it.",1.0,101,bluf
"bluf -> repeats the color associated with the previous word. Rule: When bluf follows a word, it takes on the color associated with that word. If no word comes before bluf, the default association appears to be red.",1.0,101,bluf
"Rule: The word bluf corresponds to the color that is the output of the word that immediately precedes it.

Evidence:

- When ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""green green"", suggesting ""bluf"" means the same color as ""dax"" (green).
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow"", suggesting ""bluf"" means the same color as ""zup"" (yellow).
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""blue blue"", suggesting ""bluf"" means the same color as ""lug"" (blue).
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""red red"", suggesting ""bluf"" means the same color as ""wif"" (red).

Therefore,

bluf -> The color that corresponds to the word immediately before it.",1.0,101,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to mirror the color associated with the word that precedes it when the output is a sequence of colors. Here are the specific observations:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" that follows it also corresponds to green.
- In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""bluf"" that follows immediately also corresponds to blue.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" again corresponds to blue, and ""bluf"" that follows it also corresponds to blue.

The third and fifth examples don't provide a preceding word for ""bluf,"" but the output color is simply repeated from ""wif -> red"" and ""zup -> yellow"" respectively.

Given this pattern, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word that comes before it in the sequence; if ""bluf"" is the first word in the sequence or there are no preceding words with assigned colors, then the output is the color associated with ""bluf.""

Thus,

bluf -> The color of the word that precedes it. If bluf is the first or only word, the output is red for ""wif bluf"" or yellow for ""zup bluf"".",0.8,101,bluf
"Rule: The word ""walm"" appears to indicate a repetition of the colour previously mentioned three times. If a colour has not been specified before ""walm,"" it defaults to yellow.

Here's the breakdown:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is a repetition of ""blue"" three times, since ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" 
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is a repetition of ""yellow"" three times, as ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is a repetition of ""green"" three times, as ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is a repetition of ""red"" three times, as ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

In the case where ""walm"" is immediately preceded by another nonce word that translates to a colour, the output is the translation of that nonce word repeated three times. If ""walm"" follows ""zup"" with no colour word in between, it defaults to three repetitions of ""yellow.""

Therefore: walm -> Repeats the colour of the preceding word three times. If no colour precedes it or if ""zup"" is the preceding word, the repeated colour is yellow.",1.0,101,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to extend the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Each input starts with one word which on its own translates to a single color, and then ""walm"" follows, resulting in the repetition of the preceding color in the output. 

The rules seem to be as follows:

- The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue.
- The word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow.
- The word ""dax"" translates to the color green.
- The word ""wif"" translates to the color red.

When ""walm"" follows any of these words, the output color is repeated three times. Note, this repetition rule seems to be overridden if another color word is introduced after ""walm"", in which case the new sequence begins with the new color and the new repetition sequence follows that color.

Thus:
walm -> Repeats the color of the word before it three times. (Except when followed by another color word, which initiates its own sequence.)

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the preceding color three times in the output.",1.0,101,walm
"Rule: The word 'walm' seems to correspond with a series of the same color that follows a color represented by another word. For example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting that 'walm' repeats the color blue three times. Here are the breakdowns:

- In ""lug walm zup lug walm,"" 'lug' is blue and 'zup' is yellow. 'Walm' after 'lug' generates a sequence of three blues, and after 'zup', a sequence of three yellows is generated, but it is interrupted by another 'lug' (blue).

- In ""zup walm,"" 'zup' translates to yellow, and 'walm' leads to three yellows.

- In ""zup dax walm,"" 'dax' introduces a new color, green, and 'walm' repeats the green three times.

- In ""zup wif walm,"" 'wif' introduces red, and 'walm' repeats the red three times.

- In ""lug dax zup dax walm wif,"" the pattern holds with the repetition of the color that precedes 'walm' (green in this case), and 'wif' at the end introduces one red without repetition, as 'walm' had already set the prior pattern for green.

Based on these observations, it can be concluded:

walm -> 'walm' means to repeat the color that precedes it three times.",1.0,101,walm
Rule: walm -> repeats the last color mentioned three times.,1.0,101,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's look at the correspondences between the inputs and outputs:

1. ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue""
2. ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow""
3. ""zup dax walm"" corresponds to ""yellow green green green""
4. ""zup wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red red red""
5. ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" corresponds to ""blue green yellow green green green red""

From these examples, we can glean the following information regarding the number of times colors are repeated:

- ""walm"" alone appears to repeat the color indicated by the previous word three times. This is evident in examples 2, 3, and 4.
- When ""walm"" comes after two different words (as in example 5), the pattern seems consistent: the color associated with the word directly preceding ""walm"" repeats three times, and then the color sequence switches to another one (the sequence associated with ""wif"").

Now let's construct a rule based on these observations:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to repeat three times.

With this rule, we can extend the input-output relationship:

1. ""lug walm"" - ""lug"" gives ""blue,"" then ""walm"" repeats this color three times to give ""blue blue blue.""
2. ""zup walm"" - ""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" then ""walm"" repeats this color three times to give ""yellow yellow yellow.""
3. ""zup dax walm"" - ""dax"" gives ""green,"" then ""walm"" repeats this color three times to give ""green green green"" after the preceding ""yellow.""
4. ""zup wif walm"" - ""wif"" gives ""red,"" then ""walm"" repeats this color three times to give ""red red red"" after the preceding ""yellow.""

"To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""lug,"" let's analyze the outputs corresponding to different configurations of input including the nonce word and other recurring words. By examining the sequence of inputs and their respective outputs, we can look for patterns that may reveal the meaning of ""lug.""

In the provided examples, ""lug"" consistently correlates to the color ""blue"" in the output:

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green
Here, ""lug"" is followed by ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" 

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
Here, ""lug"" is followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red.""

Input: lug wif
Output: blue red
Again, ""lug"" leads and the output for it is ""blue.""

Input: lug dax zup dax wif
Output: blue green yellow green red
Here, ""lug"" is at the beginning, and the output starts with ""blue.""

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
In this example, ""lug"" follows ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Based on the patterns observed in all examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: lug -> blue

This suggests that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,102,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.",1.0,102,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.",1.0,102,lug
"Based on the provided examples, ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue"". The other words in the inputs change their corresponding colors in the outputs, depending on their position or the presence of other words. However, ""lug"" always results in ""blue"" regardless of its position or the other words present.

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,102,lug

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position within the sequence or the other words present. Therefore, the rule can be stated as: 

dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" consistently means ""green"".",1.0,102,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" is associated with the color red. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding output. The color following ""wif"" appears to correspond to the next word in the input sentence.

Here is the rule considering the above observations:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,102,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". In each case where ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding output.

Therefore, the rule is:
wif -> red",1.0,102,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can see that each time the word ""wif"" is used, it translates to ""red"" in the output. The translation is consistent regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence or the words surrounding it. Therefore, the rule induced from the examples is that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,102,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer that ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color, as each instance of ""wif"" results in the word ""red"" in the output. No context is provided that would suggest ""wif"" changes meaning depending on its position in the sentence or its surrounding words. Therefore, the rule appears to be consistent across all examples.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,102,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" seems to consistently correspond with the color ""red"". Each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the output at the exact position where ""wif"" is located in the input. The other words, ""dax"", ""lug"", ""zup"", and ""walm"", are associated with the colors ""green"", ""blue"", ""yellow"", and ""red"" respectively, but ""walm"" results in ""red"" repeated for each subsequent position in the string after it first appears.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red",1.0,102,wif
"From the examples provided, it is clear that each word corresponds to a specific color. The words ""wif,"" ""walm,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" correspond to the colors red, red, green, and blue, respectively. The nonce word ""zup"" appears to consistently correspond to the color yellow.

Here is the breakdown of each example:

1. wif zup walm dax zup -> red yellow red red green yellow
2. zup wif -> yellow red
3. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
4. zup lug walm wif walm -> yellow blue red red red red red
5. lug dax zup -> blue green yellow

In all instances, regardless of position or surrounding words, ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow. 

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,102,zup
"Based on the examples provided:

- When ""zup"" appears after ""wif"" or ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" appears at the beginning of an input, it also produces ""yellow.""

According to all examples, ""zup"" consistently leads to the output ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, it seems that ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow. ""Zup"" means yellow.",1.0,102,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" correlates with the color 'yellow'. In every instance where ""zup"" is present in the input, the corresponding output includes the color 'yellow'. There seems to be no dependency on the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence nor the context of the surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,102,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can see that the output colors change according to the presence of the word ""zup"" and the words before it. Let's analyze the input-output pairs closely to deduce the rule:

1. The presence of ""wif"" before ""zup"": 
   - In the first example, ""wif zup walm dax zup"" translates to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow."" 
     Here, ""wif"" followed by ""zup"" translates to ""red yellow.""
   - In the second example, ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red."" 
     Here, ""wif"" after ""zup"" translates to ""red,"" but we do not see the color that would directly correspond to ""zup"" when it stands at the beginning.
   - In the third example, ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow.""
     Here, ""zup"" at the end translates to ""yellow,"" following a sequence of ""red"" colors not affected by ""zup.""
   - In the fourth example, ""zup lug walm wif walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue red red red.""
     Here we do not see a direct ""wif""-""zup"" combo, but ""zup"" at the beginning translates to ""yellow.""

2. In every instance where ""zup"" is present, irrespective of its position, the output always contains ""yellow."" This suggests that ""zup"" itself triggers the output ""yellow,"" but its position might influence the preceding or succeeding words.

3. Other color-word associations:
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
   - ""walm"" translates to ""red"" or ""blue,"" depending on its placement relative to ""wif"" or ""lug.""
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

4. No input contains both ""zup"" and ""dax."" It suggests there is no direct rule for the interaction between ""zup"" and ""dax,"" but we do know that ""dax"" independently translates to ""green.""

Note: There seems to be an inconsistency with the output of ""walm."" For instance:

- In ""wif zup walm dax zup,"" ""walm"" outputs ""yellow.""
- In ""zup lug walm wif walm,"" ""walm"" outputs ""red"" after ""wif.""

Since ""walm"" results in different colors, we may conclude that ""walm's"" output might be context-dependent, possibly affected by the words that precede it. However, this puzzle is about ""zup,"" not ""walm.""

From the analysis above, we can write:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",0.9,102,zup
"From the given examples, we can induce the following assignments for the nonce words provided:

- wif -> red
- walm -> red (but notice that in the first example, after a zup it turns to yellow)
- dax -> green (but again, it turns to yellow when following a zup)
- lug -> blue

The word ""zup"" changes the output color of the words that follow it, with one apparent exception (lug, which doesn't change color after ""zup""). Here is the pattern of change once 'zup' is used:

- Walm and dax change to yellow after ""zup"".
- Wif remains red whether it appears before or after ""zup"".
- Lug remains blue whether it appears before or after ""zup"".

On the basis of these observations, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" appears to cause certain words after it to change color to yellow, except for ""lug"" and ""wif"", which retain their original colors.

Rule: zup -> Changes the following words' output to yellow, except for ""lug"" and ""wif"", which retain their original color (blue and red, respectively).",0.8,102,zup
Rule: bluf -> red,0.0,102,bluf

"bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" regardless of position or surrounding words in a sequence.",0.0,102,bluf
"Based on the examples given, it appears that the word ""bluf"" directly translates to the color ""red"" in each instance it is used. It does not seem to depend on context or position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule is:

"bluf -> red

Rule: The word bluf translates to the color red regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it.",0.0,102,bluf
"Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to be an instruction to repeat the previous color word three times.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the previous color word three times.",1.0,102,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the previous color word three times. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""lug"" represents ""blue"", and after ""walm"" we see ""blue blue blue"".
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"", resulting in ""green green green"".
- In the third example, ""lug"" which is ""blue"", is followed by ""walm"", producing ""blue blue blue"".
- In the fourth example, since the order is ""wif walm"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", after ""walm"" we see ""red red red"".
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with ""green"", followed by ""green green green"".

From these observations, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" can be stated as:

Walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: If a color is followed by the word ""walm"", output the name of that color three times consecutively.",1.0,102,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word 'walm' seems to generate a repetition in the output. When 'lug walm' is the input, the 'blue' color is repeated three times. Similarly, when 'zup wif dax walm' is given as input, the last color 'green' is repeated three times, and so on. It appears that 'walm' causes the last mentioned color to be outputted three times in a row.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last color mentioned three times.",1.0,102,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" represents repetition of the color that immediately precedes it in a one-to-one correspondence. Each occurrence of ""walm"" results in the preceding color being repeated three times. Therefore, we can define the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the preceding color name to be output three times. 

For example:
- In ""lug walm,"" lug corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" makes it ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""zup wif dax walm,"" zup is yellow, wif is red, and dax is green, so ""walm"" makes the last color ""green"" repeat three times to become ""green green green.""

Thus, the word ""walm"" -> Repeat the color word that precedes ""walm"" three times.",1.0,102,walm
"Given the examples, it seems like the word ""walm"" has an output that depends on a preceding word. Here's what each preceding word appears to output:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue"" (3 times ""blue"").
- When ""zup"" and ""dax"" precede ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green"" (3 times ""green"").
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red"" (3 times ""red"").

Additionally, when there are other words after ""walm,"" such as in the third and fourth examples, those words also have an output:

- ""bluf"" following ""walm"" leads to ""red red"" (2 times ""red"").

Based on this, it seems that ""walm"" causes the word directly before it to be repeated three times in the output. And if there's a word after ""walm,"" it is repeated two times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word directly preceding ""walm"" three times in the output. If there is a word following ""walm,"" repeat its associated color twice.",0.9,102,walm
"Based on the examples provided, ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule for ""lug"" is as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,103,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples.",1.0,103,lug

Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,103,lug
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" appears to always translate to the color ""green"". No matter where ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output always includes the word ""green"". Here are the translations seen in each example:

1. lug -> blue
2. wif -> red
3. bluf - repeated twice in the output as yellow, despite the different ending lettes from ""wif"" and ""lug"".
4. zup -> yellow

So we can infer the rule that ""dax"" represents the color green, with no dependence on context. It is a static translation.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,103,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's look for patterns related to its use in the input and corresponding output.

1. lug wif dax -> blue red green
2. wif lug dax lug -> red blue green blue
3. lug dax bluf -> blue green green
4. dax zup lug wif lug -> green yellow blue red blue
5. zup bluf wif dax lug -> yellow yellow red green blue

Looking at the examples, whenever ""dax"" appears, ""green"" appears in the output. Additionally, ""dax"" doesn't have a fixed position in the input; it moves around, but ""green"" always appears after the words corresponding to it.

The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" to another ""green.""

Given this information, we can infer that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,103,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the English word ""green."" Here is how that conclusion is reached from each example:

- In the first example, the sequence ""lug wif dax"" translates to ""blue red green."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" the only remaining word to translate is ""dax,"" which must mean ""green.""
- In the second example, ""wif lug dax lug"" translates to ""red blue green blue."" Again, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""dax"" must then be ""green,"" especially since it is surrounded by known words whose meaning is consistent with previous examples.
- The third example, ""lug dax bluf,"" is translated to ""blue green green."" Since ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""dax"" is the next word, it must mean ""green"" to keep the consistency. The word ""bluf"" doesn't seem to influence the meaning of ""dax.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax zup lug wif lug"" translates into ""green yellow blue red blue."" With ""lug"" known as ""blue"" and ""wif"" as ""red,"" and considering the consistency of ""zup"" as ""yellow"" and the position of ""dax"" at the beginning, it remains to mean ""green.""
- The fifth example, ""zup bluf wif dax lug,"" becomes ""yellow yellow red green blue,"" and once more, with ""zup"" as ""yellow,"" ""wif"" as ""red,"" and ""lug"" as ""blue,"" ""dax"" stands out as meaning ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,103,dax
"Reviewing the examples given and the corresponding outputs, it seems that every instance of ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"":

1. lug wif dax -> blue red green
2. wif lug dax lug -> red blue green blue
3. lug dax bluf -> blue green green
4. dax zup lug wif lug -> green yellow blue red blue
5. zup bluf wif dax lug -> yellow yellow red green blue

In each of these translations, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input, it always corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,103,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the translation of each nonce word into a color seems consistent every time a particular word appears. The word 'lug' consistently translates to 'blue,' 'wif' translates to 'red,' 'bluf' translates to 'green,' and 'zup' translates to 'yellow.'

To determine the meaning of 'dax,' let's see how it changes the output in each instance:

1. When 'dax' is introduced after 'lug wif,' the output is 'blue red green.' Since 'lug' corresponds to 'blue' and 'wif' to 'red,' 'dax' appears to result in 'green.'
2. In the second example, 'lug' is followed by 'dax' without any other new word in between, and the output is 'blue' followed by 'green.' This is consistent with the first example.
3. In the third example, 'dax' is followed by 'bluf,' and the output is 'green green.' Since 'bluf' always translates to 'green,' this suggests 'dax' also represents 'green.'
4. In the fourth example, 'dax' is again followed by 'lug,' and the output is 'green blue,' consistent with the previous identifications of 'dax' as 'green' and 'lug' as 'blue.'
5. In the fifth example, 'dax' comes before 'lug,' and the output sequence 'green blue' follows the same pattern, with 'green' corresponding to 'dax' and 'blue' to 'lug.'

From these observations, it seems that 'dax' consistently corresponds to the color 'green.'

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.",1.0,103,wif

- dax -> green

- bluf -> no direct translation given, but it appears in the sequence before ""wif dax wif,"" which maps to ""red green red,"" and given ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" maps to ""yellow yellow red green red yellow,"" it’s possible that bluf maps to another occurrence of yellow, following the pattern.

"Based on the examples given, it is possible to deduce a rule that the word ""walm"" dictates the color of the words that follow it, until a new color word (like ""wif"", ""lug"", or ""zup"") is introduced to reset the color sequence. To clarify, we analyze each input and output pair:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - ""wif"" sets the color to red.
   - ""walm"" maintains the color red for ""dax"".

   - ""lug"" changes the color to blue.
   - ""wif"" changes the color to red, and ""walm"" maintains it for the next ""red"" word.
   - Finally, ""zup"" changes the color to yellow again.

Rule: walm -> maintains the current color until a new color word appears to change the sequence.",1.0,103,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the colors that are output when ""walm"" is present in the input. Here is the breakdown of the provided examples:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup 
   Output: red red red green yellow
   
2. Input: zup walm wif 
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   
3. Input: lug zup dax walm 
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   
4. Input: lug walm zup wif 
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   
5. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup 
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

Let's analyze the patterns:

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the corresponding output color for ""walm"" is red, which is the same as for ""wif.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the corresponding output color for ""walm"" is yellow, which is the same color output for ""zup.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output color for ""walm"" is blue, which is the same color output for ""lug.""
- All these patterns indicate that the color output for ""walm"" is dependent on the word that directly precedes it in the input sequence.

Given these observations, it seems that ""walm"" takes on the output color associated with the immediately preceding word in the input. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as:

Rule: ""walm"" -> The output color for ""walm"" is the same as the output color for the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,103,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the output colors in relation to the input words. The possible influence of each word on the output color needs to be examined in each instance where ""walm"" is used. 

From the examples given, the output color for ""walm"" changes based on the context of its positioning among other words. To figure out the rule, let's focus on the instances of ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""wif walm dax zup"", ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" which yields a red color and is succeeded by ""dax"" and ""zup"" which yield green and yellow, respectively. The output for ""walm"" in this case is red, matching the color of the preceding word ""wif"".
- In the second example, ""zup walm wif"", ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" and both have an output color of yellow. The following word ""wif"" yields red but this does not affect ""walm"" since it comes after it.
- The third example, ""lug zup dax walm,"" presents ""walm"" at the end, following the colors blue, yellow, and green for ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax,"" respectively. However, ""walm"" gets the output of green, which is the color for the preceding word ""dax"".
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm zup wif,"" ""walm"" again takes the color of the preceding word ""lug,"" which is blue.
- Lastly, the fifth example ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" shows ""walm"" twice and both instances the output color matches the preceding word (""wif"" yields red and in both cases ""walm"" is red).

From these observations, it appears that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that comes directly before it in the sequence. 

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the preceding word. If the preceding word is:
- ""wif,"" then walm is red.
- ""lug,"" then walm is blue.
- ""dax,"" then walm is green.
- ""zup,"" then walm is yellow.",1.0,103,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the colors of the outputs in relation to the words in the input. Let's examine the colors that follow ""walm"" in each example:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup | Output: red red red green yellow
2. Input: zup walm wif | Output: yellow yellow yellow red
3. Input: lug zup dax walm | Output: blue yellow green green green
4. Input: lug walm zup wif | Output: blue blue blue yellow red
5. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup | Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

When we look at the outputs following the ""walm"" in the input:

1. After ""walm,"" the color that follows is ""green.""
2. After ""walm,"" the color that follows is ""red.""
3. After ""walm,"" the color that follows is ""green.""
4. After ""walm,"" the color that follows is ""blue.""
5. After the first ""walm,"" the color that follows is ""yellow""; after the second ""walm,"" the color that follows is ""red.""

One consistent rule appears to be that the color that follows ""walm"" is the same as the color that precedes ""walm."" This rule holds up in each example:

1. ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" the output color is ""green,"" which was the color output for ""dax.""
2. ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" the output color is ""red,"" which was the color output for ""wif.""
3. ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" the output color is ""green.""
4. ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" the output color is ""yellow,"" which was the color output for ""zup.""
5. The first ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and after the first ""walm,"" the output color is ""yellow,"" which was the color output for ""zup."" The second ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and after the second ""walm,"" the output color is ""red.""

However, there is an inconsistency in that final point where a second ""walm"" doesn't follow the same rule as the first, but that might be explained by the repetition of patterns in inputs and outputs.

Considering that ""walm"" seems to mimic the color of the word following it, ""walm"" might mean ""copy"" or ""repeat.""

Rule: walm -> ""repeat the color of the next word.""",0.8,103,walm
"Observing the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or the rule associated with the nonce word ""walm"" by looking for patterns that correlate with the color outputs. 

Here are the given inputs and outputs:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup  
   Output: red red red green yellow

2. Input: zup walm wif  
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red

3. Input: lug zup dax walm  
   Output: blue yellow green green green

4. Input: lug walm zup wif  
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red

5. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup  
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

From these, we can try to figure out what ""walm"" contributes to the pattern.

- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""dax"" resulting in the output ""red red red green yellow"".
- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the result is ""yellow yellow yellow red"". It's notable that ""wif"" which follows ""walm"" results in ""red"".
- In example 3, ""walm"" is the last word, and all words ending in ""green"".
- In example 4, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", and all outputs are ""blue"" up to ""walm"", after which the pattern changes.
- In example 5, the sequence ""wif walm zup"" appears twice, with the outputs ""red red red yellow"" each time.

From these observations, it seems like ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it, until a new word starts a new color sequence. So, if we have to deduce a rule, it can be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat the color of the previous word, until a new input word changes the sequence.

Therefore:

"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rules:

When 'dax' is accompanied by 'wif', 'red' is added to the output:

dax wif -> green red

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,104,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Here is how the rule applies for each example:

- ""zup dax wif"" translates to ""yellow green red."" Whenever ""zup"" and ""dax"" are mentioned in the input, they correspond to ""yellow"" and ""green,"" respectively, and when ""wif"" is mentioned, it corresponds to ""red.""

- ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" translates to ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Again, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

- ""dax wif zup dax"" translates to ""green red yellow green."" Although the other words change position, ""wif"" remains consistently translated to ""red.""

- ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue."" Even when ""wif"" comes first, it translates to ""red.""

Rule:

1. Whenever ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""
2. Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
3. Whenever ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue.""
4. The word ""wif"" is always translated to ""red"" in the output.

By looking at the examples, we see that each input word has a corresponding color in the output. Since ""wif"" consistently results in ""red,"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words, we can deduce that ""wif"" means ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,104,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Therefore, the rule induced from the examples is:

"Rule: zup corresponds to the word ""yellow."" 

Evidence:

- Consistently, every instance of the word ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"" in the output, irrespective of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.
- Other words in the sequence correspond to different colors, and their translation does not alter the translation of ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Hence, zup -> yellow.",1.0,104,zup

Rule: Each instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,104,zup
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns in the inputs and outputs:

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red

Input: dax bluf lug wif
Output: green green blue red

It appears that ""bluf"" corresponds consistently to the output color ""blue.""

For confirmation:
- In the first example, ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""zup"" and ""lug,"" which correspond to ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" respectively. ""Bluf"" itself generates ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" appears at the end, following ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and it still generates ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, there are only three colors and ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and is still ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and it again corresponds to ""blue.""

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:
bluf -> blue",1.0,104,bluf
"bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue.",1.0,104,bluf

- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is blue.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is red.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is green.

Therefore, ""bluf"" could represent a chameleon-like color that changes based on a preceding condition given by the preceding word:

Rule: bluf -> The color that ""bluf"" represents changes based on the word that comes before it:
- ""zup"" before ""bluf"" means the color is yellow.
- ""lug"" before ""bluf"" means the color is blue.
- ""wif"" before ""bluf"" means the color is red.
- ""dax"" before ""bluf"" means the color is green.",1.0,104,bluf
"From examining the examples provided, each instance where the word ""bluf"" appears corresponds to the output ""blue"".

Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red

Input: dax bluf lug wif
Output: green green blue red

As seen in the examples, regardless of position or surrounding words, ""bluf"" always aligns with the output ""blue."" Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> blue",1.0,104,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" based on the examples provided, let's look at the correspondence of each word to a color in the output.

Analyzing the outputs, we can see the following patterns:

- ""zup"" always corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" always corresponds to the color ""blue"".
- ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red"".
- ""walm"" corresponds to either ""yellow"" or ""red"" depending on its position (appears to result in ""red"" when following ""wif"" or ""bluf"").
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".

The word ""bluf"" appears to be directly followed by the color ""blue"" in every output except for when it is preceded by ""dax"", in which case it is immediately followed by the color ""green"" the same as ""dax"". Interestingly, when ""bluf"" appears it also seems to influence the color that comes after it. If the output pattern is observed closely, ""bluf"" tends to change the subsequent output sequence. For example, when followed by ""lug"" or ""wif"", the color ""blue"" or ""red"" respectively repeats.

Given these observations, we suspect that ""bluf"" has a behavior of inducing repetition in the output color of the following word, except when it follows ""dax,"" in which case it takes on the color green just like ""dax."" However, since we have only one instance of ""dax"" preceding ""bluf,"" we should be careful about drawing strong conclusions from this single instance. The direct and consistent relationship is that ""bluf"" has caused a repetition of the color associated with the following word or influenced the pattern in its context.

To summarize the initial observation:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is present in the input, the color associated with the following word is repeated in the output, with the exception when ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" as it results in the color green which is also associated with ""dax"".",0.8,104,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine each input and its respective output, focusing on the occurrence of ""walm"" and its effect on the output sequence.

1. Input: lug walm dax 
   Output: blue blue blue green
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" is situated between ""blue"" and ""green."" Based on this example alone, we can't deduce the exact meaning of ""walm.""

2. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   Here, we know ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" After two ""wif""s (red red), ""walm"" is introduced and followed by ""lug"" (blue), which suggests ""walm"" might be related to a transition to ""blue"".

3. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" Here, ""walm"" appears twice; each time, it transitions the output sequence from ""green"" to ""green."" This doesn't give us additional insight into its meaning, as it's not altering the output from the preceding color.

4. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green
   ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" Following ""dax,"" ""walm"" results in two ""green"" outputs, which matches what we've previously seen with ""green"" following ""dax.""

5. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the sequence here does not change the output color after ""walm.""

By observing the patterns, ""walm"" appears to cause repetition of the output color that directly precedes it. ""walm"" does not introduce a new color but rather repeats the last color mentioned before it.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" means to repeat the output color that comes before it.
",1.0,104,walm
"Assessing the given examples:

- Input: lug walm dax
  Output: blue blue blue green

- Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
  Output: red red green green red red red blue red

- Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
  Output: green green green red blue green green green

- Input: zup dax walm
  Output: yellow green green green

- Input: wif walm
  Output: red red red

From the inputs and outputs, we notice that the presence of the word ""walm"" results in the word ""green"" being repeated multiple times in the output immediately after its occurrence. The number of green outputs seems to correspond to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence. To verify this, let's look at the examples:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" is the second word, and there are two ""green"" outputs following it.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" is the sixth word, and there are exactly six ""red"" outputs before it, followed by a single ""blue"" output corresponding to ""walm"".
3. The third example has ""walm"" as the second and sixth words. Each ""walm"" has two and three ""green"" outputs following it, corresponding to its position.
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" is the third word, and there are three ""green"" outputs following it.
5. Lastly, in the fifth example, ""walm"" is the second word, and there are two ""green"" outputs following it.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" translates to the word ""green"" being outputted as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" outputs the word ""green"" repeated as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.",1.0,104,walm
"Based on the given examples, walm seems to be associated with the color that immediately follows its mention. Each time ""walm"" is used in the input, the corresponding output color is repeated one more time than its appearance in the input. Here's the breakdown of the usage:

- Input: lug walm dax - Output: blue blue blue green
  (Walm is preceded by ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, and ""blue"" is then repeated twice to follow ""walm"", resulting in three instances of ""blue"" before ""green"" which corresponds to ""dax"".)

- Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif - Output: red red green green red red red blue red
  (Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" follows after ""wif."" Note that we have an extra ""red"" after the last ""walm"".)
  
- Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm - Output: green green green red blue green green green
  (The two instances for ""walm"" are followed by repetitions of ""green"", the color corresponding to ""dax"", and ""blue"", the color corresponding to ""lug"".)

- Input: zup dax walm - Output: yellow green green green
  (Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and we have an extra ""green"" in the output.)

- Input: wif walm - Output: red red red
  (""Walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" resulting in an extra ""red"".)

Therefore, based on the pattern observed:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word an extra time in the output sequence.",0.8,104,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to change its output color each time it appears, cycling through a sequence of colors. However, it does not alter the sequence of colors following it (for example, ""dax walm wif"" produces ""green green green red,"" the same sequence as ""dax wif""). 

To deduce the rule for ""walm,"" let's examine its occurrence and the corresponding color output in each example:

1. lug walm dax -> blue blue green
2. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> red red green red red red blue red
3. dax walm wif lug dax walm -> green green green red blue green green green
4. zup dax walm -> yellow green green green
5. wif walm -> red red red

Let's break down the sequences:

1. Before ""walm"": lug -> blue; After ""walm"": dax -> green
2. Before ""walm"": wif -> red; After ""walm"": lug -> blue
3. Before the first ""walm"": dax -> green; After the first ""walm"": wif -> red; Before the second ""walm"": dax -> green; After the second ""walm"": no color, but previously green was consistently used for ""dax.""
4. Before ""walm"": dax -> green; After ""walm"": no color, but ""dax"" before ""walm"" was green.
5. Before ""walm"": wif -> red; After ""walm"": no color, but previously, ""wif"" was red.

Looking at these sequences, we can possibly deduce that ""walm"" might represent a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. However, the fifth example does not have a word after ""walm"" to compare with, but it is still red, which is the color corresponding to ""wif."" 

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude this:

Rule: The word ""walm"" represents the repetition of the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Meaning: walm -> repetition of the previous color.",0.8,104,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the output is a sequence of colors where each color is determined by an input word. To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's consider the output color that corresponds to each occurrence of ""walm"" in the inputs:

- In the first example, ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" also corresponds to ""blue,"" even when the sequence of previous words is different.
- In the third example, ""walm"" corresponds to ""green,"" but only after ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green"" itself, has occurred in the sequence.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""dax,"" which precedes it, also corresponds to ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" corresponds to ""red,"" which is the same color corresponding to ""wif.""

From these observations, it's not immediately clear what ""walm"" stands for because it seems to correspond to different colors (blue, green, red) under different circumstances. However, if we consider the possibility that ""walm"" might repeat the color of the word directly before it, the outputs make sense:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue.""
- In the second example, ""wif walm lug"" leads to ""red red blue.""
- In the third and fourth examples, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red.""

Thus, a potential rule is that ""walm"" takes the color of the immediately preceding word in the sequence.

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Given this, it's reasonable to deduce that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" consistently. However, the word ""bluf"" seems to produce ""yellow"" only when following ""zup"", which doesn’t follow the general pattern and is likely a mistake as it is inconsistent with the other examples.

"From the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" causes the color word that follows it in the input to be repeated in the output. This pattern is consistent across all given examples. Note that when ""bluf"" is the last 'word' in the input, green is outputted, which might be the default color when there is no word to repeat or to act as a placeholder.

The rule for ""bluf"" could therefore be:

From the first example, it seems ""bluf"" translates to the color ""green.""

In the second example, ""bluf"" is surrounded by other words and still results in ""red,"" but if we look at the pattern, it seems that ""bluf"" results in ""red"" when preceded by ""wif,"" but in this case it is followed by ""zup,"" and it produces ""red"" after ""wif."" This example alone isn't sufficient to derive a firm rule.

The third example shows ""wif bluf"" again translating to ""red red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" next to ""wif"" indeed results in ""red."" However, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output is still ""red"" before ""blue,"" which seems to correspond to ""lug.""

Both the fourth and fifth examples also show that ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green,"" and ""bluf"" after this sequence results in ""green.""

Putting these observations together we can form the following rule:

When ""bluf"" is immediately preceded by ""wif,"" it translates to ""red."" When ""bluf"" appears without ""wif"" immediately before it, it translates to ""green.""

So, the rule is: bluf -> ""green"" by default, but ""red"" if the preceding word is ""wif.""",0.8,105,bluf
"Rule: The term ""bluf"" translates to the output color that is repeated twice in sequence.",0.8,105,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" translates to a particular color in the outputs. To figure out what ""bluf"" means, let's examine where it appears and what color it corresponds to in each output. Here are the occurrences:

1. lug dax bluf -> blue green green
2. zup wif bluf zup lug -> yellow red red yellow blue
3. wif bluf lug dax wif -> red red blue green red
4. wif dax bluf -> red green green
5. wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow

In all instances, the output color associated with ""bluf"" is ""red."" However, in each of these, ""red"" is repeated in the output. This warrants a further look at the condition that might cause ""bluf"" to result in ""red.""

In examples 2, 3, and 4, ""bluf"" is immediately followed by ""lug,"" ""dax,"" or nothing (end of input). In these cases, it appears that ""bluf"" leads to the output ""red."" But in example 1, ""bluf"" is not followed by ""lug"" or ""dax"" and is instead at the end of the input, yielding ""green.""

In example 2, where ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""zup,"" the output is ""red,"" which is consistent with the theory that it behaves as ""red"" when not followed by specific words.

In example 5, where ""bluf"" is the last word following ""zup,"" it results in ""yellow."" But notice that since ""zup"" is represented by ""yellow,"" there might be a rule that when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it repeats the color that ""zup"" represents.

Given that ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" and they do not disrupt the ""red"" output, let's look at a potential rule. It seems that ""bluf"" represents ""red"" except when it is either at the end of the sequence or follows ""zup,"" in which case, it mimics the color of its preceding word or takes a default color at the end of the sequence.

However, there seems to be an inconsistency with example 1, because ""bluf"" is at the end and yields ""green"" even though it should arguably mimic the color before it, which is not the case.

With the given data, the rule is not entirely clear, but we can propose that ""bluf"" generally means ""red,"" with exceptions related to its positioning and neighboring words that we don't have enough data to fully explain.

Rule: bluf -> red (with exceptions based on position and neighboring words).",0.6,105,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeating the color that comes after it.,0.0,105,bluf
Rule: walm -> repeat the last color mentioned one or more times.,1.0,105,walm
Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word in sequence.,1.0,105,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" demonstrates a pattern where it causes the output to repeat the last color mentioned before ""walm"" for the number of times ""walm"" appears. Here's a breakdown:

In the first input, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""green"" repeated three times. 

In the second input, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""red red red green yellow,"" where the ""green"" appears once after ""walm"" showing the repetition of the color associated with ""dax.""

In the third input, ""walm"" is at the end and the output ends with ""yellow"" repeated three times, which is the color associated with ""zup"" that precedes ""walm.""

In the fourth input, ""lug walm wif dax"" leads to ""blue blue blue red green,"" indicating the repetition of the ""blue"" color associated with ""lug"" three times before it moves on to the colors associated with ""wif"" and ""dax.""

In the fifth input, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""red red green green green,"" which shows ""green"" is the color associated with ""dax"" and it is repeated after ""walm.""

Based on this analysis, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the last color mentioned in the output before the appearance of ""walm,"" and repeats that color as many times as ""walm"" appears in sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last color mentioned before ""walm"" in the output for the number of times ""walm"" appears in sequence.",1.0,105,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's analyze the patterns in the outputs in relation to the position and occurrence of the word ""walm"" and other words in the input sequences.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Here, ""dax"" leads to a single ""green"" output, and the subsequent ""walm"" generates two additional ""green"" outputs.

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
Here, ""wif"" leads to a ""red"" output, ""walm"" appears to generate two more ""red"" outputs, followed by one ""green"" (from ""dax""), and finally a ""yellow"" (from ""zup"").

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
Here, ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence and seems to create three repetitions of the previously generated color, ""yellow"" (from ""zup"").

Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the three ""blue"" outputs replicate the color associated with ""lug,"" even before proceeding to ""wif"" and ""dax.""

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
Here, the presence of ""walm"" after ""dax"" again appears to triple the color signified by ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

Considering these patterns, it is reasonable to deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" seems to cause the color output immediately preceding it to be repeated two additional times. 

Thus:

walm -> Repeats the immediately previous color output in the sequence two additional times.",0.8,105,walm
"Examining the outputs associated with the appearance of the word ""walm,"" we can see that ""walm"" consistently corresponds to repeating the color word that follows the word ""dax."" When there is no color word after ""dax,"" ""walm"" is associated with the color ""green,"" which could be considered the default color for this case. Based on the given examples, here is the induction:

Example 1:
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Rule: Since there is no color specified after ""dax,"" the color ""green"" is repeated thrice.

Example 2:
Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
Rule: ""walm"" appears after a color ""red,"" which is repeated three times, followed by the sequence ""green yellow"" associated with ""dax zup.""

Example 3:
Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
Rule: Here, ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence. The last color in the output is ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup,"" and it is repeated thrice.

Example 4:
Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
Rule: When ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" the color ""blue"" gets repeated three times before the sequence continues with ""red green"" for ""wif dax.""

Example 5:
Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
Rule: Again, the output associated with ""walm"" repeats the color ""green"" three times, following ""dax.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be considered as:

Rule: Upon encountering ""walm,"" repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately following ""dax"" three times. If there's no word following ""dax,"" repeat the color ""green"" three times.

Therefore, walm -> Repeat the color word after ""dax"" three times, default to green if none.",0.8,105,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can make the following deductions:

- When ""lug"" appears by itself, the output is ""blue"".
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""wif"", the output is ""blue red"".
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""wif bluf"", the output is ""blue red red"".
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue"".
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm dax"", the output is ""blue blue blue green"".

It seems that ""lug"" translates directly to ""blue"".

Additional conclusions can be drawn about the other words:
- ""wif"" results in the word ""red"".
- ""walm"" translates to a repetition of ""blue"" as many times as there are characters in the word ""walm"" (i.e., ""blue blue blue"").
- ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"".

So, the rule can be summarized as follows:

Rule:
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- walm -> the word ""blue"" repeated for each character in ""walm""
- dax -> green",1.0,106,lug
"lug -> blue. Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue consistently in every instance. Each occurrence of ""lug"" leads to the output ""blue."" ""Wif"" seems to correspond to ""red,"" ""walm"" to a repetition of ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""",1.0,106,lug
"lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue, regardless of the context in which it is used.",1.0,106,lug
"lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of the context in which it appears.",1.0,106,lug
"lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in every given example. The presence of the word ""lug"" directly leads to the output ""blue."" The other words in the examples seem to correlate with other colors, with ""wif"" translating to ""red"" and ""dax"" translating to ""green."" ""Walm"" appears to mean multiple ""blue"" since it leads to ""blue blue blue.""",1.0,106,lug
"Rule: ""dax"" means ""green."" 

This is supported by each instance of ""dax"" in the examples given, translating to ""green"" in the output. For example, in the last input ""dax"" stands alone and translates simply to ""green."" In other instances, ""dax"" is surrounded by other words but consistently translates to ""green.""

Therefore: dax -> green.",1.0,106,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the provided examples and outputs. We'll note the position of ""dax"" in each input and the corresponding output:

1. Input: lug dax wif lug
   Output: blue green red blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" here.

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"" and corresponds to ""green"" again.

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - Here, ""dax"" comes after ""walm"" and before ""zup,"" and once again matches ""green.""

4. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   - Again, ""dax"" is placed between ""wif"" and ""lug,"" and the output is ""green.""

5. Input: dax
   Output: green
   - ""dax"" stands alone and corresponds to ""green.""

From these examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,106,dax
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" 

When examining each input and its corresponding output, we can see that every instance of the word ""dax"" results in the word ""green"" in the output. The surrounding words (lug, wif, zup, bluf, walm) output other colors (blue, red, yellow, etc.), and thus do not affect the output for ""dax.""

So the rule in this case is: dax -> green.",1.0,106,dax
"Observing the given examples, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a color. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green.""

From the provided Input/Output pairs:

- ""lug dax wif lug"" translates to ""blue green red blue,"" where ""dax"" is found between ""lug"" (blue) and ""wif"" (red), and is translated as ""green.""

- ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue blue green blue,"" where ""dax"" appears after ""walm"" and before ""lug,"" resulting in the translation as ""green.""

- ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red green yellow,"" where ""dax"" follows two instances of ""walm"" both translated as ""red"" and comes before ""zup"" (yellow), with ""dax"" translated as ""green.""

- ""wif dax lug walm"" translates to ""red green blue blue blue,"" where ""dax"" follows ""wif"" (red) and precedes ""lug"" (blue), with ""dax"" being translated as ""green.""

- In the example ""dax,"" where it is isolated, it translates directly to ""green.""

Based on these observations, the rule is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,106,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" let's examine its occurrences in the given examples and their respective outputs:

1. Looking at the first example:
   Input: lug dax wif lug
   Output: blue green red blue

   ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" ""Dax"" in this case occurs between ""lug"" and ""wif"" and corresponds to ""green.""

2. In the second example:
   Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   
   ""Dax"" here is placed before ""lug"" and corresponds to ""green"" again. Keeping track of ""lug"" as ""blue,"" ""wif"" as ""red,"" ""zup"" as ""yellow,"" and assuming ""bluf"" and ""walm"" follow a pattern consistent with their respective outputs of ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" ""dax"" continues to be associated with ""green.""

3. For the third example:
   Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

   ""Dax"" follows after ""wif"" and ""walm,"" both corresponding to ""red,"" and precedes ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" with ""dax"" associated here with ""green"" again.

4. In the fourth example:
   Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue

   ""Dax"" follows ""wif"" (red) and precedes ""lug"" (blue), and is represented by ""green"" again.

5. Finally, the fifth example:
   Input: dax
   Output: green

   ""Dax"" is standalone here and directly translates to ""green.""

Combining all the observations, it becomes evident that the word ""dax"" consistently equates to ""green"" irrespective of its position in the sequence or the context provided by the surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green. The meaning is the color ""green"" regardless of its position or contextual usage.",1.0,106,dax
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,106,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" appears to correspond to the color ""red"" in the outputs.

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" can be stated as:
Rule: wif -> red",1.0,106,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the word ""wif"" can be understood as follows:

The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

wif -> red

Rule: When the nonce word ""wif"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""red"" in the output.",1.0,106,wif
"Based on the examples provided, here's the deduction of the meaning of the word ""wif"":

- Every instance of the word ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
- There are no instances where ""wif"" corresponds to any color other than red.
- The color ""red"" only appears in the output when ""wif"" is present in the input.

Given these observations, the rule seems to be:

**wif -> red**

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, output ""red"".",1.0,106,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""",1.0,106,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"", let's examine the patterns from the provided examples. It seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in each example:

- Input: lug zup | Output: blue yellow
- Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax | Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Thus, zup -> yellow.",1.0,106,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we'll examine the provided examples and their outputs, looking for patterns and consistent correlations:

1. Input: zup
   Output: yellow
   - This suggests ""zup"" on its own corresponds to ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - Here, ""zup"" is followed by ""wif walm,"" and it translates to ""yellow"" followed by ""red"" repeated three times. Since we have not seen ""wif"" or ""walm"" individually, we cannot separate their meanings yet.

3. Input: lug zup
   Output: blue yellow
   - ""lug"" precedes ""zup,"" with the output being ""blue"" followed by ""yellow."" This suggests that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and confirms that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   - This combination of words corresponds to three ""yellow"" followed by ""blue yellow,"" and ending with ""red green."" Since ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" it seems like repeating a word could correspond to repeating a color. ""wif dax"" must correspond to ""red green.""

5. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red
   - Like before, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif dax"" to ""red green."" Since the last part of the input is ""wif bluf,"" and the last part of the output is ""red red,"" it would suggest that ""bluf"" means ""red,"" and ""wif"" causes a repetition of the previous color.

Using the patterns and clues found in the provided examples, the meaning of ""zup"" can be inferred consistently:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

So, zup -> yellow.",1.0,106,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that each word corresponds to a specific color.

- zup always corresponds to ""yellow""

- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to no color, since ""wif"" follows it and changes the output.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""walm"" causes the output of red to be repeated three times.

Input: wif walm

- ""walm"" causes red to be repeated three times.

Input: lug zup walm lug
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""walm"" causes yellow to be repeated three times.
- The final ""lug"" is blue.

Input: zup walm dax lug
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""walm"" causes yellow to be repeated three times.
- A color is not assigned to ""dax"", which suggests it does not have an individual corresponding color output here, possibly because of its position after ""walm"".

Input: zup wif walm lug
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""walm"" causes red to be repeated three times.
- The final ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

Based on the pattern in the examples, the rule can be stated as follows:

"Analyzing the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

1. Example: ""zup bluf wif walm""
   Output: ""yellow yellow red red red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" could possibly correspond to another ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" again seems to add additional reds

3. Example: ""lug zup walm lug""
   Output: ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" both at the start and the end
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" seems to repeat the ""yellow"" before it, twice

   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - Again, ""walm"" repeats the ""yellow"" before it, twice
   - ""dax"" potentially corresponds to ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" is following ""wif"" and adding two more ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color output of the word immediately before it, by adding two more of the same color. It does not, however, just repeat the last word said; it specifically repeats the color translated from that word. 

Therefore, the rule can be written as:

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word two times.",1.0,106,walm

3. Input: lug zup walm lug | Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
4. Input: zup walm dax lug | Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
5. Input: zup wif walm lug | Output: yellow red red red blue

From the inputs and outputs, we can observe the following:

- Every time the word ""walm"" is present, the output contains a sequence of the color ""red.""
- The number of times ""red"" is repeated appears to be linked to the presence of other words before ""walm."" In the second example, ""wif walm"" translates to just two ""reds,"" suggesting that ""wif"" turns into ""red"" itself, and ""walm"" adds to it.
- Additionally, ""walm"" seems to turn all preceding words except ""lug"" into ""yellow,"" which is evident from the first, third, fourth, and fifth examples where words preceding ""walm"" are translated to ""yellow.""

The instances of ""walm"" seem to induce the following rule:
- The word ""walm"" causes the preceding words to turn into ""yellow,"" if the word is not ""lug,"" and then adds ""red"" to the output for itself. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" it retains its own color, which is ""blue.""

Therefore, the rules for ""walm"" appear to be:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output.
2. ""Dax"" occurs only once in each of the given examples.
3. The output ""green"" associated with ""dax"" does not seem to depend on the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence.

Given these observations, it is reasonable to deduce that ""dax"" directly translates to the color ""green,"" irrespective of its position in the sequence or surrounding context.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,107,dax
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word 'dax' consistently translates to the color 'green.' Every instance of 'dax' in the input corresponds to 'green' in the output, regardless of its position or the context provided by surrounding words. Here is the rule based on the examples: 

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,107,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to a particular output irrespective of its position in the input sequence. In every case, ""dax"" is translated to ""green"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule is: dax -> green.",1.0,107,dax
"Rule: wif -> red

This rule is supported by the consistent translation of ""wif"" as ""red"" in all provided examples.",1.0,107,wif

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position or the other words present in the input.",1.0,107,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that each nonce word translates to a specific color, and ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" The translations do not appear to be dependent on the position of the word in the sequence. 

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,107,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

Based on the examples provided, each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position, therefore ""wif"" translates to ""red"".",1.0,107,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

First, let's identify the color word present in all the outputs to determine the role of ""wif"":

- lug dax wif → blue green red
- zup dax wif → yellow green red
- dax wif → green red
- dax lug zup wif bluf dax → green blue yellow red red green
- wif lug → red blue

In all instances, regardless of the position or the surrounding words, whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. Moreover, the color ""red"" does not appear in the output unless ""wif"" is in the input. This strictly one-to-one correspondence suggests that ""wif"" directly translates to the color ""red,"" independent of context.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

wif -> red",1.0,107,wif
"According to the examples provided, we can observe the following patterns:

- Whenever we see the word ""zup,"" it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- The word ""bluf"" is associated with the color ""blue"" as well.
- The word ""wif"" and ""walm"" have not been translated alone, but following the pattern, they likely correspond to ""red.""

Given these observations, we can deduce that ""zup"" probably means ""yellow,"" as it consistently maps to ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,107,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string or the other words present.",1.0,107,zup
"Based on the given examples, the meaning of the word ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

Every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the color ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. The presence of ""zup"" does not affect the colors assigned to other words; rather, it consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the presence of other words.

Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" is present in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,107,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

The rule underlying the examples given is that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,107,zup
"Based on the examples provided, zup appears to correspond to the color yellow consistently, regardless of its position in the input sentence. Each occurrence of zup in the input results in yellow appearing in the same position in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,107,zup
"Based on the patterns provided in the examples, we can infer that ""bluf"" correlates to the color blue. Every time ""bluf"" is mentioned, the output includes the word ""blue"" and it appears that the number of times ""blue"" is repeated depends on the presence of other words in the sequence, indicating that those words may change the number of blue instances.

Rule: bluf -> blue (where the repeated instances of ""blue"" in the output may be influenced by other words in the input sequence, but ""bluf"" consistently correlates to at least one instance of the word ""blue"").",1.0,107,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can observe the following:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""yellow"" if it is preceded by ""zup"".
- The output is ""blue"" if ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"".
- The output is ""green"" if ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"".
- The output is ""red"" if ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"".

We can conclude that the word ""bluf"" modifies the color associated with the word that precedes it, essentially doubling the color that would otherwise be outputted by itself. Therefore, the rule seems to be as follows:

Rule: bluf repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Thus, the meaning of ""bluf"" is context-dependent:

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,107,bluf
"bluf -> blue. Rule: When the nonce word ""bluf"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,107,bluf

"bluf -> yellow. The meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be consistent across all the examples, translating to the color yellow every time it appears. Rule: Whenever ""bluf"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow.""",0.0,107,bluf
"Based on the provided input-output pairs, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to correspond to a repetition of the color mentioned immediately before it. More specifically, ""walm"" seems to result in the repetition of the last color word's color, continuing until another color word is mentioned. Here is the pattern as observed:

- ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> The last color before ""walm"" is ""yellow,"" and then ""walm"" results in three more ""yellow.""
- ""dax lug walm"" -> The last color before ""walm"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" results in three more ""blue.""
- ""dax zup dax walm"" -> The last color before ""walm"" is ""green,"" and ""walm"" results in three more ""green.""
- ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" -> The last color before ""walm"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue"" until it is followed by another color word ""zup,"" which changes the color to ""yellow.""
- ""dax walm zup lug walm"" -> The last color before the first ""walm"" is ""green,"" leading to two more ""green"" after ""walm."" Once ""zup"" changes the color to ""yellow,"" after ""lug"" it becomes ""blue,"" and the following ""walm"" leads to two more ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last mentioned color until a new color word appears.",1.0,107,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the word that precedes walm, as many times as the total number of unique words before walm in the sequence.

For example:

- In ""lug wif dax zup walm"", ""zup"" is yellow and there are 4 unique words before walm (lug, wif, dax, zup), hence the output is ""yellow yellow yellow yellow"".
- In ""dax lug walm"", ""lug"" is blue and there are 2 unique words before walm (dax, lug), hence the output is ""blue blue"".
- In ""dax zup dax walm"", ""dax"" is green and there are 2 unique words before walm (dax, zup), but since ""dax"" appears twice, it doesn't increase the count, hence the output is ""green green"".
- In ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"", ""lug"" is blue and there are 3 unique words before walm (zup, dax, lug), hence the output is ""blue blue blue"".
- In ""dax walm zup lug walm"", for the first ""walm"", ""dax"" is green and is the only word before it, hence ""green"". For the second ""walm"", ""lug"" is blue and there are 3 unique words before the second walm (dax, zup, lug), hence ""blue blue blue"".",1.0,107,walm
"walm -> meaning. From the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" indicates repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. However, the repeated color is not simply the immediate prior color but instead the color associated with the first word of the sequence repeated as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the word sequence.

Rule: ""walm"" means repeat the color translation of the first word in the sequence for as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the sequence.",1.0,107,walm
"Observing the patterns in the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color that is indicated by the word preceding it. Let's break down the examples to understand this:

1. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to yellow, and the output is repeated yellow.

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to blue, and the output is repeated blue.

3. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to green, and the output is repeated green.

4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   
   In this case, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and again, we see repeated blue in the output corresponding to ""lug"".

5. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   
   Once again, ""walm"" follows the words that translate to green first, then blue, resulting in the repetition of those colors in the output.

Based on this analysis, the rule for the word ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color of the previous word to be repeated.

Rule: walm -> meaning: Repeat the color that the immediately preceding word represents.",1.0,107,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it multiple times. We can determine this by looking at how the color repetition coincides with the position of ""walm"" in each input. Here are the observations:

1. In the first input, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output is three instances of ""yellow.""
2. In the second input, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and the output is three instances of ""blue.""
3. In the third input, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and the output is four instances of ""green.""
4. In the fourth input, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and the output is three instances of ""blue.""
5. In the fifth input, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" but it is also preceded by ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green."" The output consists of three instances of ""green"" and then, after another ""lug,"" followed by ""walm"" gives three instances of ""blue.""

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the output to repeat the last color mentioned three times, although the third example introduces an anomaly by repeating the color four times. The anomaly could be due to an additional rule or condition not yet discerned from the provided examples.

"lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"".",1.0,108,lug

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,108,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green"" consistently when the word ""dax"" appears. When ""dax"" is used in various contexts among other nonce words such as ""zup"" and ""lug,"" the color green is still given as the output for ""dax."" The other two words, ""zup"" and ""lug,"" whenever they first occur, result in ""yellow"" and ""blue"" respectively, but keep changing to ""green"" when ""dax"" is introduced around them.

Hence, the rule appears to be that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green,"" and it also seems to influence the output of other nonce words to become ""green"" if ""dax"" is repeated within the string.

"Based on the examples given, each instance of the nonce word 'dax' corresponds to the output 'green'.

"Based on the examples provided, we are trying to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by examining the contexts in which it appears and the corresponding colors in the output. Let's look at the contexts where ""wif"" is present:

2. wif -> red
3. lug wif -> blue red
4. wif bluf -> red red
5. dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green

We can see that everytime the word ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" corresponds to it in the output. Regardless of the word that comes after ""wif"" or words that precede it, ""red"" consistently associates with ""wif."" There is no example where ""wif"" results in a color other than ""red.""

Hence, we can induce the following rule:

"wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word 'wif' appears in the input, the corresponding output is 'red'.",1.0,108,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we should look for patterns associated with its use in various inputs and the corresponding outputs. Throughout all inputs, ""wif"" consistently results in ""red"" in the output.

Here are the observed patterns:
- Regardless of its position in the input (beginning, middle, or end), ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
- The word ""wif"" does not seem to affect the color output of adjacent words, as those words correspond to colors based on some other rule.
- The word ""wif"" seems to be independent in its meaning, as it does not change when combined with other words.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,108,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" translates to a specific color. In every example where ""wif"" is present, ""red"" appears in the output. There are no instances where ""wif"" is used and ""red"" is not in the output. Additionally, the other nonce words (""bluf,"" ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup"") are each consistently paired with their own color outputs throughout the examples (""bluf"" with ""red,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow"").

Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

wif -> meaning. Meaning: ""red""",1.0,108,wif
"Based on the given examples and associated outputs, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" Thus, the rule seems to be as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,108,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" it is useful to look at the structure of the input sentences and how they correspond to the colored output sequences. Let's look at each example and output:

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow
We notice that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
Here, ""bluf"" still corresponds to ""yellow""; it is consistent with the first example.

Input: zup lug dax
Output: yellow blue green
By this example, ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green"" and a new word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: wif dax zup bluf
Output: red green yellow yellow
Based on this, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""bluf"" to ""yellow,"" which is consistent with previous examples.

Input: dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow
In the previous examples, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" here instead of the usual ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and what's left is ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow.""

If we assume each word corresponds to a particular color and the structure of the output follows the structure of the input, we can infer that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" since it consistently produces ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sentence.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,108,zup
"Given the examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" has a consistent output in the color ""yellow."" Based on this, it can be deduced that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Here is the rule based on the examples provided:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,108,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" In each instance where ""zup"" appears, the output includes ""yellow."" It is also notable that the position of ""zup"" in the input does not change the output color; ""zup"" always results in ""yellow"" regardless of where it appears in the sequence.

Hence, the rule is:

zup -> yellow",1.0,108,zup
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let’s analyze its usage and the associated outputs in the provided examples.

Example analysis:

2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
3. zup lug dax -> yellow blue green
4. wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow
5. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow

If we examine the positions of ""zup"" and their corresponding colors in the output, we can attempt to identify a pattern.

- In examples 1 and 2, ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and the output color corresponding to ""zup"" is ""yellow"" in both cases.
- In example 3, ""zup"" is positioned before ""lug"" and the output color for ""zup"" is ""yellow"" again. However, the corresponding color for ""lug"" is ""blue.""
- In example 4, ""zup"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""bluf"" with its output color being ""yellow.""
- In example 5, ""zup"" is the last word in the sequence and still corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Looking at the provided examples, ""zup"" consistently corresponds with the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words. Thus, we can infer the meaning of ""zup"" based on these examples:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,108,zup
"Observing the examples given and the respective outputs, it seems that 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow'. Each time 'zup' is present in the input, the color 'yellow' appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word 'zup' is:

zup -> yellow",1.0,108,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color that corresponds to the word that immediately precedes it. Let's examine the examples more closely:

1. dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green

2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow

- In the second example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", resulting in the color yellow being repeated.
- In the third, ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"", and red is repeated.
- In the fourth, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", and yellow is repeated.
- In the fifth, ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"", and again yellow is repeated.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> yellow.,0.4,108,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs in relation to the presence of ""walm"" in each input:

1. ""zup walm wif"" generates ""yellow yellow yellow red"". Without ""walm,"" ""zup"" generates ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" generates ""red.""
2. ""wif dax zup walm"" results in ""red green yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""wif"" generates ""red,"" ""dax"" generates ""green,"" and ""zup"" generates ""yellow.""
3. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" produces ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"". In this sequence, ""lug"" generates ""blue,"" ""wif"" generates ""red,"" ""dax"" generates ""green,"" and ""zup"" generates ""yellow.""
4. ""wif lug walm"" results in ""red blue blue blue"". Here, ""wif"" generates ""red,"" and ""lug"" generates ""blue.""
5. ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue"". The word ""lug"" generates ""blue.""

From these examples, the rule becomes clear: the presence of ""walm"" in the input replicates the color output of the word immediately preceding it, generating a repeated sequence of that color.

Rule: walm -> replicates the color output of the immediate preceding word in the sequence.",1.0,108,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to create a repetition of the color that corresponds to the preceding word, effectively repeating the output color as many times as the position of ""walm"" within the sequence. More specifically, the last color before ""walm"" is repeated a number of times equal to its position following the sequence start. For example, if ""walm"" is the second word, the preceding color is repeated two times; if ""walm"" is the fifth word, the preceding color is repeated five times.

Here are the examples broken down:

- In the first example, ""zup walm wif"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""wif"" implies red. ""Walm"" comes second and results in the repetition of the yellow output twice, followed by the output for ""wif"".
- In the second example, the sequence ""wif dax zup walm"" leads to the colors red, green, yellow being produced, and then ""walm"" causes the repetition of the third color, yellow, three times given its sequence position.
- The third example shows ""walm"" at the end of a four-word sequence. The fourth color, in this case yellow, is repeated four times after the sequence ""lug wif dax zup"".
- When ""walm"" follows immediately after two words, as in ""wif lug walm"", it repeats the color blue, corresponding to ""lug"", twice, as it is the third word in the sequence.
- Finally, with ""lug walm"" being a two-word input, the color blue is repeated twice, as ""walm"" is the second word, thus repeating the output related to ""lug"".

Rule: Walm repeats the color of the preceding word in the output as many times as the position of ""walm"" within the input sequence.

Walm -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the sequence.",1.0,108,walm
"To deduce the meaning or rule behind the word ""walm,"" let's compare the input and output sequences provided in the examples.

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

From the examples, we can observe the following:

- When ""walm"" appears after ""zup,"" it results in two yellows in the output (""yellow yellow"").
- When ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" it results in triple blue in the output (""blue blue blue"").
- From the last two examples, we can infer that the output yields a sequence of a single color, repeated as many times as there are words following ""walm,"" plus one.
- ""Walm"" doesn't simply map to a single word or color because its output is context-dependent—it seems that ""walm"" indicates a repetition based on the color of the word that precedes it.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word that directly precedes ""walm"" in the output, doing so as many times as there are words following ""walm"" in the input, plus one. If there are no words after ""walm,"" repeat the color just once.",0.9,108,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in each example:

1. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
2. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow
3. lug wif dax zup walm -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow
4. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
5. lug walm -> blue blue blue

From the examples, we notice that ""walm"" seems to replicate the color associated with the word preceding it for as many times as it repeats. 

For example:
- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm"" we see yellow repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""zup"" comes before ""walm"" and we again observe ""yellow"" being repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""zup"" comes before ""walm,"" and again there's a repetition of ""yellow"" three times.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" comes before ""walm"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- In the fifth example, without other words for context, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times.

The rule seems to be: ""walm"" causes the color of the word directly before it to be output the same number of times as the word ""walm"" appears.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" is:
walm -> Repeat the output color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" for as many times as ""walm"" appears.",0.8,108,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer a rule for what ""walm"" may mean. Notice that each instance of ""walm"" in the outputs correlates with a repeated color.

Output: green green green red red red
- ""Dax"" at the beginning stays ""green,"" but the presence of ""walm"" seems to repeat this output, influencing also ""wif"" that follows.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- ""Dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" but after ""walm,"" we observe only ""blue"" in the output.

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the previous color word to repeat instead of following the sequence that would regularly occur. 

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeats the color represented by the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,109,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine each pair of input and output closely in order to identify patterns associated specifically with the occurrences of ""walm.""

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

Here, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue""; ""dax wif"" leads to ""green red""; but the sequence ""lug wif"" gives ""blue red."" The word ""walm"" appears to correspond with a repeated color before ""green"" appears.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

""Zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow red,"" but ""walm"" results in ""red red"" after ""wif.""

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

""Dax wif"" is ""green red,"" but again, ""walm"" following ""wif"" produces ""red red."" ""Lug zup walm"" gives ""blue yellow yellow yellow."" It appears that ""walm"" is introducing repetition of the color following it in the sequence.

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red

""Dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" may represent a triplet of the preceding or following color.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

""Dax lug"" produces ""green blue,"" and following ""lug,"" ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""

Based on the patterns observed in the above examples, ""walm"" appears to signify a repetition of the last color mentioned immediately before it appears.

Rule: walm -> ""repeat the last color mentioned three times.""",0.9,109,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns in which ""walm"" appears and how they correlate to the color outputs.

Looking at the outputs related to ""walm,"" we notice:

- When ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" the color sequence is ""blue blue"" (Example 1).
- When ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" the color sequence is ""red red red"" (Example 2, Example 3, Example 4).
- When ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" and before ""wif,"" it results in ""green red"" (Example 4).
- When ""walm"" appears immediately after ""dax,"" the color sequence is ""green green"" (Example 3 and Example 5).
- When ""walm"" appears alone after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"" (Example 3).

From these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" may determine a sequence of colors that repeat based on the word that immediately precedes it.

Now, let's propose a general rule based on the observations:

- After ""lug,"" ""walm"" tends to repeat the color blue twice.
- After ""wif,"" ""walm"" tends to repeat the color red three times.
- After ""dax,"" when followed by ""wif,"" ""walm"" leads to the sequence green red, but when ""wif"" does not follow, ""walm"" results in green being repeated.
- After ""zup,"" ""walm"" repeats the color yellow thrice.

Considering the examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the previous color that corresponds to a word to be repeated a certain number of times. The specific number of repetitions seems to depend on the word preceding ""walm.""

Based on these patterns, the rule for ""walm"" could be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to be repeated a number of times, where this number and the specific behavior are dependent on the preceding word. The known behaviors are:
- After ""lug"": repeat blue twice.
- After ""wif"": repeat red three times.
- After ""dax"" followed by ""wif"": results in the sequence green red.
- After ""dax"" without ""wif"" following: green is repeated twice.
- After ""zup"": repeat yellow three times.

However, we don't have consistent rules for cases involving ""dax"" that cover all possible configurations, such as ""dax"" followed by another word that is not ""wif."" The rule given is the best approximation based on the examples provided. Further examples, particularly involving ""dax"" followed by different words, would help to refine the rule for ""walm.""",0.8,109,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we must look for patterns in the examples given. Examining each instance where the word ""walm"" appears and identifying its corresponding output could reveal the underlying rule.

First, let's structure the given examples to make them clearer:

1. lug walm dax wif lug wif -> blue blue blue green red blue red
2. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
3. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
4. dax walm wif walm -> green green green red red red
5. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue

Now let's try to find a pattern by focusing on the occurrences of ""walm"" and their outputs:

1. walm appears after ""lug"" and before ""dax"" -> blue blue
2. walm appears after ""wif"" -> red red red
3. walm appears after ""wif"" and again after ""zup"" -> red red red, yellow yellow yellow
4. walm appears after ""dax"" and repeats after ""wif"" -> green green, red red
5. walm appears after ""lug"" -> blue blue blue

It seems that ""walm"" modifies the color that precedes it by repeating it several times. From the last example, if ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" then ""walm"" following ""lug"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.

Based on these observations, we can induce a potential rule: ""walm"" repeats the color output corresponding to the word that appears immediately before it. In examples 1, 4, and 5, ""walm"" repeats the color of the word preceding it three times. However, in examples 2 and 3, the repetition varies depending on the word before ""wif"" and ""zup"".

The pattern is not entirely consistent across all examples when considering the number of repetitions, which could be dependent on additional, unidentified factors.

However, there seems to be enough consistency to attempt a rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repetition of the color corresponding to the prior word, the number of repetitions may depend on multiple factors including the position of ""walm"" and the word that precedes it.",0.7,109,walm

Rule: The word ""lug"" correlates to the color blue in every example provided.",1.0,110,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.",1.0,110,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" Each occurrence of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,110,lug
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. This can be derived from each instance where ""lug"" is mentioned, the output is ""blue"". 

Additionally, there is a pattern where repeating nonces before ""lug"" correspond to an additional ""blue"" being added to the output for each repetition. For example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" leads to the output ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue"", where there is a single ""lug"" after ""bluf"" resulting in one instance of ""blue"", and a second ""lug"" after ""dax"" resulting in a repetition of ""blue"". 

It can be noticed that the number of ""blue"" in the output equals the number of times ""lug"" appeared in the input. Therefore, the repetition of words before ""lug"" does not influence how many times ""blue"" is output in regard to that instance of ""lug"".

To summarize: lug -> blue. Rule: Each occurrence of ""lug"" corresponds to an instance of the word ""blue"" in the output regardless of the words that precede it.",1.0,110,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the outputs.",1.0,110,lug
"To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze each input against its output:

- Wherever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green."" 
- When other words follow ""dax,"" they may correspond to different colors or the color red if there is no match.

From this, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green. Therefore, we can infer that ""dax"" means green. Thus:

dax -> green. Rule: Whenever ""dax"" is present, output ""green.""",1.0,110,dax
"From the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" correlates with the output ""green"" consistently. The meaning of ""dax"" seems to be independent of the context in which it is used. Therefore, based on the available data the rule can be deduced as follows:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green.""",1.0,110,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" has a consistent mapping to the color ""green."" Regardless of the context or the other words present, whenever ""dax"" appears as an input, the corresponding output has ""green"" at the beginning. The other words (""walm,"" ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" ""lug"") may correlate with other colors or triggers a different color when combined with ""dax.""

Here is the rule induction based on the examples:

- ""dax"" by itself or when it comes first in a sequence always maps to ""green.""
- ""wif"" following ""dax"" seems to consistently map to ""red.""
- ""bluf"" following ""dax"" maps to ""green.""
- ""lug"" following ""dax"" maps to ""blue.""

The rule for the meaning of ""dax"" would therefore be:

Rule: dax -> green

The overall consistency of ""dax"" mapping to ""green"" in different contexts supports this rule.",1.0,110,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's examine the consistent patterns between the inputs and outputs:

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

Input: dax
Output: green

Input: dax
Output: green

Input: dax bluf wif
Output: green green red

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue

Examining the inputs and their corresponding outputs, it is apparent that whenever ""dax"" appears on its own or as the first word in the sequence, the output is ""green."" If ""dax"" definitely meant ""green"" in every instance, we would expect to see the color ""green"" always following it. Here's the rule based on the given data:

- dax -> green, if ""dax"" is presented alone or as the first word.
- walm -> green, as it consistently corresponds to a ""green"" output when it follows ""dax.""
- wif -> red, when following ""dax"" and another word, which in both cases is ""green.""
- bluf -> green, when it is the second word following ""dax.""
- lug -> blue, when it follows ""dax.""

Therefore, assuming the consistency of these patterns and no further context, the rule we can deduce is that ""dax"" indicates a ""green"" output when it appears alone or as the first word in a sequence. Based on the consistency of ""green"" responses to ""dax,"" the other words seem to determine the color that follows, potentially in relation to their position or the specific word itself. Here is the rule:

Rule: dax -> green, when presented alone or as the first word. The meaning of ""dax"" is probably ""green"" based on the consistent output when it appears.",0.9,110,dax
"From the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or the rules associated with the word ""dax"":

1. When ""dax"" appears alone, the output is always green. This suggests that ""dax"" may mean green itself or that it prompts the color green in the output.

2. In combinations, ""dax"" precedes other words which appear to correspond to certain colors in the output. For example:
   - ""dax walm wif"" yields ""green green green red""
   - ""dax bluf wif"" yields ""green green red""

   This suggests that ""wif"" may correspond to red, as it does not matter what precedes it, the output color is the same.

3. In the sequence ""dax lug,"" the output is ""green blue,"" implying that ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

If we consider the word ""dax"" as a prompt for a specific color in this context based on the consistency of green as the output whenever ""dax"" appears, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Each subsequent word seems to represent a specific color in the output, with ""dax"" always corresponding to green, ""wif"" to red, and ""lug"" to blue. The word ""bluf"" and ""walm"" do not have enough examples to determine their corresponding colors with certainty, but it seems that ""bluf"" may not correspond directly to green or red as those colors are already accounted for by ""dax"" and ""wif"" respectively.

In the fourth input, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the output color is ""blue"" again, which matches ""lug.""

Input 3: ...bluf...
Output 3: ...green...

Input 4: ...bluf...
Output 4: ...blue...

Input 5: ...bluf...
Output 5: ...red...

The word ""bluf"" corresponds to different colors in different contexts. So it's not a one-to-one mapping to a particular color. However, we can see that ""bluf"" always takes the color of the word immediately preceding it:

- In input 1, the word before ""bluf"" is ""lug,"" and the corresponding color is blue, so ""bluf"" is blue.
- In input 2, the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" and the corresponding color is green, so ""bluf"" is green.
- In input 3, the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" and thus ""bluf"" is green again.
- In input 4, the word before ""bluf"" is ""lug,"" and hence ""bluf"" is blue.
- In input 5, the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" making ""bluf"" red.

Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,111,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" we should look at the patterns in which the word appears and the corresponding outputs.

In the first example, we have ""zup dax lug walm zup lug,"" which corresponds to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue."" In this string, ""lug"" appears twice and both times ""blue"" is the output. It also follows that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" based on the output.

In the second example, ""wif bluf dax lug"" translates to ""red red green blue."" Here, ""lug"" is at the end again and corresponds to ""blue.""

In the third example, ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue."" Yet once again, the output for ""lug"" is ""blue.""

The fourth example, ""lug walm,"" is output as ""blue blue blue."" In this case, it suggests that ""walm"" also corresponds to ""blue,"" but importantly, ""lug"" is still ""blue.""

Lastly, the fifth example, ""zup wif lug dax,"" corresponds to ""yellow red blue green."" Here ""lug"" follows ""wif"" and comes before ""dax,"" and still, the word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Based on these examples, every appearance of the word ""lug"" in the input results in the color ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green,1.0,111,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently correlates with the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string. Each input that contains the word ""dax"" has a corresponding ""green"" in the output at the same position.

Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,111,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,111,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern that correlates the nonce word ""dax"" with a corresponding color in English. Here is the pattern that emerges from each sequence of inputs and outputs:

- When ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
- The appearance of ""dax"" does not seem to be dependent on its position in the sequence; it consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of where it is placed.

Therefore, using the pattern observed, we can induce that the meaning of ""dax"" is ""green"".

- ""wif"" is associated with ""red""
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow""
- ""dax"" is associated with ""green""
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue""

"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to be a nonce word used in place of a color. However, to deduce the rule governing its meaning, let's compare each input with its respective output:

1. Input: wif bluf lug -> Output: red red blue
2. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
3. Input: wif dax zup bluf -> Output: red green yellow yellow
4. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
5. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

After close examination, the following pattern emerges:

- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""

The word ""bluf"" appears after a different color word in every instance, and the color that follows ""bluf"" is always the same as the one before it:

1. ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (which means red) and the output is ""red""
2. ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (which means blue) and the output is ""blue""
3. ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (the new word in the example, not seen before, but if we consider ""zup"" means yellow, the pattern holds as the output after bluf is also ""yellow"")
4. ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (which means green) and the output is ""green""
5. ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which we've deduced could mean yellow), and the output is also ""yellow""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" represents a color and it means the same color as the word that comes immediately before it.

Bluf -> meaning: The same color as the preceding color word.",1.0,111,bluf
"From the examples given, we can analyze the positions of the nonce word ""bluf"" and its corresponding translations in the Output to figure out the pattern or rule it follows. 

First example:
- Input: wif bluf lug
- Output: red red blue

Second example:
- Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
- Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

Third example:
- Input: wif dax zup bluf
- Output: red green yellow yellow

Fourth example:
- Input: dax bluf
- Output: green green 

Fifth example:
- Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
- Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

By comparing the Input and Output in each example, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to the color that is represented by the word immediately preceding it. Thus, it seems like ""bluf"" might function as a sort of echo for the preceding color word.

First example:
- ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red"", so ""bluf"" echoes the red from ""wif.""

Second example:
- ""lug bluf"" becomes ""blue blue"", so ""bluf"" echoes the blue from ""lug.""

Third example:
- ""zup bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow"", so ""bluf"" echoes the yellow from ""zup.""

Fourth example:
- ""dax bluf"" becomes ""green green"" so ""bluf"" echoes the green from ""dax.""

Fifth example:
- ""zup bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow"", so again, ""bluf"" echoes the yellow from ""zup.""

Rule: bluf -> echoes the color of the previous word.",1.0,111,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". However, in the third input-output pair, ""zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue"" where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"". Therefore, ""bluf"" does not consistently map to ""blue"".

Let's look deeper into the patterns:
- Whenever ""bluf"" immediately follows ""lug"" or ""wif,"" it corresponds to ""blue"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" or ""dax,"" it translates to ""yellow"" or ""green"", respectively. This suggests that ""bluf"" might reflect the color immediately preceding it.

Let's re-evaluate the examples with this hypothesis:
- In the second input-output pair: ""lug bluf wif"" translates to ""blue blue red,"" where ""bluf"" following ""lug"" becomes ""blue.""
- In the third input-output pair: ""zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue,"" where ""bluf"" following ""zup"" becomes ""yellow.""
- In the fourth input-output pair: ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" where ""bluf"" following ""dax"" becomes ""green.""
- In the fifth input-output pair: ""zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue,"" sticking to the pattern where ""bluf"" following ""zup"" becomes ""yellow.""

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" changes based on the color word immediately preceding it. Specifically, if ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" or ""wif,"" it means ""blue"". If ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it means ""yellow"". If ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it means ""green"". There's no example with ""bluf"" at the beginning of an input to see what it maps to without a preceding color word. Thus:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: The color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""bluf."" If ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" or ""wif,"" it's ""blue""; if ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it's ""yellow""; if ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it's ""green"".",0.8,111,bluf

Rule: bluf -> blue,0.0,111,bluf
"walm -> blue repeated once for every preceding 'lug' before it, red otherwise.

- When 'walm' is not directly preceded by 'lug', it translates to 'red'.",1.0,111,walm
"walm -> meaning: three consecutive appearances of the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule:

1. If the word before walm is lug, the color blue is repeated three times (as seen in the first and third examples).
2. If the word before walm is dax, the color red is repeated three times (as seen in the fourth and fifth examples).
3. If walm stands alone without a preceding word, it defaults to the color blue repeated three times (as seen in the second example, when it follows lug earlier in the sequence).",1.0,111,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns across the examples:

1) When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the color sequence is ""blue blue blue.""
   - Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   - Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

2) When ""walm"" is between ""lug"" and ""zup,"" we again get the color sequence ""blue blue blue.""
   - Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   - Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

3) When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""wif,"" the color after ""wif"" changes from red to red red.
   - Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   - Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

4) When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""lug,"" the color sequence is ""green blue blue blue.""
   - Input: dax lug walm
   - Output: green blue blue blue

5) When ""walm"" follows directly after ""dax wif,"" the color sequence alters to introduce extra reds.
   - Input: dax wif walm
   - Output: green red red red

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" has the following effects:

- After ""lug,"" it generates three ""blue.""
- After ""dax wif,"" it leads to repeated ""red.""

Rule: ""walm"" following ""lug"" results in a repetition of the color ""blue"" three times, but when following ""dax wif,"" it repeats the color ""red."" There's no clear pattern for ""walm"" on its own or after other words that weren't repeated in examples, so the rule may depend on the previous word(s).

walm -> Repetition of the last color; after ""lug,"" it's blue, after ""dax wif,"" it's red.",0.8,111,walm
"Based on the given input and output examples, we can attempt to deduce a pattern that relates the nonce word ""walm"" to the colors mentioned in the outputs. We notice that when ""walm"" appears, it translates to a sequence of colors. Here are some observations:

1. Whenever ""walm"" appears, there is a repetition of a color in the output.
2. The color that is repeated correlates with the word preceding ""walm"" in the input.

For example:
- In the first input, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" and ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the fourth input, ""lug walm"" again results in ""blue blue blue,"" maintaining consistency with the observation above.
- In the fifth input, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" and ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red.""

Using these observations, we can conclude the following:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Indicates a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that appears immediately before ""walm."" The number of repetitions, based on given data, appears to be three.

So, for a general rule dependent on context, we have:

walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.",0.8,111,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine where it appears and how the outputs correlate:

In the first example, we have ""lug walm zup"" mapping to ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" could mean ""blue."" However, there's another ""zup"" after ""lug"" and it maps to ""yellow,"" indicating that the color might depend on the position relative to other words or that ""walm"" affects the word after it.

In the second example, we have ""lug walm zup"" resulting in ""blue blue blue yellow."" The presence of ""walm"" here again suggests it could cause the word after it (""zup"") to output ""blue"" consistently.

In the third example, we have ""wif walm"" mapping to ""red red red,"" again suggesting that ""walm"" causes the word before it (""wif"") to repeat its color.

In the fourth example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" which is consistent with the previously seen pattern of ""walm"" causing the repetition of the color of the word before it.

In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" also results in ""red red red,"" reinforcing the pattern.

Rule: walm causes the color of the word before it to repeat, effectively duplicating the output color of the previous word. If ""lug"" is blue and ""wif"" is red, then ""walm"" following these words would repeat ""blue"" and ""red"" respectively.

There is a one-to-one relationship between the word ""dax"" and the color ""green."" Whenever ""dax"" appears in an input, ""green"" appears in the equivalent position in the output. Other words have their own color associations, for instance, ""bluf"" -> ""red"" and ""wif"" -> ""red"". The word ""lug"" appears only once, but it corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.

2. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue

2. In ""dax bluf wif lug,"" ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which has been translated to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" also becomes ""green"".

Rule: bluf -> the meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it in the sequence.",1.0,112,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word 'bluf' directly translates to a series of two 'red' followed by an iterative presentation of 'blue' based on the number of times the words 'wif,' 'lug,' or 'walm' appear before it in the input. Here is the breakdown:

- Every time the word 'bluf' appears, 'red red' is included in the output.
- For each 'wif,' 'lug,' or 'walm' that appears before 'bluf' in the input, an additional 'blue' is added to the output after 'red red.'

Example deductions:
- Input: ""wif bluf"" only contains one 'wif' before 'bluf,' so the output is ""red red.""
- Input: ""wif walm lug bluf"" includes three words before 'bluf,' namely 'wif,' 'walm,' and 'lug.' Hence, there are three additional 'blue' in the output after ""red red.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that 'bluf' translates to 'red red' plus as many 'blue' as there are occurrences of the words 'wif,' 'lug,' or 'walm' before 'bluf.'

Rule: bluf -> ""red red"" plus one ""blue"" for each 'wif,' 'lug,' or 'walm' that appears before it.",0.8,112,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to relate to a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. The number of times the color is repeated corresponds with the number of syllables in the word preceding ""walm.""

Here is the analysis supporting the rule:

- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" (The word ""lug"" is associated with the color blue and has one syllable; the color is repeated once.)
- ""zup wif dax walm"" -> ""yellow red green green green"" (The word ""dax"" is associated with the color green and has one syllable; the color is repeated once.)
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> ""red red red blue blue"" (The word ""wif"" is associated with the color red and has one syllable; the color is repeated once.)
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" (The word ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow and has one syllable; the color is repeated once.)
- ""dax walm zup lug"" -> ""green green green yellow blue"" (The word ""dax"" is associated with the color green and has one syllable; the color is repeated once.)

Given this pattern, we can define the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word a number of times equal to the number of syllables in that word.",1.0,112,walm
"Observing the examples:

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Input: zup wif dax walm
Output: yellow red green green green

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue

From these examples, it seems that 'walm' causes repetition of the color word that comes before it. The number of repetitions, including the original occurrence, is determined by the sequential position of the word that comes before 'walm'. For example, if the word before 'walm' is the second word of the input, it will be repeated twice.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:
walm -> Repeat the preceding color based on its position in the input sequence.

Rule: If 'walm' is preceded by a color word, the output will repeat that color word as many times as its position number. If 'lug' (which corresponds to 'blue') comes right before walm and it is the first word, the output is 'blue' three times. If 'dax' (which corresponds to 'green') is third in the sequence and comes right before 'walm', 'green' is outputted four times because 'dax' is the third word. The same logic applies to 'zup' (which corresponds to 'yellow') before 'walm', resulting in three 'yellow' as it is the second word in the sequence.",1.0,112,walm
"Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" when used in an input sequence, causes the output to consist of a repeated sequence of the color associated with the word directly preceding ""walm"". The number of repetitions of the color in the output matches the number of letters in the word that precedes ""walm"".

For each example:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Rule Application: The word ""lug"" associates with the color blue and has three letters, so the output is blue repeated three times.

2. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   Rule Application: The word ""dax"" precedes ""walm"". The color associated with ""dax"" is green, and ""dax"" has three letters, hence green is repeated three times.

3. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   Rule Application: The word ""wif"" precedes ""walm"". The color associated with ""wif"" is red, and ""wif"" has three letters, hence red is repeated three times.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Rule Application: The word ""zup"" precedes ""walm"". The color associated with ""zup"" is yellow, and ""zup"" has three letters, hence yellow is repeated three times.

5. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   Rule Application: The word ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and therefore, green is repeated three times correlating with the three letters in ""dax"".

Therefore, walm -> When a color-coded word precedes ""walm"", the output is the color associated with that word repeated as many times as there are letters in the word.",1.0,112,walm
"Examining the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue""; since ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"", this suggests that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes this color word to be repeated three times.

- In the second example, ""zup"" seems to correspond with ""yellow,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""dax"" with ""green"". Following this pattern, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" implying that ""walm"" repeats the color word ""green"" three times.

- In the third example, ""wif walm lug bluf"" leads to ""red red red blue blue"", further supporting the rule that ""walm"" repeats the color three times and ""lug"" leads to ""blue."" However, ""bluf"" seems unrelated since it does not produce a repetition.

- In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting the repetition of ""yellow"" three times due to the presence of ""walm.""

- Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax walm zup lug"" creates ""green green green yellow blue,"" which aligns with the previous deductions where ""dax"" leads to ""green"" and it's repeated three times because of ""walm,"" followed by ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and ""blue"" for ""lug.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the preceding color word three times.",1.0,112,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""walm"" appears to depend on the word preceding it. The output is a repetition of a color word, and the number of repetitions corresponds to the position of a specific color word in a sequence. From the given data, we can infer the following:

- ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""blue blue blue"" (3 times blue)
- ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"" (3 times yellow)
- ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""green green green"" (3 times green)
- ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""red red red"" (3 times red)

It appears that ""walm"" functions as a command to repeat the color associated with the word before it, three times. Therefore:

- In the second example, ""lug dax"" translates directly to ""blue green,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to blue and ""dax"" to green.
- The third example includes other words such as ""wif"" and ""walm,"" which correspond to red and yellow, respectively. Regardless of their placement, ""dax"" still corresponds to green.
- The fourth example shows ""dax"" in a different position, between ""lug"" (blue) and ""walm"" (yellow yellow yellow), yet ""dax"" still results in green.
- The fifth example simply has ""dax bluf,"" where ""bluf"" seems to correspond to green, as does ""dax.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look for patterns in the examples given.

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output is ""red.""
- There do not appear to be any conditions tied to ""wif"" that alter its output.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green in the given examples. Each time ""bluf"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""green"" is included in the output.",1.0,113,bluf

3. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue
4. zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green green red
5. dax bluf -> green green

To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's check if the output of ""bluf"" is consistent regardless of its position:

- In examples 1 and 5, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", and the output for both is ""green"".
- In examples 2 and 3, ""bluf"" is the word that ends the sequence and its output is ""yellow"" and ""blue"" respectively, which follows the colour of the preceding word (""lug"" -> ""blue"" and ""zup"" -> ""yellow"").
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is again ""green"", but it is not the final word in the sequence.

The information suggests that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word immediately preceding it except for when it appears at the end of a sequence, in which case it might repeat the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word. If ""bluf"" is the last word in the sequence, it repeats the color of the word directly before it.",0.8,113,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the repetition of a color three times seems to correspond to the nonce word ""walm"". Each unique input word (wif, dax, zup, lug) is associated with a different color (red, green, yellow, and blue respectively) whenever they appear. When ""walm"" follows any of these words, the color corresponding to that word is repeated three times.

Here is how ""walm"" operates for each word:

1. wif walm -> red red red (wif corresponds to red, walm repeats the color thrice)
2. dax walm -> green green green (dax corresponds to green, walm repeats the color thrice)
3. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow (zup corresponds to yellow, walm repeats the color thrice)
4. lug walm -> blue blue blue (lug corresponds to blue, walm repeats the color thrice)

Hence, the rule for walm seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",1.0,113,walm
"From the examples given, we can infer that:

1. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"", implying that ""walm"" following ""wif"" transforms ""wif"" into three reds.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""lug""; ""dax"" transforms into three greens and ""lug"" into one blue followed by two more due to the following ""walm"".
3. In the third example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" and ""walm zup"" in one yellow followed by two more.
4. The fourth example repeats the patterns above, with the word ""walm"" causing the previous word to repeat its color three times.
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"", turning it into ""red red red"", and is followed by ""dax"", which doesn't repeat since there's a ""zup"" breaking the pattern with its own color.

Based on these observations, we can conclude that ""walm"" causes the previous word to output its corresponding color three times. If there is no previous color-specific word immediately before ""walm"", then ""walm"" has no visible effect.

Rule: walm -> When following a word, it repeats the corresponding color of that word three times. If ""walm"" follows a color word (wif, dax, lug, zup), it repeats that color three times.

- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""zup"" -> yellow

Now, let's apply this to determine the meaning:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the following word to repeat three times in the translated form (where each word is associated with a specific color).

Thus,

walm -> meaning: causes the next word to be translated and repeated three times.",1.0,113,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should compare the ""Input"" strings with their corresponding ""Output"" colors. It appears that ""walm"" is linked to the repetition of a color that correlates with the word that comes directly before ""walm.""

Here is a breakdown of how ""walm"" is influencing the output:

1. ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red"" – ""wif"" must mean ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated twice more.

2. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"" – ""dax"" must mean ""green,"" and ""zup"" must mean ""yellow,"" while ""lug"" means ""blue."" Here, ""walm"" causes the color before it (""green"" for ""dax"" and ""blue"" for ""lug"") to be repeated twice more.

3. ""lug walm zup wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue yellow red"" – consistent with the meanings above, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" causing ""blue"" to be repeated twice more, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""

4. ""zup walm lug wif"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red"" – consistent with the meanings above, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" causing ""yellow"" to be repeated twice more, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""

5. ""wif walm dax zup"" corresponds to ""red red red green yellow"" – confirming again that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" which is repeated twice more due to ""walm,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, ""walm"" appears to cause the preceding color word to triple in the output. If the previous word corresponds to a color, ""walm"" makes that color appear three times instead of once.

wif -> red",1.0,115,wif
"From the given examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" translates to the word ""yellow."" The color yellow is consistently mentioned in the output each time ""zup"" appears in the input. Here is the rule based on the examples provided:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,115,zup
"zup -> yellow

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,115,zup
"Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" correlates consistently with the color ""yellow."" It appears that regardless of the context or the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence, the output always contains the color ""yellow"" in the corresponding position. The rule seems straightforward as ""zup"" does not appear to modify or be modified by adjacent words.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,115,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each given example.",1.0,115,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the provided examples and identify patterns that associate with the occurrences of the word ""bluf.""

From the first example:
- Input: zup wif bluf
- Output: yellow red red

From the second example:
- Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
- Output: blue red green green red blue

From the third example:
- Input: wif bluf
- Output: red red

From the fourth example:
- Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
- Output: red blue blue red yellow

From the fifth example:
- Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
- Output: red green red red yellow red

Reviewing these examples, we can observe the following:
1. In each case, ""bluf"" is followed by the color ""red"" in the output.
2. When ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" it is translated as ""red red."" This indicates that ""bluf"" might simply translate to ""red"" and ""wif"" might translate to ""red"" by itself as well.
3. When ""bluf"" occurs between other words (such as ""lug"" or ""dax"") that correspond to other colors, it is always represented as ""red"" in the output.

By analyzing these patterns, we can infer that regardless of its position or the words around it, ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,115,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""bluf"" by looking for patterns corresponding to its use and the output provided.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red""
   Here ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and we assume ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red.""

2. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""blue red green green red blue""
   In this example, we can see that ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""dax"" is ""green."" Since we have ""bluf"" in the middle and the outputs around it are ""green green,"" if we associate ""bluf"" with ""green,"" it messes the order and the assumption that ""wif"" is always ""red."" Since we have ""red"" on both sides of ""bluf,"" it could still stand for ""red.""

3. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
   This example supports the idea that ""wif"" and ""bluf"" both correspond to ""red,"" as there are no other words to consider.

4. ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" -> ""red blue blue red yellow""
   Here, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" The word ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" which is ""blue"" but if ""bluf"" stood for ""blue"" we would expect a different color after it, as we have seen ""wif"" stand for ""red"" consistently. Because ""red"" comes after ""bluf,"" we maintain the assumption that ""bluf"" is ""red.""

5. ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" -> ""red green red red yellow red""
   In this example, ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow."" Since ""bluf"" is followed by ""red"" again, consistent with previous patterns, we can infer that ""bluf"" likely also represents ""red.""

Based on the observations of each output sequence, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to correspond with the color ""red."" Each time ""bluf"" is used, the output is ""red"" in the position that ""bluf"" appears. Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" is consistent with the color ""red,"" and it does not seem to depend on context or position.

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,115,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", let's analyze the patterns in the examples given and match the inputs to their corresponding outputs, focusing on the appearance and position of ""bluf"":

1. Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red
2. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> Output: blue red green green red blue
3. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
4. Input: wif lug bluf wif zup -> Output: red blue blue red yellow
5. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> Output: red green red red yellow red

Noticing from the above pairs, ""bluf"" always corresponds to ""red"" in the output. Additionally, ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" So when ""bluf"" appears, it is always followed or preceded by ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif"" in all instances, suggesting ""bluf"" also translates to ""red"" and possibly operates as a repetition of the preceding or following color, which is also ""red"" (from ""wif""). 

Taking this into consideration, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,115,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule for the nonce word ""bluf."" Let's observe how ""bluf"" appears and what colors correspond to it and its surrounding words:

1. ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red""
2. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""blue red green green red blue""
3. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
4. ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" -> ""red blue blue red yellow""
5. ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" -> ""red green red red yellow red""

We can first notice that ""bluf"" always translates to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input. Also, the word ""wif"" always translates to ""red."" This pattern is consistent regardless of the words that come before or after ""bluf"" or ""wif.""

Now we'll define the rule:

Rule: bluf -> ""red""

The meaning of ""bluf"" is the color ""red.""",1.0,115,bluf
"Observing the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" by looking for patterns. 

In the first input, ""bluf"" corresponds to two instances of ""red.""

In the second input, ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""wif dax"" and ""wif lug,"" and the outputs surrounding ""bluf"" are respectively ""green"" followed by ""red,"" which are the outputs for ""dax"" and ""lug.""

In the third input, ""bluf"" follows a ""wif"" and is translated only to ""red.""

In the fourth input, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""wif zup,"" producing an output of two ""blue"" followed by ""red yellow,"" with the ""blue"" corresponding to ""lug,"" and ""red yellow"" corresponding to ""wif zup.""

In the fifth input, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup wif,"" and produces two ""red""s followed by ""yellow red,"" which are the outputs for ""zup wif.""

From these examples, we can induce the rule that ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color output of the word just before it. When ""bluf"" is used after ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""red red."" When ""bluf"" is used after ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" the output is ""blue blue."" This repetition does not apply when ""bluf"" is surrounded by words with different corresponding colors, in that case, ""bluf"" produces two ""red""s. 

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color output of the previous word. If preceding word is ""wif,"" output for ""bluf"" is ""red red."" If the repeat sequence is interrupted by a differing color, default to ""red red.""",0.8,115,bluf
"Walm -> repeats the color correlated with the preceding word. Rule: The output color is repeated as many times as the length of the word ""walm."" For example, ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" and the word ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times, as ""walm"" is four letters long but seems to always subtract one from its length.",1.0,115,walm
"Rule: Walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. 

Explanation:
- ""Dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" meaning ""dax"" is associated with the color green, and ""walm"" indicates it should be repeated three times.
  
- ""Lug walm wif bluf"" gives ""blue blue blue red red,"" suggesting ""lug"" is associated with blue, ""wif"" with red, ""bluf"" is a repetition indicator for whatever color ""wif"" is associated with, and ""walm"" again causes the color of ""lug"" (blue) to be repeated three times.

- ""Zup wif walm"" outputs ""yellow red red red,"" so ""zup"" is associated with yellow, ""wif"" with red, and ""walm"" causes red to be repeated three times.

- ""Zup walm"" has an output of ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes the color of ""zup"" (yellow) to be repeated three times.

- ""Wif bluf dax walm"" leads to ""red red green green green,"" where ""wif"" is associated with red, ""bluf"" causes red to be repeated twice (instead of once for ""wif"" alone), ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""walm"" results in green being repeated three times.

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to mean repeating the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,115,walm
"Analyzing the input to output relationship, it seems that the word ""walm"" directly influences the tripling of the color word that immediately precedes it in the sentence:

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" which suggests ""dax"" means ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes it to repeat thrice.
- ""lug walm"" yields ""blue blue blue,"" indicating ""lug"" likely means ""blue,"" with ""walm"" again causing a triple repetition.
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" triples it.
- When another color word (like ""wif bluf"" or ""wif"") precedes ""walm,"" the non-""walm"" word is unaffected, and ""walm"" does not appear to cause repetition of ""wif,"" which in turn might mean that ""walm"" only affects the immediately preceding word and that word must be a sole color descriptor.

Given this, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the immediate color word preceding it to be outputted three times. If there is no immediately preceding color word, or if the precedent word is a non-color descriptor (such as ""wif""), ""walm"" has no effect.",0.9,115,walm
"To deduce what ""walm"" means, let's look at each example and the associated output.

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Here, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and results in three greens.

2. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   We see that ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" and yields three blues. ""wif"" and ""bluf"" result in two reds, but their relation to ""walm"" is not yet clear.

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and results in one yellow followed by ""wif"" which seems to affect the result after ""walm,"" yielding three reds.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Without ""wif,"" ""zup"" when followed by ""walm"" gives us three yellows, suggesting ""wif"" affects the output after ""walm,"" but ""zup"" alone does not.

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   The presence of ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" and ""dax"" before ""walm"" suggests that ""dax"" has the dominant influence on the output after ""walm.""

Considering these examples, it seems that ""walm"" replicates the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it, multiplying the output by three. It also appears that ""wif"" has the ability to change the color output after ""walm,"" converting it to red regardless of the preceding color.

Based on these observations, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: ""walm"" -> ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. If ""wif"" is present before ""walm,"" the output is red instead of the expected color.

Further analysis suggests that each word (except ""walm"") has its own associated color:
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- bluf -> (potentially related to red, but it is unclear if it has its own color or is influenced by the presence of ""wif"")",0.8,115,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce what ""walm"" means by looking at the patterns in both the input and output. Let's examine each instance:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
2. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

From this, we can make some initial observations:

- Whenever ""walm"" is present, the output has a repetition of colors.
- The number of repeated colors correlates with the position of ""walm"" in the input:
    - When ""walm"" is the second word, there are three repeated colors.
    - When ""walm"" is the third word, there are four repeated colors.
    - When ""walm"" is the fourth word, there are five repeated colors.
- The color that is repeated seems to be decided by the color word directly preceding ""walm"":
    - When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated.
    - When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated.
    - When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated.
- When ""walm"" is not directly preceded by a color word, the previous rules do not appear to apply, as is the case with Example 5.

To encapsulate these observations into a rule, one might initially propose:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color directly preceding it a number of times equal to its position in the input sequence.

However, this rule is contradicted by Example 5, which requires an amendment. Upon closer inspection, Example 5 seems to show that when there is more than one color word, ""walm"" causes all preceding colors to be repeated, but the number of repetitions is based on the position of ""walm"":

- ""wif bluf"" implies red and blue.
- ""dax"" gives green.
- ""walm"" being the fourth word results in the repetition of all the colors mentioned before it three times (considering ""walm"" as the last one would imply three repetitions).

Thus, the rule needs to consider all preceding color words.

Revised Rule: ""walm"" causes all preceding distinct color words to be repeated a number of times equal to its position in the input sequence.

If we dismantle Example 5 following this rule, we should see two instances of red, followed by three instances of green:

- ""wif"" results in red.
- ""bluf"" is associated with red too, but since there's already red from ""wif"", it does not result in an additional color.
- ""dax"" results in green.

Considering ""walm"" as the fourth word, we then repeat the distinct colors mentioned before it: red two times (""wif"" and ""bluf"" are the same color) and green three times (from ""dax""). Therefore, we have ""red red green green green"", which aligns with the output.

In conclusion, based on the provided examples:

walm -> Rule: ""walm"" causes all preceding distinct color words to be repeated a number of times equal to its position in the input sequence.",0.8,115,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to the output ""blue"" regardless of its position or neighboring words. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,116,lug
"Rule: lug -> blue

Each appearance of the word ""lug"" in the input results in the word ""blue"" in the corresponding position in the output.",1.0,116,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we will analyze the input and corresponding output to deduce the meaning or rule behind ""lug.""

- When ""lug"" appears after ""wif,"" the output is ""blue"" immediately after ""red.""
- When ""lug"" appears after ""walm,"" the output sequence is three ""blue.""
- When ""lug"" appears after ""zup,"" the output is ""blue"" immediately after ""yellow.""
- When ""lug"" appears after ""dax,"" the output is ""blue"" immediately after ""green.""
- When ""lug"" appears immediately after ""walm"" without any intermediate word, the output sequence is twice ""blue.""

In all cases, regardless of the preceding word, the appearance of ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue."" Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,116,lug

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds directly to the color ""green"" in every instance. Here is the rule that I have deduced:

Rule: dax -> green

The meaning is consistent regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the sequence or the other words that surround it.",1.0,116,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the rule that links the nonce word ""dax"" to a specific meaning in the outputs. Let's examine each input-output pair:

1. Input: dax zup dax zup wif
   Output: green yellow green yellow red
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

2. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red
   In this sequence, ""dax"" is ""green"" again, ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red.""

3. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
   Output: blue red red green blue blue

4. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   ""lug"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" aligns with ""green.""

5. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue
   ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""

Considering these input-output pairs, it's consistently observable that regardless of its position in the sequence, ""dax"" always results in the output ""green."" Therefore, the rule we can deduce for ""dax"" is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,116,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""dax"" by looking at what color it corresponds to in the output. Let's correlate each occurrence of ""dax"" to the output color:

1. dax zup dax zup wif -> green yellow green yellow red
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" here.

2. dax wif bluf -> green red red
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" again.

3. lug wif bluf dax lug bluf -> blue red red green blue blue
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" once more.

4. lug walm dax -> blue blue green
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" yet again.

5. dax lug -> green blue
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Every instance of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output. Based on these examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,116,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,116,dax
"Based on the given examples, it seems that there is a direct correlation between the nonce word ""dax"" and a particular color in the output. Across all examples, whenever ""dax"" is presented in the input, the output consistently shows ""green"". Observing the other words and their respective outputs, no other word correlates with ""green"" besides ""dax"". 

Therefore, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: ""dax"" -> ""green""",1.0,116,dax
"wif -> red

Rule: The word wif translates to the color red.",1.0,116,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,116,wif

"Based on the examples provided:

- The first example shows that ""wif"" precedes both ""red"" and ""blue"" colors in the output, but the context is not clear.
- The second example has ""wif"" preceding a ""red"" in the output, supporting the idea that ""wif"" could mean ""red"".
- The third example strengthens the hypothesis, as every instance of ""wif"" correlates with a ""red"" in the output, except for the last ""wif"" which is followed by a ""blue"". However, the presence of ""bluf"" before ""blue"" suggests that ""bluf"" may mean blue and ""wif"" introduces a ""red"".
- The fourth example has ""wif bluf"" corresponding to ""red red"". This supports that ""wif"" means ""red"" and ""bluf"" does not impact the meaning of ""wif"".
- The fifth example again confirms that ""wif"" matches with ""red"" regardless of following words.

Rule: wif -> red.",0.9,116,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" contributes to the output string by adding the word ""yellow"" at its position. To verify this, let's examine the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. wif zup walm dax zup -> red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
Here, ""wif"" and ""dax"" result in ""red"" and ""green,"" respectively. ""walm"" results in double ""yellow."" ""zup"" appears twice and there are two single ""yellow"" appearing in the output associated with each occurrence of ""zup.""

2. lug zup -> blue yellow
""lug"" results in ""blue,"" followed by ""zup,"" which results in ""yellow.""

3. wif walm zup lug zup walm -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
Here, ""wif"" and ""walm"" result in ""red"" and ""red red,"" while ""lug"" gives ""blue."" Each ""zup"" is followed by a single ""yellow,"" and an additional ""yellow"" follows the second ""walm,"" consistent with its previous output.

4. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
""zup"" is at the start and is followed by ""yellow,"" and ""walm,"" as before, results in double ""yellow.""

5. dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green
""dax"" results in green, followed by ""zup,"" which results in ""yellow,"" and then another ""dax"" followed by ""green."" The last ""walm"" once again leads to triple ""green.""

Accordingly, ""zup"" consistently adds a single ""yellow"" to the sequence, regardless of its position in the input string.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,116,zup
"From the given examples, we can infer a pattern in which the nonce word ""zup"" results in the word ""yellow"" being produced in the output:

- In the first example, ""wif zup walm dax zup,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" and ""dax"" both appear to correspond to ""yellow,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to another instance of ""yellow.""

- In the second example ""lug zup,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

- For the third example, ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" we see ""wif"" once more corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and both instances of ""zup"" as well as ""walm"" correspond to ""yellow.""

- The fourth example ""zup walm"" simply corresponds to three ""yellow.""

- The fifth example ""dax zup dax walm"" gives us ""green yellow green green green,"" showing that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" still continues to yield ""yellow,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Considering these evaluations, we can find a consistent result where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,116,zup
"Based on the given examples, we need to determine what the word ""zup"" means in terms of the color it corresponds to in the outputs. Here's what we can deduce from the patterns:

In every instance where ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" is present in the output. This direct correlation suggests that ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow. No other context seems to affect this association, as ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

Therefore, we can conclude the rule as:

zup -> ""yellow""

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears, it translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,116,zup
"Rule: ""zup"" when used within a sequence of words, causes the following word to be repeated in the output as many times as the contextual position of the word ""zup"". If ""zup"" appears as the first word, the next word is repeated once; if ""zup"" appears as the second word, the following word is repeated twice; and so on.

Examples:

- In the first input, ""zup"" appears as the second and fourth words. Therefore, ""walm"" which follows the first ""zup"" is repeated twice (yielding two ""yellow"" outputs), and ""dax"" which follows the second ""zup"" is repeated four times (yielding four ""yellow"" outputs).

- In the second input, ""zup"" appears as the second word, which means ""lug"" (translated as ""blue"") is repeated twice.

- In the third input, ""zup"" is third and fifth, resulting in ""lug"" after the first ""zup"" being repeated three times, and ""walm"" after the second ""zup"" being repeated five times.

- In the fourth input, ""zup"" is the first word, meaning ""walm"" is repeated only once.

- In the fifth input, ""zup"" is second and has ""dax"" after it, which is then repeated twice.

So, ""zup"" -> Rule: Repeat the following word in the output as many times as the position of ""zup"" in the sequence.",0.8,116,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" causes a repetition of the color that follows it in the sequence. Notably, ""zup"" seems to make the next word's output repeat until a new color word is introduced to change the pattern.

Let's examine each example to extract the relationship:

1. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   - The word 'red' is represented by 'wif'. After 'zup', 'walm' which is 'yellow', repeats until 'dax' (green).

2. Input: lug zup
   Output: blue yellow
   - The word 'blue' is represented by 'lug'. 'Zup' is followed by no color word, but we can presume it would repeat 'yellow' if it were present.

3. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - The word 'red' is represented by both 'wif' and 'walm' initially. After the second 'zup', 'lug' (blue) switches the color, followed by another 'walm' (red) which is repeated.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - 'Zup' comes before any color word, but 'walm' (yellow) is repeated.

5. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   - The word 'green' is represented by 'dax'. After 'zup', the color 'green' repeats until 'walm' (yellow) is introduced, which is not repeated, suggesting 'zup' influenced only the initial 'dax'.

Given this analysis, we can infer the rule:

Rule: zup -> causes the following color word to repeat until a new color word is introduced. If 'zup' is at the beginning, it causes the first color word to repeat.

Please keep in mind that this rule is induced based on the provided examples. If more context or examples were provided, the understanding of 'zup' could change accordingly.",0.8,116,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be a function that replicates the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. We can derive this rule from observing the pattern of outputs corresponding to the word that comes before ""bluf"" in each input:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow,"" followed by the color blue for ""lug.""
- In the third example, we see ""dax"" before ""bluf"" again, leading to ""green green,"" followed by blue for ""lug"" and red for ""wif.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" again, yielding ""yellow yellow,"" with subsequent colors matching their associated words (""wif"" is red, ""dax"" is green, and ""zup"" is yellow).
- Finally, the fifth example shows ""lug"" before ""bluf,"" resulting in ""blue blue,"" in line with the established rule.

"Observing the examples provided:

1. When the input sentence contains the word ""walm,"" each color word that follows it is tripled in the output.
2. If ""walm"" appears after a color word in the input, the output color word corresponding to that input color word is tripled.
3. If ""walm"" appears alone after ""dax,"" it results in ""green"" being repeated three times.

Assessment of each input-output pair:

- Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
  Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
  The word ""wif"" results in ""red,"" while ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" and ""zup"" results in ""yellow."" When ""walm"" appears, the previously mentioned color is repeated two more times, leading to three instances of that color overall.

- Input: dax walm
  Output: green green green
  The word ""dax"" translates to ""green."" After ""walm"" appears, ""green"" is repeated twice more, totaling three times.

- Input: lug walm wif bluf
  Output: blue blue blue red red
  The word ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" After ""walm"" appears, ""blue"" is repeated twice more, totaling three times. ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" which appears twice due to ""bluf"" in the input, but ""bluf"" does not seem to relate directly to ""walm.""

- Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
  Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
  The word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" After ""walm"" appears, ""yellow"" is repeated twice more, totaling three times. The pattern continues with other colors accordingly.

- Input: zup dax walm zup wif
  Output: yellow green green green yellow red
  The words ""zup"" and ""dax"" translate to ""yellow"" and ""green"" respectively. After ""walm"" appears, ""green"" is repeated twice more, totaling three times.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that the word ""walm"" causes the color word that precedes it to be outputted two additional times, making the color appear a total of three times consecutively. If ""walm"" appears with no preceding color word, it repeats the color word of the preceding color-associated word three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"":
Walm -> Causes the preceding color word to be outputted two additional times, totaling three consecutive instances of that color. If ""walm"" stands alone following a word that translates to a color, that color is outputted three times.",1.0,116,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to influence the output by repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here is the mapping from the examples:

- ""dax wif walm"" translates to ""green red red""
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green""
- ""lug walm wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue""
- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow""

The word following ""walm"" does not appear to influence the result, as ""walm"" only repeats the color corresponding to the word right before it. The number of ""walm"" repetitions in the output matches the number of times ""walm"" appears in the input consecutively.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word for the number of times ""walm"" appears consecutively.",1.0,116,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the color outputs as they correspond to the other words in the examples:

1. The word ""dax"" leads to the output ""green,"" except in the presence of ""walm,"" where all the subsequent colors are green regardless of other words until a different color word like ""zup"" is mentioned.
2. The word ""lug"" leads to the output ""blue,"" except when followed by ""walm,"" then the subsequent colors are blue until a different color word appears.
3. The word ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" except after ""walm"" where it continues as red multiple times.
4. The word ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" except when followed by ""walm,"" with all subsequent colors being yellow until interrupted by another color word.
5. ""Bluf"" leads to the color ""red"" in its sole appearance, not appearing with ""walm.""

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color output to repeat the color of the last word said right before ""walm,"" and it continues to repeat that color until a new color word is introduced.

Rule: walm -> causes the previous color to repeat until a new color word is introduced.",1.0,116,walm
"Based on the examples provided, I will analyze each instance of ""walm"" and the corresponding output:

1. Example one suggests that ""walm"" following ""lug"" leads to a repetition of ""red"" and following ""zup"" leads to the repetition of ""yellow"".

2. Example two demonstrates that when ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the output is repeated ""green"".

3. Example three indicates that ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output is repeated ""blue"".

4. Example four gives an example of ""walm"" following ""zup"" which results in repeated ""yellow"". When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the output is the color attributed to ""dax"", which is ""green"".

5. Example five repeats the pattern of ""walm"" following ""dax"" and ""zup"", leading to repeated ""green"" and ""yellow"" respectively.

From these examples, I can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color of the word that precedes it to be repeated an extra two times beyond the usual one time.

Therefore:

walm -> Rule: Repeat the color attributed to the previous word twice more.",0.9,116,walm
"To solve this, we need to find a pattern in the given examples that can help us deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm."" Let's analyze the inputs in relation to their corresponding outputs:

1. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the outputs are all green.
2. When ""walm"" is on its own after ""dax"" or with no preceding word mentioned, ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color assigned to the previous word.
3. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the outputs are blue.
4. When ""walm"" appears after ""zup,"" the outputs are yellow.

This leads us to a potential rule that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately before it. The number of repetitions could be based on how many occurrences there are of ""walm"" after the preceding word, or a fixed number if ""walm"" follows on its own.

Based on this analysis, the rule behind ""walm"" seems to be repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes before it. If ""walm"" is standalone or immediately follows ""dax,"" it appears to just be green.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color assigned to the preceding word. If ""walm"" follows ""dax"" or stands alone, the color is green.",0.8,116,walm

"Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Here's how it is deduced:

- In every instance where ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Here's the rule: dax -> green.",1.0,117,dax
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"", let's look at how it affects the output in each example:

- Every time “wif” appears in the input, “red” is the corresponding output color.
- The word “wif” doesn’t seem to affect the output of the words that follow it in any distinguishable pattern.

Now, let's briefly analyze the other recurring words in the context of their outputs:

- “zup” consistently leads to the output “yellow.”
- “walm” results in a sequence of “yellow” colors equal to the number of times it has appeared in sequence plus one. For instance, one ""walm"" results in two ""yellow"" outputs, but when it is preceded by ""wif"", the sequence starts with ""red"" followed by ""yellow"" colors.
- “dax” leads to the output “green.”
- “lug” maps to the output “blue.”

Given the observed pattern for ""wif"", we can articulate the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""wif"" as follows:

Rule: wif -> The word ""wif"" maps to ""red"" in the output, irrespective of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,117,wif
"Observing the provided examples, I notice the following patterns:

1. Every instance of ""wif"" in the input results in a ""red"" in the corresponding position in the output.
2. Other words in the inputs such as ""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" correspond to different colors in the output.

Thus, it seems that each word has a distinct color associated with it. With the word ""wif"" consistently correlating with the color ""red"" in the outputs, we can deduce:

Rule: wif -> ""red""",1.0,117,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's examine the relationship between the inputs and outputs across all examples.

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

This input suggests that ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow,"" and since ""walm"" follows ""wif"" with ""red"" repeating, it could indicate that ""wif"" combined with ""walm"" results in multiple ""red.""

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

Here, ""dax"" correlates to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"" as seen in previous examples. ""Lug"" results in ""blue"" and is reinforced as proceeding ""wif"" causes ""blue"" to repeat. Again, ""wif"" preceding ""walm"" results in repeating ""red"".

Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

""Wif"" leads with ""red,"" followed by ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" ""blue"" for ""lug,"" and ""green"" for ""dax."" ""Walm"" comes last with repeated ""yellow,"" but not following ""wif"" this time.

Input: dax lug wif
Output: green blue red

Here ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is singularly ""red.""

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

Following the previous pattern, ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" ""Walm"" is ""yellow,"" showing that it doesn't always result in repetitions after ""wif.""

By comparing these examples, one can infer the rule that ""wif"" relates to the color ""red."" In the first and second inputs, ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" leads to a repeated ""red."" In other cases, ""wif"" by itself or not followed by ""walm"" results in a single ""red."" The rule for ""wif"" seems to be that it always results in ""red,"" with an additional repetition effect when it precedes ""walm.""

Rule: wif -> when by itself or not followed by ""walm,"" it means ""red."" When followed by ""walm,"" it results in repeated ""red.""",0.9,117,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following patterns for each word:

- ""zup"" always results in ""yellow""
- ""walm"" always results in a sequence of ""red red red"" or ""yellow yellow yellow"" depending on its position relative to ""wif""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- When ""wif"" appears, it translates to ""red,"" and the word that follows ""wif"" is repeated as many times as the color that word represents.

Applying these patterns, we can induce the following rule for ""wif"":

wif -> When ""wif"" appears, it translates to red, and also causes the word following it to repeat its assigned color corresponding to the number of times that color is represented in the pattern.

Rule: The word ""wif"" means red, and it also triggers the repetition effect for the subsequent word's color representation.",0.9,117,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the rule governing the output of the colors for each input word. Let's note what comes after each occurrence of ""wif"" and what color it corresponds to:

1. First example: ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
2. Second example: ""wif walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue"", ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
3. Third example: ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""
4. Fourth example: ""wif"" (only word) -> ""red""
5. Fifth example: ""wif dax"" -> ""red green"", ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""

From these examples, it appears that ""wif"" by itself always translates to ""red."" Wherever ""wif"" precedes another word, the first output related to ""wif"" is ""red,"" regardless of the second word. 

Let's look further into the sequences after ""wif:""

- For ""wif walm,"" the output is ""red"" followed by a sequence of the color ""red"" repeating for the number of letters in ""walm"" (four letters -> three additional ""red"").
- For ""wif lug,"" we see the output is ""red"" followed by the color corresponding to ""lug"" (""blue"").
- For ""wif zup,"" we see ""red yellow,"" with ""yellow"" being the color for ""zup.""
- For ""wif dax,"" it is ""red green,"" with ""green"" being the color for ""dax.""

It appears that ""wif"" on its own or at the end of a sequence always results in ""red,"" while ""wif"" followed by another word results in ""red"" plus the color corresponding to the next word or the sequence of colors for the subsequent word. 

Therefore, based on these analyses, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and if followed by another word, it also triggers a sequence of colors beginning with ""red.""

Rule: wif -> leads to ""red,"" and if another word follows, the output starts with ""red"" followed by that particular word’s corresponding sequence of colors.",0.8,117,wif

"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" Every instance where ""bluf"" appears, the following pattern can be observed:

- ""dax bluf"" outputs ""green green,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" may also mean ""green.""
- ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow red green red red,"" and here ""bluf"" seems to follow ""wif,"" which has already been established as ""red,"" so ""bluf"" may take on the color of the preceding word.
- ""zup bluf wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow red red,"" which also suggests that ""bluf"" assumes the color of the preceding word ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- ""dax bluf wif"" outputs ""green green red,"" again showing ""bluf"" as ""green,"" following the color of ""dax.""
- ""zup wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow red red,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""

Considering these observations, we can conclude that the nonce word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the immediately preceding word.

Rule: bluf means the same as the color word before it. If there is no color word before, then it defaults to red, as seen in the second example where ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" which is red.

bluf -> the same color as the preceding color word (default to red if there's no preceding color word).",0.9,117,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following rule for the meaning of the word ""bluf"":

When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""green green"".
When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red"".
When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", and they are not separated by ""wif"", the output is ""yellow yellow"".

A consistent pattern is that the word ""bluf"" by itself, regardless of what comes before or after, corresponds to ""red"". However, in combination with ""dax"" and ""zup"", it appears that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with these words (""green"" for ""dax"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup"") and then repeats that color.

To summarize:

bluf -> red, except when combined with specific words where it takes the color of the preceding word and repeats it.

Rule: ""bluf"" outputs a color. When preceded by ""dax"" outputs ""green green"", when preceded by ""zup"" outputs ""yellow yellow"", and when following ""wif"" or on its own it outputs ""red red"".",0.9,117,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can start by looking for patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs. First, let's list each input example along with its associated output:

1. dax bluf -> green green
2. zup wif dax wif bluf -> yellow red green red red
3. zup bluf wif bluf -> yellow yellow red red
4. dax bluf wif -> green green red
5. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red

We start by identifying the consistent relations:

- Every instance of ""dax"" is followed by ""green"".
- Every instance of ""wif"" is followed by ""red"".
- Every instance of ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow"".

Now, it's critical to determine what ""bluf"" corresponds to by its position and context:

- In example 1, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" suggesting ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" when following ""dax"".
- In example 2, ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red green red red,"" and here ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is always ""red"". However, we cannot yet confirm if ""bluf"" is also ""red"" because it could be that ""bluf"" is repeating the color of the word before it, ""dax,"" which is ""green"".
- In example 3, ""zup bluf wif bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow red red."" This could imply that ""bluf"" is repeating the color of the word before it - in this case, ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In example 4, ""dax bluf wif"" translates to ""green green red,"" which again suggests that ""bluf"" might be repeating the color of the preceding word, ""dax,"" making it ""green"" before being followed by ""red"" from ""wif"".
- In example 5, ""zup wif bluf"" becomes ""yellow red red."" Here again, ""bluf"" seems to be repeating the color of the previous word, ""wif,"" which is ""red"".

Given this information, it appears that ""bluf"" represents the color of the word immediately before it. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word immediately before it.

Now let's translate this understanding into the requested format:

bluf -> meaning. The nonce word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"".

For confirmation:

1. In ""dax bluf"" (example 1), ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is ""green"".
2. In ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" (example 2), ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red"".
3. In ""zup bluf wif bluf"" (example 3), the first ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" and the second ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red"".
4. In ""dax bluf wif"" (example 4), ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is ""green"".
5. In ""zup wif bluf"" (example 5), ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red"".",0.9,117,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we must look for patterns associated with this word in the given examples. We need to compare the inputs containing the word ""bluf"" with their corresponding outputs and identify any consistent correlations or rules.

From the provided set:

1. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
2. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow red green red red
3. Input: zup bluf wif bluf -> Output: yellow yellow red red
4. Input: dax bluf wif -> Output: green green red
5. Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red

Looking at the outputs, we can make the following observations related to ""bluf"":

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears immediately after ""dax,"" the output is ""green green."" (Example 1 & 4)
- Whenever ""bluf"" appears immediately after ""wif,"" the output is ""red red."" (Example 2 & 5)
- Whenever ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow red."" (Example 3, where ""bluf"" appears twice and produces two reds)

Additionally, this word ""bluf"" consistently leads to the output color ""red"" appearing at least once. Considering these patterns, it seems like ""bluf"" acts as a duplicator of the color associated with the word preceding it with a potential default to red when the preceding pattern is unclear or has no established color.

Rule: ""bluf"" replicates the color output associated with the immediately preceding word. If the preceding word is ""dax,"" the resulting color is ""green."" If the preceding word is ""wif,"" the resulting color is ""red."" If ""bluf"" is used after ""zup,"" the pattern suggests an output of ""yellow red,"" and with a second ""bluf,"" the pattern repeats the second color, ""red.""

bluf -> meaning: Duplicate the color output of the preceding word, with a tendency to default to the color ""red"" if the preceding word's color association is not established.",0.8,117,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by examining the output each time ""bluf"" is used in the input:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" maps to ""green green."" ""Dax"" therefore corresponds to the first ""green,"" implying ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green.""
- In the second example, ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" maps to ""yellow red green red red."" By comparing with the first example, it's clear that ""dax"" continues to correspond to ""green,"" so the final ""red"" must correspond to ""bluf,"" given that ""wif"" appears twice before ""bluf"" and corresponds to two ""red"" outputs.
- In the third example, ""zup bluf wif bluf"" maps to ""yellow yellow red red."" The first ""yellow"" corresponds to ""zup,"" and it seems that ""bluf"" here must correspond to the second ""yellow,"" with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"" as in other examples.
- In the fourth example, ""dax bluf wif"" maps to ""green green red."" As before, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" must correspond to the remaining ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup wif bluf"" maps to ""yellow red red."" ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and therefore ""bluf"" must correspond to the other ""red.""

After analyzing the examples, it's not entirely clear what concrete meaning ""bluf"" has because its corresponding output changes between ""green"" and ""red."" However, one might deduce that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately preceding it:

- When ""dax"" (green) precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green.""
- When ""wif"" (red) precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red.""
- However, this rule does not hold for ""zup bluf,"" where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" instead of repeating ""yellow"" from ""zup.""

Since the pattern is not conclusively consistent, the rule of ""bluf"" taking on the color of the preceding word does not fully explain its meaning. The rule may be affected by other aspects not immediately apparent in the examples given.

Given the conflicting information, the best hypothesis with the given data is that ""bluf"" tends to repeat the color of the previous word, but there may be exceptions or additional rules affecting its meaning that are not clear from the provided examples.

Rule: bluf -> likely repeats the color of the preceding word, but there are inconsistencies suggesting additional rules or exceptions may be at play.",0.6,117,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond to repeating the color of the word that precedes it, three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,117,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word, for as many times as ""walm"" has been said consecutively. Let's examine the patterns:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green."" Since ""dax"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""green,"" it appears that ""walm"" is causing ""green"" to be said three times.
- In the second example, ""wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""red blue green green green."" Again, ""green"" is repeated three times after ""dax,"" which indicates ""walm"" is causing this repetition.
- In the third and fourth examples, we see similar patterns: ""wif walm dax zup"" leads to ""red red red green yellow,"" and ""red"" is repeated three times after ""wif,"" just like in the previous examples with ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm wif walm"" leads to ""green green green red red red."" Here, the first ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times and the second ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times after ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,117,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the input-output pairs.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

The word ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the output is ""green"" repeated three times.

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green

Here, ""dax"" is again followed by ""walm,"" resulting in ""green green green."" The words ""wif"" and ""lug"" correlate with ""red"" and ""blue,"" respectively.

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

The word ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" this time, and the output is ""red"" repeated three times.

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red

Following the word ""wif,"" ""walm"" appears and the output is ""red"" repeated three times.

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red

In this example, ""walm"" follows both ""dax"" and ""wif,"" and the sequence of colors repeats ""green"" three times and ""red"" three times corresponding to the words that precede ""walm.""

From these examples, we can induce the following rule:

walm -> meaning. Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it three times.

So, if ""dax"" is before ""walm,"" the output is ""green"" repeated three times, and if ""wif"" is before ""walm,"" the output is ""red"" repeated three times.",0.9,117,walm
"Analyzing the examples given, we attempt to isolate the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""walm."" Examining each instance of ""walm"" in the input and its corresponding output:

- Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
- Input: dax lug wif walm -> Output: green blue red red red
- Input: dax walm wif walm -> Output: green green green red red red

Every occurrence of ""walm"" in the output is followed by a series of the word ""red."" The number of repetitions of ""red"" matches the number of times ""walm"" occurs. Additionally, the first color in the output sequence is always directly related to the word preceding ""walm."" Therefore, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

walm -> The output for ""walm"" is a series of ""red"" equal in number to the occurrences of ""walm."" In addition, ""walm"" also repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it in the sequence.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears x times in the input, it results in one output instance of the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm,"" followed by x instances of the color ""red.""",0.8,117,walm
"Based on the examples given, we can see a pattern that correlates the presence of the word ""walm"" and the repetition of colors in the output. Here's the pattern I observe:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red.""
- No example shows ""walm"" following ""lug"" or ""zup,"" so we can't determine its effect after these words.

From these examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" when following a particular word, causes the color associated with that word to be repeated three times in the output.

Hence, the rule appears to be as follows:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: If ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" output three greens. If ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" output three reds. The effect of ""walm"" after other words cannot be determined with the given examples.",0.8,117,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever we see ""lug"" in the input, it corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,118,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rules for the nonce word ""lug"":

- In the first example, ""dax lug dax lug wif"" translates to ""green blue green blue red."" It is evident that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The word ""lug"" appears between them, which translates to ""blue.""

- In the second example, ""zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue."" Here ""zup"" must translate to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" does not seem related to ""lug,"" as ""bluf"" does not have a corresponding output (or it may translate to ""yellow"" as well, but we cannot confirm from this single instance). Hence, ""lug"" remains ""blue.""

- In the third example, ""zup lug walm wif walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue red red red."" ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Both ""lug"" and ""walm"" translate to ""blue.""

- The fourth example, ""wif lug walm,"" which translates to ""red blue blue blue,"" suggests again that ""lug"" and ""walm"" translate to ""blue.""

- The fifth example, ""dax lug,"" translates to ""green blue."" This confirms that ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""lug"" is ""blue"" once more.

From these examples, we can deduce the consistent rule that the nonce word ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" Therefore:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,118,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,118,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that lug is a nonce word being used to indicate a transition in color sequences. The pattern that emerges from the examples associates lug with the color blue, but the rule seems a bit more complex than lug representing just one color. Instead, it appears that the color blue is repeated after lug an amount of times equal to the number of times the last color before lug was mentioned.

Here's the rule induction based on the given examples:

1. Input: dax lug dax lug wif
   Output: green blue green blue red
   Rule: dax -> green, lug following a single dax results in a single blue.

2. Input: zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue
   Rule: zup -> yellow, bluf -> yellow (from context), lug following two yellows results in a single blue.

3. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   Rule: zup -> yellow, lug introduces two blues after one yellow, wif -> red, walm after one wif continues to repeat red.

4. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   Rule: wif -> red, lug introduces three blues after one red, walm would likely repeat red (consistent with previous example) but is not explicitly shown.

5. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue
   Rule: dax -> green, lug follows with a single blue, as with the first example.

Thus, the rule induced for lug is that it translates to the color blue being repeated as many times as the preceding color word was mentioned before lug. 

Rule:
lug -> Repeat the color blue the same number of times as the last color word was mentioned before lug.",1.0,118,lug
"Given the examples provided, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue."" It does not seem to modify or change according to context; it's a direct one-to-one translation from ""lug"" to ""blue."" In each example, regardless of the surrounding words, ""lug"" is replaced by ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,118,lug
"dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence. 

Based on the input-output pairs, it seems that other words might correspond to other colors. ""wif"" seems to be associated with the color red, ""bluf"" with green, ""zup"" with yellow, and ""lug"" with blue. However, since the task is to deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" the rule that ""dax"" means green holds, irrespective of other words present in the sequence.",1.0,118,dax
dax -> green. Rule: The word 'dax' corresponds to the color green. Each occurrence of 'dax' results in the color green in the output.,1.0,118,dax
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Other words in the examples correspond to different colors. The word ""walm"" is followed by green in the output (except when preceded by ""dax""), and ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". The word ""bluf"" appears to correspond to green as well, except it is not clear why it is not simply ""dax"". Without further examples, it's challenging to determine the exact rule for ""bluf"". The word ""lug"" relates to the color ""blue"".

Rule:
- dax -> green
- walm (when not preceded by dax) -> green
- bluf -> green (the rule for ""bluf"" is uncertain without more examples)
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue",0.9,118,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" This can be observed as the consistent output whenever the input includes ""dax."" The other words, ""walm,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" translate to ""green,"" ""green,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue"" respectively, which suggests that each of these nonce words corresponds to a color.

The mappings appear to be as follows:
- ""dax"" -> ""green""
- ""walm"" -> ""green""
- ""bluf"" -> ""green""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""

However, it is interesting to note that in the sequence ""dax walm wif dax,"" the word ""wif"" transforms the next occurrence of ""dax"" into ""red"" instead of ""green."" While there isn't enough information to fully understand the rule for ""wif,"" a preliminary hypothesis could be:

- ""wif"" maybe indicates changing the color of the following occurrence of ""dax"" to ""red.""

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" but its color can be modified to ""red"" if preceded immediately by ""wif."" Other context specific rules may apply to ""wif"" but cannot be confirmed without further examples.",0.9,118,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look for patterns in its appearances and the corresponding output colors. By examining the examples provided, we can attempt to construct the rules governing the output:

- When ""dax"" appears alone, the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and ""wif"" with another ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green red green."" Here, it seems every instance of ""dax"" results in ""green,"" except when it is preceded by ""wif.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green,"" suggesting ""bluf"" might also correspond to ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf zup,"" the output is ""green green yellow,"" this shows that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm zup lug,"" the output is ""green green green yellow blue,"" suggesting that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" may have no impact on changing the color or can be assumed to be potentially another instance of ""green.""

With these observations, we can state the following rule:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" The words following ""dax"" determine other colors in the sequence, with ""bluf"" likely corresponding to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The word ""wif"" changes the color output to ""red"" when it precedes ""dax."" The word ""walm"" does not seem to affect the color output and may signify a repetition of the color denoted by the preceding word (in these cases, ""green"").",0.8,118,dax
"Using the provided examples, we can try to deduce what ""wif"" means in relation to the output colors.

1. Input: zup bluf wif -> Output: yellow yellow red
2. Input: wif -> Output: red
3. Input: zup walm wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow red
4. Input: wif dax -> Output: red green
5. Input: lug zup dax wif zup -> Output: blue yellow green red yellow

Analyzing these examples, it seems that every occurrence of ""wif"" within an input is associated with the output color ""red."" No matter the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence, the output sequence always contains ""red"" in the position that corresponds to where ""wif"" appeared. This implies that ""wif"" correlates directly with the color ""red.""

Based on this analysis, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Therefore, wif -> red.",1.0,118,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color red, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,118,wif

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,118,wif
Rule: wif translates to the color red.,1.0,118,wif
"Based on the usage of the word 'wif' in the provided examples, we can induce the following rule:

- In every instance where 'wif' is used, the output is 'red'.
- 'wif' does not depend on its position in the input sequence to determine its output.
- 'wif' seems to be consistent in its meaning regardless of the surrounding words.

Considering these points, the rule that 'wif' represents can be deduced as:

"Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to link the nonce word ""zup"" to the color ""yellow"". Every instance of ""zup"" results in the word ""yellow"" being output. Additional words such as ""bluf"" and ""lug"" map to other colors (""bluf"" to yellow, and ""lug"" to blue), and ""walm"" seems to act as a repetition of the preceding color, in this case, ""yellow"" since it follows ""zup"".

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".",1.0,118,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,118,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to repeating the color that corresponds with the word just before it. We can deduce this because every time ""bluf"" is used in an example, the color that is outputted after ""bluf"" is the same as the color that is outputted for the word that precedes ""bluf"". 

Here is the breakdown for each example:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"", and the word after ""bluf"" is ""red"" again.
- In the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and after ""bluf"" we see ""red"" repeated.
- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and after ""bluf"" we see ""green"" once more.
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and after ""bluf"" we see ""yellow"" repeated.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so after ""bluf"" we see ""yellow"", and after a second instance of ""bluf"", we still see ""yellow"".

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,118,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before ""bluf"". If ""bluf"" is the first word or no previous word indicates a color, default to yellow.",1.0,118,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the term ""bluf"" indicates repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. 

For instance:
- In the first example, ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" and when ""bluf"" follows, ""red"" is repeated.
- In the second example, ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" and following ""bluf"" causes ""red"" to repeat.
- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" following it leads to ""green"" repeating.
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the first ""bluf"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated, then ""lug"" seems to reset the color to ""blue,"" but then there is a return to ""zup,"" which correlates to ""yellow"" and it's followed by ""walm,"" which seems to be a further repetition of ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> The color of the word just before it is repeated.",0.8,118,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the word that precedes it, with one exception: when ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" it translates to ""blue."" In all other cases, ""bluf"" takes on the meaning of the word that comes immediately before it. Here is the induction of the rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" equals the color corresponding to the word before it, except when preceded by ""lug,"" in which case ""bluf"" equals ""blue.""

Given that:
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> (no given color, but ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue"" directly)

The conclusion is:
bluf -> the same color as the previous word, except when following ""lug"" where bluf equals blue.",0.8,118,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".",0.0,118,bluf
"Considering the examples given, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be linked to repeating the color associated with the word that comes directly before it. Each example shows ""walm"" outputting multiple instances of the color word that directly precedes it.

In more detail:

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red"". ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" creates two more instances of ""red"".
- In the second example, ""dax lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", so following ""walm"" we get three more instances of ""blue"".
- In the third example, ""dax wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" results in three additional instances of ""red"".
- In the fourth example, the last ""lug"" before ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" causes three more ""blue"" to appear.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""walm"" produces three more ""green"".

Thus the rule seems to be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color given by the word that comes directly before it three times.",1.0,118,walm
"To determine the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's first look at the constant element in both the inputs and outputs: the word ""walm"" and repetition of colors in the outputs.

- Input: wif walm
  Output: red red red
  
- Input: dax lug walm
  Output: green blue blue blue
  
- Input: dax wif walm
  Output: green red red red
  
- Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
  Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
  
- Input: dax walm
  Output: green green green
  
Observing the repetition of colors in the output and the position of ""walm"" at the end of each input sequence, it seems that ""walm"" indicates repeating the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" for a count equal to the number of letters in the word that precedes ""walm.""

Applying this rule:

- ""wif walm"" becomes ""red red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""wif"" has three letters.
- ""dax lug walm"" becomes ""green blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""lug"" has three letters.
- ""dax wif walm"" becomes ""green red red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""wif"" has three letters.
- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" becomes ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""lug"" has three letters; hence ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- ""dax walm"" becomes ""green green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""dax"" has three letters.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Rule: Repeat the color corresponding to the word just before ""walm"" for a number of times equal to the number of letters in that word.",1.0,118,walm
"From the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to have a rule associated with its meaning that depends on the word that precedes it. Let's examine each input/output pair to deduce the rule.

- Input: wif walm / Output: red red red
  Apparently, ""wif"" translates to a single ""red,"" and thus ""walm"" repeated that color three times.

- Input: dax lug walm / Output: green blue blue blue
  ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" The word ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""lug"" three times.

- Input: dax wif walm / Output: green red red red
  Again, ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" so ""walm"" repeats the ""red"" three times as it follows ""wif.""

- Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug / Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
  ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""bluf"" has no direct translation but does not seem to affect ""walm,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" therefore ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times.

- Input: dax walm / Output: green green green
  ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""walm"" here repeats the ""green"" color three times.

Based on the observations above, the word ""walm"" when following another word causes the output to be the color associated with that word repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Act as a multiplier for the color associated with the immediately preceding word, repeating that color three times in the output.",1.0,118,walm
"From the given examples, we can deduce the rule as follows:

- Each word corresponds to a color.

1. Input: wif walm

3. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   Rule Observed: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". ""Walm"" after ""wif"" repeats ""red"" three times because ""wif"" has three letters, and ""dax"" is ""green.""

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Rule Observed: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" ""Walm"" after ""zup"" repeats ""yellow"" three times because ""zup"" has three letters, and the other words have their corresponding colors as ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""bluf"" is not directly corresponding to any color, and ""dax"" is ""green.""

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Rule Observed: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" ""Walm"" after ""dax"" repeats ""green"" three times because ""dax"" has three letters.

Based on these observations, we can conclude:

"From the given examples, we can observe that the word ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it three times, except when the word ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" where it repeats the corresponding color four times. Here's the breakdown based on the examples:

- ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue"" indicates that ""walm"" means repeating ""blue"" four times, as ""lug"" precedes ""walm.""
- ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red"" indicates that ""walm"" means repeating ""red"" three times, since ""wif"" precedes ""walm.""
- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"" suggests that ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" and ""walm"" means repeating ""yellow"" three times, followed by ""blue"" once for the final ""lug.""

"From the examples given, we can deduce a pattern for the output colors corresponding to each word, including ""bluf."" 

Firstly, notice that every occurrence of ""bluf"" corresponds to double ""red"" in the output:

- In the second example, ""bluf"" is at the end and the output ends with ""red red.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is positioned fifth, and the fifth and sixth colors in the output are ""red red.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is in the third position, and the third and fourth colors in the output are ""green green,"" but considering the previous examples, we could assume that ""green"" was a mistake and it should be ""red red"" to fit the established pattern.

- ""zup"" -> ""yellow"" (seen in examples 1, 3, and 4)
- ""dax"" -> ""green"" (seen in examples 1, 2, and 5)
- ""wif"" -> ""red"" (seen in examples 2 and 5)
- ""lug"" -> ""blue"" (seen in examples 4 and 5)
- ""walm"" -> ""yellow"" (seen in example 4)

Applying all these observed correspondences, we draw the following conclusion for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to two occurrences of ""red"" in the output.

Representation: bluf -> red red",0.8,119,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"", we need to analyze the patterns in the given examples and their corresponding outputs. Let's look at the occurrences of ""bluf"" and the color it is matched with in each output:

1. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
2. dax wif bluf -> green red red
3. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
4. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
5. lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> blue green green yellow blue red

From the first and the third inputs and outputs, we can see that ""bluf"" directly corresponds to the color green. However, in the second, fourth, and fifth examples, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red. This inconsistency in color associations indicates that the meaning of ""bluf"" might be context-dependent.

Let's explore a potential rule by analyzing other words and their consistent color matches:

- ""zup"" always produces yellow.
- ""dax"" always produces green when it's at the beginning or middle of the sequence, but not necessarily when it appears right after ""bluf"".
- ""wif"" always produces red.
- ""lug"" typically produces blue, but not consistently when following ""bluf"".
- ""walm"" produces yellow in the one instance it's used.

Now, let's check if ""bluf"" could be a function of its position or surrounding words:

- In examples 1 and 3, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""dax"", resulting in green.
- In example 2, ""bluf"" is at the end and follows ""wif"", resulting in red.
- In example 4, ""bluf"" is at the end again but produces red despite following different words.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" is in the middle, follows ""dax"", and is followed by ""zup"" and results in green.

From this, we can induce that ""bluf"" might result in the color red when it is at the end of the sequence, regardless of the preceding words. When it is not at the end, it seems to take on the color green.

Therefore, the rule could be:
Rule: If ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence, it outputs red; otherwise, it outputs green.

Applying this rule:
bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" generally results in green, unless it is at the end of a sequence, in which case it results in red.",0.8,119,bluf
"To induce the rules for what ""bluf"" means, let's examine the patterns before and after it appears, along with the corresponding outputs:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output color is green.
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output color is red.
3. In the case of the word ""bluf"" being in the middle of the sentence, we will break it down:
    - In ""zup walm lug wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" results in ""red,"" and ""red"" occurs after ""wif,"" so it seems consistent with example 2.
    - In ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" which results in green, consistent with example 1's pairing of ""zup"" and green. 

Based on this analysis, the rule seems to focus on the word that is immediately in front of ""bluf."" Specifically, the pattern indicates that:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is green.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red.

Therefore, the most consistent rule that can be induced from these examples is that ""bluf"" results in a color that is determined by the word immediately preceding it. However, due to a limited dataset, the exact rule for what ""bluf"" means in relation to other preceding words cannot be determined without further examples or additional context.

Rule: ""Bluf"" takes on the color output associated with the word immediately preceding it: green after ""zup"" and red after ""wif"".",0.8,119,bluf
"Rule: 

The word ""walm"" seems to correlate with a sequence of three ""red"" colors in the output. 

Every input that contains the word ""walm"" corresponds to an output with ""red red red"" consecutively, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to observe each instance where it appears and the corresponding output:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   
2. Input: zup wif walm

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm

4. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   
5. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red

Looking at the outputs, ""walm"" consistently corresponds to three reds in sequence. In every instance, regardless of the other words present, the appearance of the nonce word ""walm"" results in ""red red red.""

Hence, we can deduce that:

walm -> three consecutive ""red"" outputs. Rule: When you see ""walm,"" output ""red red red.""",1.0,119,walm

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green
4. Input: zup wif dax walm lug -> Output: yellow red green green green blue
5. Input: lug wif walm -> Output: blue red red red

Comparing the inputs with their outputs:

- The word ""walm"" always corresponds to a series of reds followed by a green.
- The first red in the ""walm"" output pattern seems to be linked to the word ""wif,"" which is found before ""walm"" every time.
- Each additional word before ""walm"" adds one red to the output.

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" translates to a sequence of ""red"" colors in the output equivalent to the number of words preceding ""walm,"" followed by a ""green.""

Analyzing the association of ""bluf"" across different examples:

In the first input, ""bluf"" occurs twice and each time the word ""bluf"" is followed by the color ""red"", which corresponds to the word ""wif"".

The word ""bluf"" seems to precede a color that corresponds to the next word in the sequence. Therefore, its rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" predicts the color of the following word.

- When ""walm"" appears after ""zup"", the output is three yellows.
- When ""walm"" appears after ""dax"", the output is three greens.
- When ""walm"" appears after ""lug"", the output is three blues.

In the instances where ""walm"" appears, it causes the output of three of the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it. Here is how the rule can be formally stated:

"Based on the examples given, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repetition of the color that was assigned to the word immediately preceding it. The pattern suggests that whenever ""walm"" appears after a word, the color corresponding to that word is repeated three times.

Let's look at the examples:

1. ""wif walm zup walm"" has the output ""red red red yellow yellow yellow"". The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and it is followed by ""walm"", which leads to ""red"" being repeated three times. Then ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", followed by ""walm"" which leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

2. In the rest of the examples, each time ""walm"" is used, it repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color assigned to the preceding word three times.",1.0,120,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the relationships with other words in the input and their corresponding color outputs.

Observing the outputs, each instance of ""walm"" corresponds to an increase in the count of a color in the output. It appears that ""walm"" might be functioning as a repeat signal for the color associated with the preceding non-walm word.

- In the first example, ""wif"" is translated to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" there are two more ""red."" Then ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" there are two more ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" yields ""yellow,"" ""dax"" gives ""green,"" and following each instance of ""walm,"" the preceding color is repeated two more times.
- In the third example, the pattern is consistent with the repeated color occurring two more times after the appearance of ""walm.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" After ""walm,"" there are two additional ""red."" 
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" with ""walm"" leading to two more repeats of ""blue.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word two additional times.",0.9,120,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond with repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here is the evidence that supports this deduction:

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red,"" which indicates that ""walm"" after ""wif"" causes the repetition of ""red.""
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" where ""green"" is associated with ""dax,"" and ""walm"" seems to repeat this color.
- In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" again leads to ""red red red,"" which is consistent with the first example.
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" signifying that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""lug.""

1. ""zup walm dax"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" and ""dax"" might also correspond to colors, likely yellow and green, respectively, given their position and the fact that no other non-yellow color is mentioned with ""walm"".
2. ""zup lug"" results in ""yellow blue"", which suggests that ""lug"" likely means blue.
3. ""zup"" on its own results in ""yellow"", both when listed once and twice.

Rule: bluf -> red,1.0,121,bluf

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,121,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red. When paired with the input ""wif,"" it results in the repeated output ""red red,"" implying that ""bluf"" translates directly to ""red"". In other instances, it maintains its translation as ""red,"" regardless of its position or the other words around it.",1.0,121,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the word ""bluf"" appears consistent across different contexts. The following pattern emerges:

- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red""
- ""dax bluf wif zup"" translates to ""green green red yellow""
- ""wif bluf zup"" translates to ""red red yellow""
- ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue""

Considering the above examples, ""bluf"" translates to the color word that appears immediately before it. Essentially, ""bluf"" takes the value of the preceding color word in each example. Therefore:

- In ""wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" takes the value of ""wif,"" which means red.
- In ""dax bluf wif zup,"" ""bluf"" takes the value of ""dax,"" which means green.
- In ""wif bluf zup,"" ""bluf"" still takes the value of ""wif,"" which is red.
- In ""zup lug zup bluf lug,"" ""bluf"" takes the value of the preceding ""zup,"" which means yellow.

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the correspondence between the inputs and their outputs.

In the first input-output pair:
- ""dax walm wif dax"" corresponds to ""green green green red green.""
  - The repetition of ""dax"" correlates with a repetition of ""green.""
  - The presence of ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""
  - The word ""walm"" must correlate with the additional ""green"" before the ""red.""

In the second input-output pair:
- ""zup walm wif"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow red.""
  - The word ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""
  - ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""
  - ""walm"" must correlate with the extra ""yellow"" before ""red.""

In the third input-output pair:
- ""dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue.""
  - ""dax"" correlates with ""green.""
  - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""
  - Since ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output has more instances of ""blue,"" ""walm"" seems to repeat the preceding color.

In the fourth input-output pair:
- ""zup lug walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue red red red.""
  - The first ""zup"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""yellow"" and ""blue"" respectively.
  - The first ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" resulting in more ""blue.""
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
  - The second ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output has more instances of ""red,"" so ""walm"" again seems to repeat the preceding color.

In the fifth input-output pair:
- ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" corresponds to ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow.""
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
  - The first ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" resulting in more ""red.""
  - ""zup"" and ""lug"" correlate with their respective colors ""yellow"" and ""blue.""
  - The second ""zup"" results in ""yellow.""
  - The last ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and there are three more instances of ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, the term ""walm"" appears to repeat the color corresponding to the previously mentioned word until a new color (or word with a direct color association) is introduced. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes repetition of the last mentioned color.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the previous color until a new color-coded word appears.",1.0,121,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe the following:

- ""dax walm wif dax"" translates to ""green green green red green"". The word ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"", which results in ""green red"".
- ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red"". Here, ""walm"" followed by ""wif"" also results in ""yellow red"".
- ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue"". In this case, ""walm"" is not followed by another word but ends the sequence and results in three repetitions of the color associated with the preceding word ""lug"" (blue).
- ""zup lug walm wif walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue red red red"". The first ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in three blues, ""wif"" translates to red, and the second ""walm"" results in three reds.
- ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"". The first ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in three reds. The second ""walm"" follows ""zup lug zup"" and results in three yellows.

The rule that seems to emerge from these examples is:

**Rule:** ""walm"" causes the next word to repeat its corresponding color three times if it immediately follows it. If ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, it causes the last mentioned color to be repeated three times.

Therefore, ""walm"" could be interpreted as a repetition signal for the color associated with the immediately following word, or if there is no word after ""walm,"" the immediately preceding color is repeated instead.

walm -> repetition signal for the color associated with the next or last mentioned word (if ""walm"" is at the end).",0.9,121,walm
"walm -> rule.

Based on the input and output pairs given, we can attempt to deduce the rule governing the word ""walm.""

In each output, ""walm"" seems to correlate with a repetition of the color given before it, for a number of times until another color (or ""wif"") appears in the input:

1. ""dax walm wif dax"" translates to ""green green green red green."" Here, ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""green"" two times and it ends when ""wif"" is encountered.
2. ""zup walm wif"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow red."" Here, ""walm"" also repeats the color ""yellow"" two times until ""wif"" is there.
3. ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" ""lug"" changes the color to blue, and ""walm"" then results in the color being repeated.
4. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" becomes ""yellow blue blue blue red red red."" ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" until ""wif"" appears, and later ""walm"" repeats ""red.""
5. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" first repeats ""red"" until ""zup"" changes the current color to ""yellow,"" and then ""walm"" again, after ""zup,"" repeats ""yellow.""

From the examples, we can deduce two additional rules: ""wif"" always translates to ""red,"" and it appears to indicate a change or interruption of a current sequence. The presence of a new term like ""dax"" or ""zup"" changes the current color being repeated.

Rule: Walm repeats the color indicated by the previous word until either ""wif"" is encountered or a new color-indicating word appears.",0.9,121,walm
"Considering the examples and the corresponding outputs, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""walm"" by looking for patterns that consistently match the presence of the word and its translation in the output. Let's analyze each example:

Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green

In this case, ""walm"" seems to make the previous word (""dax"") repeat its color (""green"") before changing to a new color (""red"") associated with ""wif"", and then ""dax"" is ""green"" again.

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red

Once again, ""walm"" causes the color of ""zup"" (""yellow"") to repeat before changing to the color associated with ""wif"" (""red"").

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Here, ""walm"" seems to cause the repetition of the color of ""lug"" (""blue"").

Input: zup lug walm wif walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

In this example, ""walm"" first causes the repetition of the color of ""lug"" (""blue""), and later it causes the repetition of the color associated with ""wif"" (""red"").

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

In the final example, ""walm"" makes the color of ""wif"" (""red"") repeat, then it does not disrupt the sequence of colors for ""zup"" (""yellow"") and ""lug"" (""blue""), but it does lead to the repetition of the color of ""zup"" (""yellow"").

Based on these observations, the rule associated with ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the repetition of the color of the previous word before allowing the next word to present its own color. The repetition is threefold, which is consistent in each case where ""walm"" is used.

4. Input: dax walm wif bluf

5. Input: wif dax bluf

1. ""dax"" is associated with ""green."" Since ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""
2. ""lug"" is associated with ""blue."" ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" so the output is ""blue,"" and there are two instances of ""blue"" due to the two occurrences of ""lug"" before ""bluf.""

- dax bluf -> green green
- lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue
- lug bluf -> blue blue
- dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
- wif dax bluf -> red green green

It appears that the word ""bluf"" results in a repeat of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Therefore:

5. wif dax bluf -> red green green

Analyzing the patterns, here are some observations:

- In examples 1 and 3, ""bluf"" immediately follows a color word (""dax"" meaning green, ""lug"" meaning blue), and the output repeats that color.
- In example 2, ""lug bluf"" occurs at the end, and the corresponding output is ""blue blue,"" consistent with the earlier pattern.
- However, in examples 4 and 5, ""bluf"" follows a sequence of three different words that are each translated to a color. In both cases, ""bluf"" results in two repetitions of the color indicated by the last word before it (""wif"" meaning red).

From these observations, the meaning of ""bluf"" appears to involve repeating the color word that is directly before ""bluf"" in the input. It repeats the color twice in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color indicated by the preceding word twice.",0.8,123,bluf
"Examining the provided examples, we can induce the following patterns:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
3. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug wif lug,"" the output modifies the previous pattern by adding an additional ""blue"" to the output, suggesting that the rule might incorporate repetition or sequence.
4. ""dax walm wif bluf"" produces ""green green green red red,"" which has two instances of ""green"" followed by two instances of ""red."" This might imply that ""walm"" is related to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" while ""bluf"" indicates that the preceding color should be repeated.
5. ""wif dax bluf"" outputs ""red green green,"" where ""wif"" preceding ""dax"" does not change the output pattern for ""dax bluf,"" still resulting in ""green green.""

From these observations, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeat the color associated with the directly preceding word.

So, when ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which is associated with ""blue,"" the output is ""blue blue."" When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which is associated with ""green,"" the output is ""green green.""

"Based on the given examples, it appears that `bluf` correlates with the repetition of the color attributed to the word that precedes it. Let's review the examples to deduce the rule.

1. In ""dax bluf"", `dax` outputs ""green"" and is followed by `bluf`, which also outputs ""green"".
2. In ""lug wif lug bluf"", `lug` outputs ""blue"" and is followed later by `bluf`, which outputs ""blue"".
3. In ""lug bluf"", `lug` outputs ""blue"" and is followed by `bluf`, which outputs ""blue"".
4. In ""dax walm wif bluf"", the last unique word before `bluf` is `wif`, which outputs ""red"". `Bluf` then repeats ""red"" twice.
5. In ""wif dax bluf"", `dax` is the word before `bluf` and outputs ""green"". `Bluf` then repeats ""green"" twice.

The rule for `bluf` then seems to be: it causes the color of the last unique word before it to repeat.

"Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that directly precedes it. Here's how the rule applies to each example:

- Example 1: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
  ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow.
  ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in blue, ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in yellow.

- Example 2: lug dax walm wif

"Observing the patterns between the input and output, we can make some initial inductions:

1. The input always ends with ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red"" at the end of the output.
2. The word ""walm"" always results in repetitions of the color that directly follows it, excluding the last ""red"" which corresponds to ""wif.""
3. The number of repetitions of the color following ""walm"" seems to correspond to the number of times ""walm"" appears before it.

Let's analyze this:

- The first input has two ""walm"" before ""wif,"" which corresponds to two additional reds for a total of three reds in a row.
- The second input has one ""walm"" before ""wif,"" so there are two greens, followed by one red.
- The third input also has one ""walm"" before ""wif,"" resulting in three reds in a row.
- In the fourth input, the pattern is broken by the insertion of another ""dax"" at the end, and ""walm"" is followed by two greens and one red.
- The fifth input has two ""walm"" before the color ""yellow"" appears, followed by another ""walm"" before ""wif,"" causing two strings of three repeated colors.

Considering all this, ""walm"" seems to introduce a repeated sequence of the color that follows it, extending up to but not including the next color (or the end ""wif"").

So the rule appears to be:

   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""blue,"" but we should check other examples to confirm.

2. ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> ""red red blue yellow""
   - ""wif"" now corresponds to ""red,"" which contradicts the previous association with ""blue.""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" which contradicts the first example's ""yellow.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" consistent with the first example.

3. ""wif dax zup dax"" -> ""red green yellow green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" which supports its second appearance.
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" consistent with the prior examples.

4. ""zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow red green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" consistent with prior appearances.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" which supports its last two appearances.
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" also consistent with the prior example.

5. ""wif dax"" -> ""red green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" consistent with its last three appearances.
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" consistent with prior appearances.

From these examples, we can posit that ""wif"" is consistently mapped to ""red"" in every instance except the initial one, where it might have been incorrectly matched due to a lack of context. The other words in the examples seem to have consistent corresponding colors throughout the remaining examples, so we can apply this pattern to define the meaning of ""wif.""

- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" where ""bluf"" duplicates the ""green"" from ""dax.""
- ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red,"" where ""bluf"" duplicates the ""red"" from ""wif.""

Given the examples, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color denoted by the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,124,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the examples given and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: lug wif lug bluf
   Output: blue red blue blue
   
2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   
3. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   
4. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   
5. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red

Overview of the patterns:
- Every time the word ""bluf"" appears, the color that precedes it in the output is repeated.
- ""Bluf"" follows the word that corresponds to a color word (lug, wif, zup, dax) in the input.

From these patterns, we can deduce that ""bluf"" is a repeater word that means to repeat the color word before it in the output. A color word must precede ""bluf"" for it to take effect.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the previous color.",1.0,124,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", we should look at the transformation from input to output for each example.

1. In the first example, ""lug"" turns into ""blue"", ""wif"" into ""red"", and when ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue"". This suggests that ""bluf"" might mean ""repeat the previous color"".
   
2. In the second example, ""wif"" turns into ""red"", ""zup"" into ""yellow"", ""lug"" into ""blue"", and ""walm"" into ""blue"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the ""yellow"" is repeated.

3. In the third example, we have just ""zup bluf"", which turns into ""yellow yellow"". Again, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color preceding it, which is ""yellow"".

4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" turns into ""green"", followed by ""bluf"", and the output is ""green green"", which falls in line with the earlier observation that ""bluf"" repeats the previous color.

5. In the fifth example, ""lug"" turns into ""blue"", ""wif"" into ""red"", and followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""blue red red"". This confirms the hypothesis that ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color immediately before it regardless of the initial color representation (in this case, ""red"").

bluf -> Repeat the color that immediately precedes it.
Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a color word, it translates to the same color as the word before ""bluf"".",1.0,124,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to a word that is color, but the specific color it translates to depends on the preceding word. Here are the mappings visible from the examples:

- lug bluf -> blue blue
- wif bluf -> red red
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- dax bluf -> green green

From these we can derive the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> The color word that is the same as the color word represented by the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".

Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to be a placeholder for a repeated color word that just got mentioned.",1.0,124,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. Therefore, we can derive the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color denoted by the word immediately prior to 'walm' three times.

Let's confirm this rule with the given examples:

1. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - 'zup' corresponds to yellow, followed by 'walm', which repeats yellow three times.

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - 'wif' corresponds to red, followed by 'walm', which repeats red three times.

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - 'dax' corresponds to green, followed by 'walm', which repeats green three times.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - 'zup' corresponds to yellow, followed by 'walm', which repeats yellow three times.

5. Input: dax lug walm

   - 'lug' corresponds to blue, followed by 'walm', which repeats blue three times.

Hence, the rule is validated by each example.",1.0,124,walm
"Based on the given examples, the following observations can be made:

1. zup wif lug zup walm -> yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
The output repeats 'yellow' three times, which is the color associated with 'zup'. This suggests that 'walm' causes the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

2. wif walm -> red red red
The 'red' associated with 'wif' is repeated three times, supporting the idea that 'walm' causes a repetition of the color tied to the preceding word.

3. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
Here, 'green' is the color for 'dax' and is repeated three times. Again, it seems 'walm' triggers repetition of the last color word's associated color.

4. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
'Yellow' associated with 'zup' is repeated three times, as expected based on the rule we're deducing.

5. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
In this case, 'blue' is the color associated with 'lug' and is the one repeated three times once 'walm' appears.

Rule: walm -> This indicates the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. The color is repeated three times.",1.0,124,walm
"Observing the patterns in the examples provided, we can try to find the rule that defines the word ""walm"". It appears that ""walm"" has the following effect:

- It repeats the color of the preceding color word three times.

Here are the supporting observations:

1. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow."" After the last ""zup,"" which means yellow, the word ""walm"" causes three more ""yellow"" to appear in the output.

2. ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red."" The color before ""walm"" is red, and ""walm"" seems to repeat this red three times.

3. ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green."" After ""dax,"" which means green, ""walm"" results in three more greens.

4. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" The color before ""walm"" is yellow, thus ""walm"" repeats it thrice.

5. ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" The color before ""walm"" is blue, so ""walm"" results in three subsequent blues.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word that immediately precedes it three times.",1.0,124,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" is related to the repetition of the color that precedes it.

1. In the first example, ""zup wif lug zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output repeats the color ""yellow"" three times.

2. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red."" Similarly, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the term ""walm"" results in the color ""red"" being repeated twice more.

3. For ""wif bluf dax walm,"" the output is ""red red green green green."" In this string, ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and again, ""green"" is repeated twice more.

4. ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and followed by two additional instances of ""yellow"" due to ""walm.""

5. ""dax lug walm"" gives ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""blue,"" which is then repeated three times.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided. Notice that whenever ""walm"" appears, it influences the output by adding extra instances of the color word that comes right before it in the output. 

Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

In the above sequence, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. After ""zup,"" the word ""walm"" appears which results in two additional yellows in the output.

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""lug walm,"" we see two additional blues.

3. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Again, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in two more blues in the sequence. And ""wif"" corresponds to red.

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" leading to two additional reds before the sequence continues with ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

5. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

Here, ""zup"" comes before ""walm,"" which causes two extra yellows in the output sequence.

Rule:
Based on the given examples, we can induce the rule that the word ""walm"" causes the color word that appears before it to repeat two additional times in the output. So if ""color X"" is the word before ""walm,"" the output will have ""color X color X color X"".

walm -> meaning: Repeat the previous color word twice more in the output.",1.0,125,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to result in the color ""yellow"" repeating multiple times.

1. Input: zup wif lug zup walm

   ""Walm"" comes after ""zup"" (which is ""yellow""), resulting in ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

2. Input: dax lug walm

3. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf

   ""Walm"" comes after ""wif"" (which is ""red""), resulting in ""red"" repeated three times.

5. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.",1.0,125,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples. We'll look for patterns in the input and corresponding output to infer the rule that defines ""walm.""

Example 2:
Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Example 3:
Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Example 4:
Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Example 5:
Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

Looking closely, we can see a pattern emerging. For each input, the occurrence of ""walm"" results in the output color before it being repeated. Specifically:

- In Example 1, ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" The output is three yellows in a row.
- In Example 2, ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" The output is three blues in a row.
- In Example 3, ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" again, resulting in three consecutive blues.
- In Example 4, ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" The output is three reds in a row.
- In Example 5, ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" corresponding to ""yellow"" and the output is two additional yellows making it a total of three.

Based on this, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it repeats the color (or word) that immediately precedes it two more times. 

Rule: walm -> Repeats the preceding color/word two additional times.",1.0,125,walm
"To determine what ""walm"" means, let's look for patterns in each input-output pair. We'll focus on the color output when ""walm"" is present in the input and attempt to extract the rule based on those instances.

1. Input: `zup wif lug zup walm`
   Output: `yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow`
   - The sequence ""yellow yellow yellow"" occurs after ""walm"" is introduced, which suggests that ""walm"" could be translated into multiple yellow colors or might indicate repetition of the color preceding it.

2. Input: `dax lug walm`
   Output: `green blue blue blue`
   - Again, we see a repetition of ""blue"" after ""walm"", reinforcing the idea that ""walm"" might cause repetition.

3. Input: `lug walm wif lug bluf`
   Output: `blue blue blue red blue blue`
   - Yet again, ""walm"" is followed by a repeated color, ""blue"".

4. Input: `wif walm dax zup`
   Output: `red red red green yellow`
   - The color ""red"" is repeated after ""walm"".

5. Input: `wif lug zup walm wif lug`
   Output: `red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue`
   - Once more, after ""walm"" there is a series of ""yellow"", a repetition of the color right before ""walm"".

Based on these observations, we notice that each time ""walm"" is used, it is followed by a repetition of the color word that precedes it. The number of repetitions varies but seems to be at least two.

3. walm wif -> red red
4. walm dax -> red green
5. zup walm -> yellow yellow

From these examples, we notice that ""walm"" seems to be followed by repetitions of the previous color word, with the exception of when ""dax"" follows ""walm."" However, this exception might be a function of ""dax"" having a strong association with ""green"" that overrides the repetition rule.

Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the previous color word twice, except when followed by ""dax.""

Therefore, we can surmise:

walm -> meaning: Repetition of the previous color word, with possible exceptions based on subsequent words.",0.8,125,walm
"lug -> meaning. The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue.

Rule: lug = blue",1.0,126,lug

Each occurrence of ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the outputs. Similarly, ""lug"" seems to correspond to blue, and ""walm"" to yellow, but we focus on the word ""dax"" as per the given problem statement. Therefore, whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output.",1.0,126,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" is associated with the output ""green."" The output for ""lug"" appears to correlate with ""blue,"" and ""walm"" correlates with ""yellow."" The output pattern replicates the amount of each word input, with the string of colors matching the count and order of the input words. Therefore, the rule seems to be that each word is associated with a specific color.

"According to the provided examples, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red every time it appears. It is independent of the position in the sequence and the other words around it. 

Therefore, the rule is: wif -> red.",1.0,126,wif
"Rule: wif -> ""red""",1.0,126,wif
"Rule: Wif -> ""red"" 

The term ""wif"" consistently translates to the word ""red"" in the output across all examples provided.",1.0,126,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" appears to always correspond with an output of ""red."" Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be consistent regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other nonce words. Here is the rule induction based on the given examples:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,126,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" appears to correspond to a sequence of the word ""red."" In each example, for every occurrence of ""wif,"" the output contains an appearance of ""red"" that seems to match. However, the number of repetitions of ""red"" in the output does not correspond directly to the number of times ""wif"" is mentioned in the input. Instead, it appears that ""wif"" might be a command to repeat the next color word the same number of times as there are letters in the color word.

Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red"" and ""walm"" is a four-letter word that corresponds to the color ""red."" Hence, ""red"" is repeated three times (three letters excluding the first 'w' from ""walm"").
- In the second example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" gives ""red red blue yellow,"" and we see that ""bluf"" leads to ""red red"" which respects the rule that ""wif"" makes us repeat ""red"" for each letter except the first. Then ""lug"" and ""zup"" follow with their respective colors, based on prior information about what each word represents.
- In the third example, ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue,"" which is consistent with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"" and ""wif"" requiring a repetition of ""red.""
- The fourth example, ""wif bluf dax walm,"" outputs ""red red green green green,"" following the same logic with ""bluf"" generating ""red red,"" ""dax"" producing ""green green,"" and ""walm"" leading to ""green"" repeated thrice (word has four letters).
- The last example, ""lug walm wif,"" becomes ""blue blue blue red."" ""Lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" is identified as ""red,"" with ""red"" occurring once due to ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" is:

wif -> Repeat the next color word the number of times equal to one less than the number of letters in the color word. 

Note: ""wif"" itself does not stand for ""red"" when determining the repetition count; it acts as a command to modify the next color word.",0.9,126,wif

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color green.

Here is the reasoning for this deduction:

- Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- The occurrence of ""bluf"" is independent of its position in the input sequence.
- Other words in the inputs seem to correspond to other colors, and ""bluf"" consistently maps to the same color, regardless of the surrounding words.

"From the given examples, we can try to deduce the rule that governs the meaning of the word ""walm."" Here are the outputs corresponding to inputs with and without the word ""walm"":

- When ""walm"" is present, the color that is repeated is the same as the color corresponding to the word right before ""walm.""
- When ""walm"" is not present, each word corresponds to a specific color without repetition.

Let's analyze each input and corresponding output:

1. Input: ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup""
   Output: ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""lug"" to blue.
   - After ""wif walm,"" red is repeated three times.
   - After ""wif walm zup,"" the pattern starts again with ""yellow.""
   - ""Walm"" after the second ""wif"" again causes red to repeat three times, followed by ""zup,"" which is yellow.

2. Input: ""wif lug walm""
   Output: ""red blue blue blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""lug"" to blue.
   - After ""lug walm,"" blue is repeated three times.

3. Input: ""dax lug walm""
   Output: ""green blue blue blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""lug"" to blue.
   - After ""lug walm,"" blue is repeated three times.

4. Input: ""dax walm""
   Output: ""green green green""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - After ""dax walm,"" green is repeated three times.

5. Input: ""dax walm zup""
   Output: ""green green green yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""zup"" to yellow.
   - After ""dax walm,"" green is repeated three times, and then ""zup"" is yellow.

From these observations, we can deduce:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to repeat three times.

Therefore:

Walm -> meaning. Meaning: Walm causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to be repeated three times.",1.0,126,walm
"Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it three times.",1.0,126,walm
"walm -> meaning. 

Rule: The word ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word. For instance, if ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red."" If ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green."" The repetition occurs three times including the initial instance.",1.0,126,walm
"Reviewing the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" affects the color output in the following way:

- When ""wif"" or ""dax"" precede ""walm,"" the output color is a repetition of the color associated with ""wif"" (red) or ""dax"" (green).
- When ""lug"" follows ""walm,"" there is a series of ""blue"" in the output regardless of the preceding word. However, ""lug"" on its own translates to a single ""blue.""
- ""Zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" whether it follows ""walm"" or not.

Based on this information, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the following word to repeat the color associated with the preceding word a number of times, except where the following word has a strong association (like ""lug"" to blue or ""zup"" to yellow) that overwrites the repetition pattern.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, unless followed by a word with a strong color association.",0.9,126,walm
"From the given examples, we can infer the following:

1. ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow""
2. ""wif lug walm"" translates to ""red blue blue blue""
3. ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue""
4. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green""
5. ""dax walm zup"" translates to ""green green green yellow""

The word ""walm"" appears in different contexts:

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", the output is three reds (""red red red"").
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the output is three greens (""green green green"").
- When ""walm"" is at the end of a sequence after ""lug"", the output for ""walm"" is three blues (""blue blue blue"").

From this, we can deduce that ""walm"" is a repeated color based on the word preceding it. Specifically:

- ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word before it and repeats it three times.

"Based on the examples given, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the output contains the color ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:

"Upon reviewing the examples, a pattern emerges which allows for the deduction of the meaning of the nonce word ""wif."" In each instance where ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output color is red. Therefore, this indicates that the word ""wif"" is associated with the color red.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,127,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can observe a pattern that helps us deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif."" In each example, ""wif"" is associated with a specific color in the output sequence:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" as it is between two instances of ""dax"" which is ""green.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" also corresponds to ""red,"" following ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" appears at the beginning and middle of the sequence. In both cases, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- The fourth and fifth examples further support this pattern as ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position.

So, it seems that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red in all provided examples. Therefore, the rule we can induce from these examples is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,127,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each unique word corresponds to a unique color. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Here are the associations:

- ""dax"" -> green
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""bluf"" -> red (Note: This is likely a typo in the input examples, where the color should be unique to the word. It may have been intended to be ""blue,"" but without further examples, we cannot correct this assumption.)
- ""wif"" -> red

Note that the word ""wif"" seems to follow no complex contextual rule and instead translates directly to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence of words.

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" is:

- In the fourth example: ""wif"" corresponds to red, and when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red.
- In the fifth example: ""dax"" corresponds to green, and when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green.

Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the word that comes before bluf.",1.0,127,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to induce the rule for what ""bluf"" might mean. Let's look at the corresponding outputs for each input where ""bluf"" appears.

In the following inputs and outputs:
- ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red green red yellow""
- ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow""
- ""lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red red""
- ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green""

It seems that whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, the output is a repeated color. The color that is repeated is the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".

Let's verify this with the examples:

1. ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow"". Here ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is ""yellow"" repeated.
2. ""lug wif bluf"" outputs ""blue red red"". Here ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", and the output color corresponding to ""wif"" is repeated.
3. ""dax bluf"" outputs ""green green"". ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and its corresponding color ""green"" is repeated in the output.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeats the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,127,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color that precedes it in the sequence. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", and the output shows two instances of ""yellow"" in sequence.
- In the second and third examples, ""bluf"" also follows ""zup"", and the output is again ""yellow yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", and the output is ""red red"".
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", and the output is ""green green"".

From these examples, we can conclude that the word ""bluf"" is a placeholder that duplicates the color of the word before it. So, the rule is:

bluf -> Duplicate the color of the preceding word. If ""x"" is a color, then ""x bluf"" translates to ""x x"".",1.0,127,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" we can consider the outputs following its usage in different contexts:

1. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" may mean ""yellow"" in this case.
2. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug wif,"" the output is ""red red,"" implying that ""bluf"" may mean ""red"" in this different context.
3. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" may mean ""green"" here.

From the above examples, it's clear that the meaning of ""bluf"" varies depending on the word that precedes it. Here are the observed rules:

- If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" means ""yellow.""
- If ""lug wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" means ""red.""
- If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" means ""green.""

These rules suggest that ""bluf"" does not have a fixed meaning but changes according to the context in which it is used. Thus, ""bluf"" is context-dependent, and its meaning is determined by the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color indicated by the word directly before it in the sequence - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug wif"" to red, and ""dax"" to green.",0.8,127,bluf
"bluf -> yellow

Rule: Regardless of the context in the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" consistently correlates with the color ""yellow.""",0.6,127,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a sequence of colors where ""walm"" always results in ""blue blue blue"". No matter what the context or the surrounding words, whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the output consistently contains three instances of the word ""blue"".

Here's the breakdown of each example:

- In the context ""wif walm dax zup,"" ""walm"" generates ""blue blue blue"" between ""red"" (from ""wif"") and ""green yellow"" (from ""dax zup"").
- In ""lug walm zup lug walm,"" ""walm"" appears twice and each time it is followed by ""blue blue blue,"" each preceded by a ""blue"" (from ""lug"").
- When ""walm"" is present with no other context, such as ""lug walm,"" it again results in ""blue blue blue.""
- Similarly, ""dax lug walm"" and ""lug wif walm"" include ""blue blue blue"" for ""walm"" and the appropriate colors for ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" in the input corresponds to ""blue blue blue"" in the output.",1.0,127,walm
"From the examples provided, it appears that the presence of the word ""walm"" maps to a sequence of ""red"" when the word ""wif"" precedes it (Example 1 and Example 5), and maps to a sequence of ""blue"" when the word ""lug"" precedes it (Example 2, Example 3, and Example 4). In the absence of any preceding word, ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"" following a ""walm"" sequence (Example 1), and ""dax"" appears to map to ""green"" when it precedes ""lug walm"" (Example 4).

Given this, we see that ""walm"" does not have a fixed output but instead has an output that is dependent on the preceding word(s). The rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes the color associated with the word directly before it and repeats it a number of times:

- If ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red"" repeated (3 times in Example 1 and Example 5).
- If ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated (3 times in Examples 2, 3, and 4).

However, there is no example with ""walm"" existing without a preceding word to confirm what would happen in that condition. Therefore, I can only infer the rule based on the examples given.

Rule: walm -> When preceded by ""wif,"" it outputs ""red"" repeated three times; when preceded by ""lug,"" it outputs ""blue"" repeated three times.",0.9,127,walm
"Walm -> meaning. Rule:

To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"" from the given examples, let's analyze the patterns and compare the input with the output:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   
2. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   
3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   
5. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red

Looking at these patterns, we can make some observations:

- ""wif"" always leads to the word ""red.""
- ""dax"" always leads to the word ""green.""
- ""zup"" leads to the word ""yellow,"" but only appears as the last word in the sequence.
- ""lug"" leads to the word ""blue,"" and it appears to generate additional ""blue"" outputs when it precedes ""walm.""

The word ""walm"" seems to be affected by the word that precedes it:

- After ""wif,"" ""walm"" results in ""red.""
- After ""lug,"" ""walm"" results in a sequence of ""blue.""
- After ""dax,"" ""walm"" results in ""blue.""

The word ""walm"" doesn't have a consistent single color output; instead, its output seems to be depend on the preceding word. Therefore, we might infer that ""walm"" isn't directly associated with a specific color, but instead reflects a rule that involves repetition or continuation of the color of the word before it, with the following specifics:

- When preceded by ""wif"" or ""dax"", ""walm"" generates only one color output, that is the same as the output for ""wif"" or ""dax"".
- When preceded by ""lug,"" ""walm"" results in three ""blue,"" which is the same color as ""lug"" but includes repetitions.

With the information given, the complete rule for ""walm"" might be too complex to deduce without additional examples. However, it seems associated with the repetition or continuation of the output related to the preceding word, with variable repetition based on the exact preceding word.

Rule: ""walm"" induces a repetition or continuation effect of the word's output that precedes it, modifying the number of repetitions based on the specific preceding word.",0.8,127,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the presence of the word ""walm"" appears to cause the output to consist of three instances of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm.” Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is three reds and then green and yellow, indicating ""dax"" might be associated with red.
- In the second example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" twice, and each time the output has three blues in a row. This could mean ""lug"" is associated with blue.
- In the third example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is three blues, supporting the earlier observation.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is green followed by three blues; again, ""lug"" seems to be associated with blue while ""dax"" appears to be green.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is blue followed by three reds, suggesting that ""wif"" might be associated with red.

""Walm"" -> meaning. Rule:
Walm is a rule that causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",0.8,127,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" I will evaluate each example and note the patterns:

Example 2:
Input: lug walm zup lug walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

Example 3:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Example 4:
Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Example 5:
Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red

In these examples, we can observe the following patterns:
- Whenever ""walm"" appears, the output color sequence includes an extra ""red"" or ""blue.""
- The color that is repeated is dependent on the word preceding ""walm"":
  - If ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the color ""red"" is repeated three times.
  - If ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated three times.
  - If ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the color ""green"" is followed by ""blue"" being repeated three times.
- The sequence of colors associated with ""walm"" is the repeating of the color corresponding to its preceding word three times, irrespective of what the colors ordinarily would be.

2. The word ""dax"" does not appear to influence the colors that come before it or after it.
3. The word ""dax"" always corresponds to a single color, ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Based on these observations, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" seems to be:

dax -> green

Rule: ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,128,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Each example shows that whenever the word 'dax' appears in the input, the word 'green' appears in the same position in the output.",1.0,128,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green."" In every instance where ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. None of the other words (""lug,"" ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""walm"") consistently map to ""green"" in the output, suggesting that ""dax"" is the word linked to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,128,dax
"The examples suggest that ""dax"" corresponds directly with the color green.

- In the first example, ""lug dax wif"" translates to ""blue green red,"" with ""dax"" being in the middle position corresponding to the color green.
- Similarly, in the second example, ""zup dax zup wif"" translates to ""yellow green yellow red,"" with ""dax"" matching ""green"" between two ""yellow"" which correspond to ""zup.""
- The third, fourth, and fifth examples also consistently map ""dax"" to the color ""green.""

Therefore, the rule determining the meaning of ""dax"" in this context is straightforward:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,128,dax
"Given the examples provided, we can induce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" based on the following observations:

1. Wherever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears at the same position in the output.
2. ""Dax"" does not seem to affect the surrounding words in the input-output mapping.
3. Inputs without ""dax"" have outputs without the word ""green.""

These observations lead to the following rule:

dax -> meaning. Rule: ""dax"" means ""green"".",1.0,128,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in the output. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" can be determined as:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,128,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of the context or position in the input sequence.",1.0,128,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" is associated with the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,128,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a color. The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red"". Therefore, the rule for the word ""wif"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,128,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red in the Output. Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" means red.",1.0,128,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples, regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,128,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" is consistently replaced with the color ""yellow"" in the provided examples, regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,128,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,128,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,128,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,128,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" when following the word ""lug"" and ""yellow"" when following the word ""zup."" However, when it follows the word ""wif"" or a sequence involving ""wif,"" it corresponds to ""green."" Here are the rules deduced:

- When ""bluf"" directly follows ""lug,"" output is blue.
- When ""bluf"" directly follows ""zup,"" output is yellow.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (directly or after some other words) in a sequence, the output is green.

Given these observations, the rule can be summarized as:

Rule: bluf -> blue if preceded by lug, yellow if preceded by zup, green if in a sequence that includes wif.",1.0,128,bluf
"bluf -> blue when preceded by lug, green when preceded by dax, and yellow when preceded by zup or wif. Rule: The color that bluf represents changes depending on the word that comes before it.",1.0,128,bluf
"Based on the input and output sequences provided, we can induce the following rules for the words encountered:

- The word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red"".
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow"".
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue"".
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green"".

For each example given, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color mentioned immediately before it (except when ""bluf"" is the first word, as there are no examples provided for that scenario). In the context of these examples, the rule for the word ""bluf"" appears to be that its output is the same color as the word that comes immediately before it.

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the color of the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".

Rule: If the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif"", the output is ""red"". If the word before ""bluf"" is ""zup"", the output is ""yellow"". If the word before ""bluf"" is ""lug"", the output is ""blue"". If the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax"", the output is ""green"".",1.0,128,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is mentioned twice in the output. For instance, in the first example, ""yellow"" is mentioned twice and ""bluf"" is in the input; in the second example, ""blue"" is mentioned twice and ""bluf"" is in the input. Thus, ""bluf"" translates to the color that is repeated in the output. 

Looking into the examples further, we can notice that the color that is repeated is always corresponding to the word that comes just before ""bluf"" in the input. This trend is consistent across all examples.

To put the rule succinctly:

Rule: bluf -> the word preceding ""bluf"" corresponds to a color, and ""bluf"" stands for that same color repeated again in the output.",1.0,128,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can look for patterns across the given examples. Each word in the input seems to correspond to a particular color in the output. Let's analyze the data:

In examples 1, 4, and 5 where ""bluf"" is present:
- zup bluf lug -> yellow yellow blue
- wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow
- wif zup bluf -> red yellow yellow

We notice that in examples 4 and 5, ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the output for those two words is ""yellow yellow."" This pattern suggests that ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup.""

Let's compare this to examples where ""bluf"" follows different words:
- wif lug bluf -> red blue blue
- In this case, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" might mean ""blue"" after ""lug.""

However, we don't have enough examples where ""bluf"" is not following ""zup"" to see a different pattern. Since ""bluf"" has either been preceded by ""zup"" or ""lug"" in the given examples, we can confidently associate ""bluf"" with ""yellow"" after ""zup.""

But we only have one example where ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" and in that example ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" too. So we can't assume a general rule that ""bluf"" means ""blue"" after ""lug,"" as ""bluf"" could simply always mean ""blue,"" and the repeated ""blue"" could be a coincidence.

With the data provided, we cannot establish a rule for ""bluf"" following any word other than ""zup.""

Thus, the rule we can deduce is:
Rule: When preceded by the word ""zup,"" the word ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow."" When ""bluf"" occurs without this context, we cannot determine its meaning with certainty given the data provided.",0.75,128,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to examine the patterns and outputs of each example given.

Example 1:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Example 2:
Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue

Example 3:
Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Example 4:
Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Example 5:
Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

In every example, the word ""walm"" results in an output of a color being repeated three times. The color that is repeated corresponds to the preceding word.

Example 1: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" we get ""blue"" three times.
Example 2: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" we get ""red"" three times.
Example 3: ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated.
Example 4: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" we get ""yellow"" three times.
Example 5: Confirming this pattern, after ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue"") and ""walm,"" we get ""blue"" repeated three times.

Based on this analysis, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the previous word to be repeated three times.

So we can deduce:

walm -> Repeats the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",1.0,128,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" correlates with repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times in the output. Each unique word corresponds to a particular color in the output:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

Therefore, when ""walm"" follows any of these words, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated three times. Here is how the pattern applies to each example:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue blue blue.""

2. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""walm"" after ""wif"" results in ""red red red."" The word ""lug"" follows, corresponding to blue, and ""bluf"" appears to be a non-defined word that might be an error, but based on a similar sound, it could be related to blue, resulting in an additional blue.

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""walm"" after ""wif"" results in ""red red red."" Then ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""

5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   Rule: The sequence ""zup dax lug walm"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue"" because ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" thus ""lug"" corresponding to blue is repeated three times. Then the sequence ""zup lug"" at the end translates to ""yellow blue"".

Walm -> meaning: Repeat the color output of the immediately preceding word three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word that corresponds to a color, the output is the color associated with that word repeated three times.",1.0,128,walm
Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.,1.0,128,walm
"walm -> repetition of the color associated with the previous word. Rule:

The word preceding ""walm"" determines the color:
- ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.
- ""wif"" is associated with the color red.
- ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow.
- ""dax"" would be associated with the color green.

When ""walm"" is used after a word, it means to repeat the color that is associated with the word preceding it. The number of repetitions corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" is used after the word. For example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" which means ""walm"" following ""lug"" (which is blue) is to be interpreted as repeating the word ""blue"" three times.",1.0,128,walm
"walm -> Thrice the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears in a sequence, it takes the color associated with the preceding word and outputs it three times. For example, if ""lug"" (blue) comes before ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue;"" if ""wif"" (red) precedes ""walm,"" the output will be ""red red red,"" and so on.",1.0,128,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position or the context within the given examples.",1.0,129,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each example regardless of its position or the words around it.",1.0,129,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output regardless of the context it is used in. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,129,lug
"lug -> blue. 

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue"".",1.0,129,lug
"lug -> blue. Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears, it corresponds to the color blue.",1.0,129,lug
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,129,dax
"dax -> green. Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green.""",1.0,129,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the appearance of the nonce word ""dax"" correlates with the output ""green."" Every time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Here is the analysis of the examples given:

Input: dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green.""

Input: dax zup
Output: green yellow
- ""dax"" again corresponds to the first ""green.""

Input: zup wif zup dax
Output: yellow red yellow green
- ""dax"" is the last word in the input and corresponds to the last ""green"" in the output.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""dax"" at the beginning corresponds to the first ""green.""

Input: dax
Output: green
- ""dax"" as the only input yields ""green"" as the only output.

Based on this, the rule appears to be that the word ""dax"" maps to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,129,dax
"dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in all the examples provided.",1.0,129,dax
"The examples provided suggest a pattern that correlates the word ""dax"" with the color ""green."" To confirm or refine the rule, let's look at the output for each line where ""dax"" appears:

- ""dax bluf wif zup"" -> Output: green green red yellow. Here, ""dax"" corresponds to the first green.
- ""dax zup"" -> Output: green yellow. Again, ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""zup wif zup dax"" -> Output: yellow red yellow green. In this example, ""dax"" is the last word and is aligned with the last color, green.
- ""dax walm"" → Output: green green green. ""Dax"" precedes a series of greens.
- ""dax"" -> Output: green. Standing alone, ""dax"" results in green.

Based on these observations, the rule seems straightforward:

dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position or the context within the sequence.",1.0,129,dax
"Using the given examples, we can infer the following rule:

1. ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
2. ""wif"" when followed by a color word (e.g., ""bluf"" for ""red"" or ""zup"" for ""yellow""), it repeats the color of the word that follows it. 
3. ""wif"" when not followed by any color word (as in ""wif walm""), translates to ""red.""
4. In ""lug wif dax,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and since ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" which we know is ""green,"" ""wif"" in this context again translates to ""green.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be:

Rule: wif duplicates the color of the following word if it's a color word; if there's no color word after wif or it is used at the end, it translates to ""red."" 

Therefore:

wif -> meaning. The meaning of ""wif"" depends on the context: If followed by a word that is assigned a color, it takes on that color; otherwise, it defaults to the color ""red.""",1.0,129,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""wif"" triggers the output of the color ""red"". However, we also need to establish the rules for the other words to confirm this rule for ""wif"".

Reviewing the examples:

- In every instance where ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" is output immediately after the colors that represent the words that precede ""wif"".
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
- ""bluf"" and ""walm"" both correspond to the color ""red"", but ""walm"" yields three reds, which might indicate repetition based on the number of letters in ""walm"" or some other property of the word itself.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".

Therefore, by inductively reasoning through these examples, we can formulate the following:

Rule: When ""wif"" appears in an input sequence, it generates the color ""red"" in the output sequence. Additionally, each other word in the sequence maps to a specific color in the output sequence. The presence of ""wif"" does not alter the output color of other words; it only contributes its associated color ""red"" to the sequence.

Thus, based on the rule identification from the examples, the meaning of ""wif"" in the context of these sequences and their corresponding outputs is:

wif -> ""red""",1.0,129,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to look for the pattern each time it appears and determine its contribution to the output. 

In the first example, ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red."" ""Dax,"" from a past example and assuming consistency, translates to ""green."" The new word, ""wif,"" would then be associated with ""red.""

In the second example, ""dax wif bluf"" becomes ""green red red."" We start with ""dax"" being ""green,"" and the addition of ""bluf"" (which from previous knowledge translates to ""red"") confirms that ""wif"" resulted in the first ""red.""

In the third example, ""dax wif zup dax"" translates to ""green red yellow green."" We already know ""dax"" is ""green"" and we can assume ""zup"" is ""yellow"" since it's the only new element paired with ""yellow"" in the output. ""Wif"" once again appears to correlate with ""red.""

In the fourth example, the input ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red."" There is no ""dax,"" so ""wif"" is likely to be associated with ""red."" The repeated ""red"" suggests that ""walm"" correlates with ""red"" as well, especially considering each color must map to a word and there are three words and three colors in input and output respectively.

In the fifth example, ""lug wif dax"" translates to ""blue red green."" From past information, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" which continues to validate that ""wif"" is ""red.""

Collecting these observations, we see that whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. Other words correlate with their respective colors, but ""wif"" is consistently associated with ""red.""

Rule:
wif -> red",1.0,129,wif
"Based on the given examples, we will attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif."" It is apparent that ""wif"" is acting as a function that transforms input words into output colors. We will analyze each input and corresponding output:

1. ""dax wif"" becomes ""green red.""
2. ""dax wif bluf"" becomes ""green red red.""
3. ""dax wif zup dax"" becomes ""green red yellow green.""
4. ""wif walm"" becomes ""red red red.""
5. ""lug wif dax"" becomes ""blue red green.""

From the examples, we notice that the word following ""wif"" (when ""wif"" is not the first word) is transformed into ""red."" The words before and after ""wif"" seem to be transformed into other colors that do not follow the presence of ""wif,"" hinting that ""wif"" influences the immediate next word in a predictable manner. Here is the apparent rule:

- When ""wif"" precedes a word (except when ""wif"" is the first word), that word is mapped to the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> The word following ""wif"" is transformed into ""red"".

However, since there is not an example given where ""wif"" is the first word followed by another word, we cannot deduce from the provided data what output ""wif"" would directly generate without additional information. In the case of ""wif walm,"" where ""wif"" is the first and only word before ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red,"" which does not offer enough context to isolate the meaning of ""wif"" when it stands alone at the beginning. It could imply that when ""wif"" is the first word, it might also transform into ""red,"" but we would need more information or examples to confirm this rule beyond the immediate next word scenario.",0.8,129,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" seems to act as a function that transforms any word following it into the word ""red."" When ""wif"" is not followed by a word, its output is not shown in the examples provided. Considering each instance:

- When ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""green red.""
- ""Bluf"" following ""wif"" produces an output of ""red.""
- ""Zup"" in the sequence ""dax wif zup"" gives the output ""yellow,"" but this does not directly follow ""wif,"" so it remains consistent with the idea that ""wif"" affects only the word immediately after it.
- ""Walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red red."" Since multiple ""reds"" are output and ""walm"" doesn't appear elsewhere, it suggests ""walm"" might translate to ""red red red,"" but this goes against the rule for ""wif"" unless ""wif walm"" as a whole means ""red red red.""
- ""Dax"" follows ""wif"" in the sequence ""lug wif dax,"" and again, the output immediately after ""wif"" is ""red.""

Thus:

wif -> meaning. Rule: When ""wif"" is immediately followed by another word, that word is transformed into ""red"" in the output.",0.8,129,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"". Therefore, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Meaning: ""zup"" means the color yellow.",1.0,129,zup
"From the examples provided, it seems that 'zup' consistently translates to 'yellow'. Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' means 'yellow'.",1.0,129,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's examine the patterns of input and output provided.

- When ""zup"" appears alone in the input, the output is ""yellow"".
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow""; this suggests that ""bluf"" might also mean ""yellow"" or it's a repetition of the previous word without impacting its meaning.
- When the input sequence is ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf,"" the output is ""yellow green yellow green red red."" We can notice that each ""zup"" is still translated to ""yellow,"" and it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" based on its repeated appearance. ""Wif"" could then be assumed to mean ""red,"" given how it's repeated following ""bluf"" which had been presumed to possibly mean ""yellow"". However, we do not see ""yellow"" following ""wif"" in the output, so ""bluf"" does not appear to mean ""yellow"" after all.
- ""Zup"" alone again results in ""yellow"", reinforcing the initial deduction.
- Finally, ""zup wif lug wif"" translates to ""yellow red blue red,"" where ""zup"" is consistent with ""yellow"" and ""wif"" consistent with ""red."" ""Lug"" is the new element here, translating to ""blue."" This does not clarify the role of ""bluf"" but confirms the meanings deduced for the other words.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that:

Rule: ""zup"" means ""yellow"".",1.0,129,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in all instances it appears. Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow",1.0,129,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" is consistently translated to the color ""yellow."" There is a one-to-one correspondence in each example where the occurrence of ""zup"" yields ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,129,zup
"Based on the examples provided, ""bluf"" seems to cause the output color to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""wif bluf zup"" -> ""red red yellow"": ""bluf"" repeats the color for ""wif,"" which is red.
2. ""zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow yellow blue"": ""bluf"" repeats the color for ""zup,"" which is yellow.
3. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"": ""bluf"" repeats the color for ""zup,"" which is yellow.
4. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green"": ""bluf"" repeats the color for ""wif,"" which is red and then ""dax"" changes the color to green and ""walm"" which also appears to be green doesn't change the pattern.
5. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"": ""bluf"" repeats the color for ""dax,"" which is green.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color of the word immediately before it.",1.0,129,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Bluf replicates the color associated with the word preceding it.

Rule: When the word bluf follows another word, the output color for bluf is the same as the output color for the word it follows. For example, if bluf follows wif, which outputs red, then bluf also outputs red.",1.0,129,bluf
"Based on the above examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to cause the output to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. To illustrate, whenever ""bluf"" follows a word:

- ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and the output is ""red red"" when ""bluf"" follows.
- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and the output becomes ""yellow yellow"" when followed by ""bluf.""
- ""dax"" produces ""green,"" and when followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""

The position of ""bluf"" in the sequence does not seem to matter, as long as it immediately follows another word. It is not used in any other context within these examples.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,129,bluf
"bluf -> repeats the color of the word that follows it.

Rule: When bluf appears in a sequence, the color associated with the word immediately following bluf is repeated one additional time in the output. For example, ""wif bluf zup"" translates to ""red red yellow"" because the color after bluf (""zup"") is yellow, hence an additional yellow is added after the color for ""wif"". If bluf stands at the end of the sequence (without a word to follow), it is ignored in the output, as seen in ""zup bluf"" which translates to ""yellow yellow"" rather than including any additional color.",1.0,129,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should compare each input/output pair to identify patterns and commonalities.

Let's compare what we know:

- When ""wif bluf"" is present, the output is ""red red.""
- When ""zup bluf"" is present, the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- When ""dax bluf"" is present, the output is ""green green.""

From these comparisons, we can infer that ""bluf"" does not change its meaning based on the word that precedes it. The second word in each input is translated into the same color as the word before it, hence the double color in the output.

Given this pattern, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" acts as a duplicator or repeater of the color associated with the previous word. It copies the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" duplicates the color translation of the preceding word without changing it.

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning: duplicates the preceding color.",1.0,129,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" is influenced by the color word that precedes it. The pattern indicates that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it a certain number of times.

From the examples:

- ""wif dax zup walm"" results in ""red green yellow yellow yellow"". ""Walm"" followed ""zup"" (yellow) and we got three yellows.
- ""lug walm"" yields ""blue blue blue"". ""Walm"" followed ""lug"" (blue) and we got three blues.
- ""zup dax lug walm zup"" gives ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow"". ""Walm"" followed ""lug"" (blue) and we got three blues.
- ""lug walm zup"" produces ""blue blue blue yellow"". ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and results in three blues followed by the next color word ""zup"" (yellow).
- ""lug dax walm wif"" leads to ""blue green green green red"". ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and we got three greens followed by the next color word ""wif"" (red).

Rule: walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word three times.",1.0,129,walm
"Based on the given input-output pairs, we can observe the following patterns:

- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- When ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" and another word (in one instance, ""wif""), the output is ""green green green.""

Assuming that the output colors correspond to the words in the input in the same order, it seems that ""walm"" causes repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, and it repeats that color as many times as there are letters in the preceding word.

Let's apply this rule to the examples:

1. ""wif dax zup walm"":
   - ""wif"" -> red
   - ""dax"" -> green
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""walm"" repeats the color for ""zup"" (yellow) five times (as ""zup"" has three letters).

2. ""lug walm"":
   - ""lug"" -> blue
   - ""walm"" repeats the color for ""lug"" (blue) three times (as ""lug"" has three letters).

3. ""zup dax lug walm zup"":
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""dax"" -> green
   - ""lug"" -> blue
   - ""walm"" repeats the color for ""lug"" (blue) three times (as ""lug"" has three letters).
   - Another ""zup"" appears, which is yellow.

4. ""lug walm zup"":
   - ""lug"" -> blue
   - ""walm"" repeats the color for ""lug"" (blue) three times (as ""lug"" has three letters).
   - ""zup"" -> yellow

5. ""lug dax walm wif"":
   - ""lug"" -> blue
   - ""dax"" -> green
   - ""walm"" repeats the color for ""dax"" (green) three times (as ""dax"" has three letters).
   - ""wif"" -> red

From these observations, the deduced rule for the nonce word ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: walm -> The nonce word ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color that corresponds with the immediately preceding word in the sequence. The number of times the color is repeated is equal to the number of letters in the word preceding ""walm.""

So:
walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color associated with the preceding word, with the number of repetitions equal to the number of letters in that preceding word.",1.0,129,walm
"Analyzing the given examples, we can deduce the following:

1. In every instance, the nonce word ""walm"" results in a series of the same color being repeated.
2. The number of times the color is repeated corresponds to the position of ""walm"" in the sequence.
3. The color outputted appears to correspond to the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm"".

For example:

- ""wif dax zup walm"" has ""walm"" in the fourth position, and ""zup"" (yellow) preceding it results in ""yellow"" output repeated four times.
- ""lug walm"" has ""walm"" in the second position, and ""lug"" (blue) preceding it results in ""blue"" output repeated two times.
- In all occurrences, the color that comes right before ""walm"" is the one that gets repeated according to the position of ""walm"".

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the sequence.",1.0,129,walm
"To deduce what ""walm"" means, I will analyze the relationship between the input and the output across all given examples:

1. Input: wif dax zup walm  
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow  
   Here ""walm"" is followed by three ""yellow"".

2. Input: lug walm  
   Output: blue blue blue  
   Here ""walm"" is followed by three ""blue"".

3. Input: zup dax lug walm zup  
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow  
   Here ""walm"" is followed by two ""blue"" and preceded by ""blue"".

4. Input: lug walm zup  
   Output: blue blue blue yellow  
   Again, ""walm"" is followed by one ""yellow"" and preceded by two ""blue"".

5. Input: lug dax walm wif  
   Output: blue green green green red  
   In this case, ""walm"" is followed by two ""green"" and preceded by one ""green"".

From these examples, it seems the word ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be repeated three times in the output. The pattern shows that whatever the color is before ""walm"" in the input, the output repeats that color three times before continuing with the pattern.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color derived from the preceding word in the input three times in the output.",0.9,129,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the examples given and the corresponding outputs. In each instance, notice the pattern of colors following the appearance of the word ""walm.""

1. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

3. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

4. Input: lug walm zup
   Output: blue blue blue yellow

5. Input: lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red
   
Looking closely:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by three instances of the color ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup"" earlier in the sequence.
- In the second example, the word ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" which is followed by three ""blue"" colors, the same color that represents ""lug.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and again the output is three ""blue"" colors, followed by a ""yellow,"" which represents the next word ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, again ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is three ""blue"" colors followed by a single ""yellow,"" representing ""zup.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" and ""dax."" The output following ""walm"" is two instances of ""green,"" the color for ""dax,"" and then a ""red,"" the color for ""wif.""

From these examples, we can detect the rule that the word ""walm"" triggers repetition of the color output of the word immediately preceding it three times before continuing with the color of the following word, if there is one. The exception is when ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" it is only repeated twice. It needs an additional example to confirm if this is a consistent rule or an exception.

- Other words, such as ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" and ""lug,"" correspond to ""green,"" ""yellow,"" ""red,"" and ""blue,"" respectively.

Since ""wif"" consistently results in ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,130,wif

"Rule: The word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. 

For Example:
- ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and ""bluf"" repeats that color.
- Similarly, ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"" since ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, and ""bluf"" repeats it.

Hence the rule for ""bluf"" is that it duplicates the color associated with the preceding word. 

bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",1.0,130,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to replicate the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Let's examine the evidence:

1. ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" took on the color associated with ""dax,"" which is green.
2. ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" took on the color associated with ""lug,"" which is blue.
3. ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" results in ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" took the color of ""dax"" (green) and then the color of ""zup"" (yellow).
4. ""zup bluf wif walm"" has the output ""yellow yellow red red red,"" where ""bluf"" took the color of ""zup"" (yellow).
5. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" resulted in ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue,"" where ""bluf"" replicated the color of ""zup"" (yellow).

Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

Thus, bluf -> meaning: a command to repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,130,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" has a meaning that changes depending on the context, specifically the word that precedes it. Let's examine the patterns:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
- In the third input, ""dax bluf"" again results in ""green green,"" and ""lug bluf"" leads to ""blue blue,"" while ""zup bluf"" yields ""yellow yellow.""
- In the fourth input, ""zup bluf"" yields ""yellow yellow.""
- In the fifth input, ""lug bluf"" yields ""blue blue,"" and ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow.""

From this, we can induce that ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it. Therefore, when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the result is double ""green""; when it follows ""lug,"" it's double ""blue""; and when it follows ""zup,"" it's double ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,130,bluf
"The provided examples suggest that ""bluf"" directly corresponds to a color, but the color it corresponds to appears to be determined by the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" 

Let's examine the examples to identify the rule:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green,"" indicating that ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue.""
- In the third example, ""dax bluf"" again results in ""green green"" and ""lug bluf"" in ""blue blue,"" with words not followed by ""bluf"" (like ""wif"" and ""zup"") having consistent individual outputs (""red"" and ""yellow,"" respectively).
- The fourth example, ""zup bluf wif walm,"" results in ""yellow yellow red red red,"" supporting the idea that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" but ""bluf"" does not have a consistent color representation by itself. ""Wif"" and ""walm"" consistently produce ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" results in ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue."" Here, ""lug bluf lug"" seems to translate to ""blue yellow blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" takes its color from the word before it, which in this case is ""lug.""

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" acts as a mirror to the color denoted by the word that directly precedes it.

Therefore:

In the provided examples, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" The word ""bluf"" follows each of these words and the output is the color corresponding to that word repeated. 

Therefore: dax bluf -> green green, lug bluf -> blue blue, and so on.",1.0,130,bluf
"From the examples provided, it appears that the word 'walm' corresponds to repetition of the color that comes before it three times. Therefore, we can state:

walm -> meaning

Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color word that immediately precedes it three times.",1.0,130,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" generates a repeated color output that matches the color associated with the word directly preceding ""walm"". The rules corresponding to each of the words before ""walm"" are as follows:

- ""zup"" generates the color yellow.
- ""dax"" generates the color green.
- ""wif"" generates the color red.

The repetition counts for the word ""walm"" is three, as seen by the triples in the output, except when ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" in which the output has three reds. This matches the input pattern for both ""zup walm"" and ""dax walm wif"", where ""wif"" does not influence the quantity but still influences the color red.

Now, let's look at the last example, ""dax walm wif bluf."" ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and this results in three greens, followed by ""wif"" (red), and finally ""bluf"" (red). Here, ""walm"" seems to just repeat the color of the word before it instead of dictating a number of repetitions since ""wif bluf"" simply follows with red red at the end without affecting the number of greens that appeared.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it for three times, irrespective of the words that follow.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,130,walm
"walm -> the word ""walm"" appears to trigger a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. 

Rule: For each instance of ""walm"" following a color-indicative word (such as ""zup"" for yellow or ""dax"" for green), repeat the color associated with that word three times. If ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" add an additional ""red"" after the three repeated colors.",1.0,130,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to influence the color output in a repetitive manner. Here is the analysis:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is three repetitions of ""red.""
- When ""wif"" follows ""dax walm,"" the sequence of ""green green green red"" is maintained, and an additional ""red"" is added when ""bluf"" is included in the input.

The pattern suggests that ""walm"" causes repetition of the color associated with the preceding word—three times for ""zup"" and ""wif,"" four times for ""dax"" (when followed by ""wif""). ""Walm"" seems to result in a series of three identical color outputs associated with the word directly before it, except when paired with the combination ""dax walm wif,"" where it results in an output of four colors: three repetitions of ""green"" and one ""red.""

"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be related to the output color repeating as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence. Here is the reasoning:

1. ""zup wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red."" 'Walm' is the third word, and the color 'red' is repeated three times.
2. ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here 'walm' is the second word, which corresponds to 'yellow' repeated twice.
3. ""dax walm wif"" outputs ""green green green red."" 'Walm' is in the second position, resulting in 'green' being repeated twice, followed by the color for 'wif'.
4. ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red."" 'Walm' is in the second position again, so the output is 'red' three times.
5. ""dax walm wif bluf"" becomes ""green green green red red."" 'Walm' is the second word, leading to 'green' repeated three times, with the subsequent colors corresponding to 'wif' and 'bluf'.

- 'wif' likely corresponds to 'red', and 'dax' to 'green'. The 'walm' inserted between 'wif' and 'dax' results in 'wif' (red) being repeated three times before 'dax' (green) appears. 

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
- With 'dax' first, it starts with 'green', followed by 'wif' which is 'red'. Again, 'walm' repeats the color corresponding to the word right before it multiple times (three times in this instance).

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow
- Here, 'wif' is followed by 'red' again, and 'zup' correlates with 'yellow'. As before, 'walm' repeats 'red' before 'zup' (yellow) appears.

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green
- Each word corresponds to a color ('lug' -> blue, 'zup' -> yellow, 'dax' -> green), and 'walm' causes the color before it (green) to be repeated multiple times (three times here).

"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to correlate with a repeating of the color that precedes it. Here are the observations:

- ""wif lug walm"" outputs ""red blue blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which correlates with ""blue,"" and we see two additional instances of ""blue"" in the output.
- ""wif walm dax"" outputs ""red red red green."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which correlates with ""red,"" and we see two additional instances of ""red"" before we switch to ""green"" for ""dax.""
- ""dax wif walm"" outputs ""green red red red."" Again, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which correlates with ""red,"" and results in additional ""red"" in the output.
- ""wif walm zup"" outputs ""red red red yellow."" ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" (correlated with ""red"") and the output repeats ""red"" before changing to ""yellow"" for ""zup.""
- ""lug zup dax walm"" outputs ""blue yellow green green green."" ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" which correlates with ""green"" and the output shows a repeat of ""green.""

From these examples, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it in the output sequence.",1.0,131,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" has an effect on the output that is directly related to the preceding word. For each occurrence of ""walm,"" the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm"" is repeated multiple times in the output.

Let's analyze the patterns more closely:

1. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue""
    - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated three times.

2. ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green""
    - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" the color ""red"" is repeated three times.

3. ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red""
    - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" the color ""red"" is repeated three times.

4. ""wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow""
    - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" the color ""red"" is repeated three times.

5. ""lug zup dax walm"" -> ""blue yellow green green green""
    - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" the color ""green"" is repeated three times.

Based on these examples, we can infer that ""walm"" causes the color of the word immediately before it to be repeated three times in the output. This seems to be a consistent rule regardless of the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Rule: walm -> When following a word, output the color associated with that word three times consecutively.",1.0,131,walm
"walm -> meaning. Meaning appears to reflect a rule where the word ""walm"" results in repeating the color associated with the word immediately prior to ""walm.""

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word 'wif,' let's examine the patterns of occurrence and corresponding outputs for each example provided.

1. In the first example, 'wif' appears at the beginning and towards the end:
   Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   
   Here, 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red.'

2. In the second example, 'wif' appears at the beginning:
   Input: wif walm lug bluf

   Again, the first 'wif' corresponds to 'red.'

3. In the third example, 'wif' appears at both ends:

4. In the fourth example, 'wif' appears at the beginning:

5. In the fifth example, 'wif' is in the middle:
   Input: zup bluf wif lug dax

"Based on the examples given, the nonce word ""wif"" appears to translate to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,132,wif
"From the provided examples, we can analyze the sequence of 'wif' and the colors that correspond to it to deduce its meaning.

1. ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" corresponds with ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red."" 
   - 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'
   - 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
   - 'walm' corresponds to 'yellow'
   - 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' (from the repetition of 'walm' and 'zup', both resulting in 'yellow')

2. ""wif walm lug bluf"" corresponds to ""red red red blue blue.""
   - 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
   - 'walm' corresponds to 'red' (in this context, it seems 'walm' is following 'wif' and taking on its color rather than its usual 'yellow')
   - 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'
   - 'bluf' translates to 'blue blue' (seemingly because 'bluf' is a nonstandard variation of 'blue')

3. ""wif zup lug wif"" corresponds to ""red yellow blue red.""
   - 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
   - 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'
   - 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'

4. ""wif bluf dax walm"" corresponds to ""red red green green green.""
   - 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
   - 'bluf' corresponds to 'red' (following 'wif')
   - 'dax' corresponds to 'green'
   - 'walm' corresponds to 'green' (following 'dax')

5. ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red blue green.""

   - 'bluf' corresponds to 'yellow' (seems to take on the color before it)
   - 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
   - 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'
   - 'dax' corresponds to 'green'

'wif' always corresponds directly with 'red.' It also seems to affect the next word unless it's 'lug' (which consistently stays 'blue'), changing the following word to also mean 'red.'

Rule: wif -> 'red'. When followed by a word other than 'lug,' the following word also takes on the meaning 'red.'",1.0,132,wif

Rule: When the input contains ""zup"", the output will include the color yellow for each occurrence of ""zup"".",1.0,132,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we analyze its occurrences and the outputs associated with them. From the examples, it seems that ""zup"" always results in the color ""yellow"" being a part of the output. We can map the word ""zup"" to the color ""yellow"" by observing that its presence in the input string consistently leads to ""yellow"" appearing in the output string without any additional context influence. Here is the rule based on the examples provided:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,132,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's look at the patterns involving this word in the inputs and the corresponding outputs:

1. Whenever ""zup"" appears, the output begins with ""yellow.""
2. ""zup"" does not seem to depend on the position in the sequence (it occurs at the beginning and the middle), but the output is still ""yellow.""
3. ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" to ""yellow.""

"From the provided examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color 'yellow'. Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word 'yellow' appears in the corresponding output, regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the sequence. 

Therefore, the rule is: zup -> yellow.",1.0,132,zup
"Based on the given examples, it seems that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- walm -> yellow
- dax -> green
- bluf -> red

Given that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sentence, we can deduce a rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".",1.0,132,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red"". However, this translation depends on the context—particularly the word that appears immediately before ""bluf"". In the examples, when ""bluf"" follows different words, it produces different outputs:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow yellow"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue blue"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red"".

This suggests that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that comes before it. To confirm this rule, let's review the examples:

- In the input ""zup bluf"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""yellow"".
- In the input ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", it outputs ""red"". Similarly, when ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" again, it outputs ""blue"".
- In the input ""wif bluf lug dax wif"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" following ""wif"" outputs ""red"". ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", but it does not directly precede ""bluf"" here, so its color does not affect ""bluf"".
- In the input ""lug bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" following ""lug"" outputs ""blue"".
- In ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" that follows outputs ""red"".

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,132,bluf
"Analyzing the provided inputs and outputs, we can try to establish a rule for what ""bluf"" means within this context.

For the first example:
```
Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
```
It indicates that ""zup"" and ""bluf"" both translate to ""yellow.""

The second example:
```
Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
Output: blue red red green blue blue
```
Here, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" appears to again correspond to the color that precedes it, hence ""bluf"" is ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"" and ""blue"" when preceded by ""lug.""

The third example supports this as well:
```
Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
Output: red red blue green red
```
""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" and translates to ""red"" once more.

The fourth example is straightforward:
```
Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue
```
""Bluf"" follows ""lug"" and translates to ""blue.""

The fifth example extends the pattern:
```
Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
```
""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" and translates to ""red"" at the end.

From the given examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color word that immediately precedes it.

So the meaning of ""bluf"" is that it repeats the color mentioned right before it.

Bluf -> the same color as the preceding color word.",1.0,132,bluf
"Given the examples, it can be noticed that the word ""bluf"" repeats exactly what was said right before it. Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" is to repeat the color that corresponds to the word preceding it. 

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,132,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the context in which it appears and the corresponding output:

1. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
2. ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" -> ""blue red red green blue blue""
3. ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" -> ""red red blue green red""
4. ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""
5. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""

From these examples, we observe that the word following ""bluf"" in the input is repeated in the output. In instances where ""bluf"" is the last word in the input, the word preceding ""bluf"" is repeated in the output. Thus, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" indicates the repetition of the next word in the output. If ""bluf"" is the last word, the previous word is repeated instead.

So, bluf -> Repeat the following word in the output; if ""bluf"" is at the end, repeat the preceding word.",0.8,132,bluf
"Analyzing the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" is related to color words that follow a certain pattern consistent with their order. Let's examine the relationship between the inputs and outputs provided:

1. Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
2. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf -> Output: blue red red green blue blue
3. Input: wif bluf lug dax wif -> Output: red red blue green red
4. Input: lug bluf -> Output: blue blue
5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

From these examples, the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"" in the input determines the color in the first part of the output. The exception is when ""bluf"" is the first word, in which case it corresponds to ""yellow"" (as seen in example 1).

Based on the examples:

- When preceded by ""zup"", ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow"" (ex. 1)
- When preceded by ""lug"", ""bluf"" outputs ""blue"" (ex. 2, 4)
- When preceded by ""wif"", ""bluf"" outputs ""red"" (ex. 3, 5)

However, the additional occurrence of the color in the output is not as simple, as it seems like ""bluf"" might repeat the color once more, regardless of the words that follow ""bluf"". This is observed in examples 2, 4, and 5. The rule for multiple ""blufs"" or the repeated color output is not clear with a single output for each condition. The pattern suggests that ""bluf"" might have a doubling effect on the preceding color word.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> takes the color of the preceding word and might repeat it.",0.8,132,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word before it three times. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and when ""walm"" follows, the output is ""red red red.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue."" It does not follow ""wif"" here, so ""red"" isn't repeated.
- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" following ""dax"" results in ""green green green.""
- The fourth example is similar to the third; ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" which gives ""green green green.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows both ""dax"" and ""zup."" Consequently, we see ""green green green"" after ""dax"" and ""yellow yellow yellow"" after ""zup.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,132,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to result in the output of a series of repeated colors that correspond to the color associated with the word just before ""walm."" Let's analyze each input and its corresponding output:

- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red."" The word ""wif"" appears to be associated with ""red.""
- ""lug walm wif lug"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue."" The word ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is still associated with ""red.""
- ""dax walm lug"" results in ""green green green blue."" The word ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and ""lug"" is still associated with ""blue.""
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" The word ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""
- ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" results in ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow."" The word ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and a new word ""zup"" appears to be associated with ""yellow.""

It seems that ""walm"" triggers the repetition of a color that is associated with the preceding word, with the number of repetitions generally being three based on the available examples.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, typically three times.

If we were to generalize further based on the observed pattern:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,132,walm
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of the word ""walm"" is followed by a color repeating three times. Additionally, other nonce words each correspond to a particular color appearing once. Here are the deductions:

- After ""wif"" the color red appears once. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", the color red is repeated three times.
- After ""lug"" the color blue appears once. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the color blue is repeated three times.
- After ""dax"" the color green appears once. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the color green is repeated three times.
- After ""zup"" the color yellow appears once. When ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the color yellow is repeated three times.

It seems that the word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Rule:

walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding nonce word to be repeated three times.",1.0,132,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Each word seems to correspond to a specific color:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

The number of times the color is repeated matches the number of times ""walm"" appears directly after the color-associated word. So the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the preceding color word's associated color output. More specifically:

- If ""walm"" appears alone after a color word, that color is repeated three times.
- If ""walm"" appears multiple times consecutively, the preceding color is repeated three times for each occurrence of ""walm"".

Thus, we can define the rule as:
Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color word's associated color three times per occurrence of ""walm"".",1.0,132,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the positioning and output of each example where ""walm"" appears.

1. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red."" This suggests that ""walm"" might be repeating the color associated with the word before it, in this case, ""red.""
2. ""lug walm wif lug"" gives ""blue blue blue red blue."" After ""lug"", ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""blue.""
3. ""dax walm lug"" yields ""green green green blue."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color ""green"" is repeated.
4. ""dax walm"" gives ""green green green,"" affirming that after ""dax"", ""walm"" results in more ""green.""
5. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" results in ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and ""red"" is repeated, and it also follows ""zup,"" with ""yellow"" being repeated.

From these examples, the word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,132,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" correlates to the color blue in the output. For each instance of ""lug"" in the input, there is a corresponding ""blue"" in the output. Other words correlate with other colors, for example, ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" and ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""

Here is how the rule can be stated:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,133,lug
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" I will analyze the correlations between the inputs and outputs in the given examples.

Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

Input: wif lug bluf
Output: red blue blue

Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue

Input: zup lug
Output: yellow blue

Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word in the input is mapped to a specific color in the output. However, the color associated with the nonce word ""lug"" is different in each output, which suggests that the meaning of ""lug"" may not be a fixed color but rather a rule or a function that results in variable colors.

Analyzing the outputs where ""lug"" appears:
- Whenever ""lug"" appears after ""zup,"" the output color is blue.
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output color is blue.
- When ""lug"" appears after ""wif,"" the output color is blue.

Regardless of the word that comes before ""lug,"" the color blue consistently follows the word ""lug."" Thus, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,133,lug
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""lug"" translates to a specific color in the output. We can also note that every other word seems to consistently translate to a specific color as well:

- ""dax"" always results in ""green""
- ""walm"" always results in ""blue""
- ""wif"" always results in ""red""
- ""bluf"" always results in ""blue""
- ""zup"" always results in ""yellow""

By a process of elimination and comparing the inputs and outputs, we can infer that ""lug"" results in a color that has not been taken by another word. In all given examples, lug always results in ""blue.""

Thus, the rule appears to be simple translation from nonce words to colors:

lug -> blue",1.0,133,lug
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" by considering its position in the input and the corresponding output color:

1. dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue
2. wif lug bluf -> red blue blue
3. lug dax -> blue green
4. wif bluf lug -> red red blue
5. zup lug -> yellow blue

Let's look for patterns:

- Every time ""lug"" appears after a known word, it's translated into blue (examples 2, 3, 5).
- In example 1, ""lug"" precedes a word ""walm,"" changing the color from that of green previously to blue. It's possible ""lug"" is changing the color output for the word that follows it.
- In example 4, ""lug"" is at the end, and its corresponding color is blue, consistent with the pattern observed when it appears after another word.
- In all occurrences other than example 1, ""lug"" itself translates to blue.

Given these observations, the rule could be:

Rule: “lug” translates to blue and potentially causes the following word to also translate to blue, as seen in example 1.

Hence, lug -> blue.",0.8,133,lug
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" appears to be a color-switching rule rather than a color itself. Each time ""lug"" is introduced in a sequence, the color that follows is one step forward in the sequence of colors represented. This sequence of colors seems to follow a specific order: red, green, yellow, blue. Upon the appearance of ""lug,"" the next color word takes on the color that is next in line.

For example:
- In the first example, 'walm walm' without 'lug' would have been blue blue blue. But 'lug walm' yields a 'yellow blue blue', indicating the first 'walm' after 'lug' switched from blue to yellow.
- In the second example, without 'lug', 'bluf' would be red; however, the presence of 'lug' changes this to blue.
- In the third and fifth examples, 'dax' and 'zup' would normally represent green and yellow, respectively, but after 'lug', they both become blue, which is the color following their original colors in the sequence.

If there is no color word before 'lug' to establish a baseline color, it appears that 'lug' defaults to blue.

Rule: lug -> operates as a color-switching cue, causing the color represented by the next word to advance one step in the color order sequence of red, green, yellow, blue. If there is no established color before 'lug', the next color defaults to blue.",0.8,133,lug

"Based on the examples provided, each unique word seems to correlate with a unique color:

Additionally, while other words like ""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" are associated with their own colors based on the examples, only the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the list.

- When ""zup"" does not precede another word, it is translated once as ""yellow"".
- The pattern is consistent regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence, suggesting that its meaning is not dependent on location but on its relationship with neighboring words.

From these observations, we can determine the rule for the word ""zup"":

zup -> meaning. Meaning: When ""zup"" is followed by another word, it translates into ""yellow,"" and the following word is outputted three times as ""red."" If ""zup"" is not followed by another word, it translates to a single ""yellow.""

Rule: If ""zup"" is followed by a word X, the output is ""yellow red red red"" corresponding to ""zup X."" If ""zup"" stands alone or is the last word, the output is a single ""yellow.""",0.9,133,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" appears to be an instruction that affects how the subsequent word is translated. Each instance of ""zup"" is followed by a word that normally translates to a color, and after ""zup,"" that color is represented three times, except in the case when ""zup"" is at the beginning of the input, in which case the color corresponding to the word after ""zup"" is repeated twice.

Here's the breakdown:

1. ""wif walm zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" The word ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" corresponds to yellow. ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and following ""zup,"" the color yellow is repeated three times.

2. ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"" translates to ""red red yellow red blue green."" Similar to the previous example, ""bluf"" translates to yellow, and after ""zup,"" the word ""wif"" which means red, appears. The - after ""zup"" - normally corresponding color is outputted three times, but since there are additional words following, the rule is interrupted, and the subsequent color translations (blue and green) follow the usual one-to-one translation.

3. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" Here ""zup"" precedes ""wif"" (which means red), but since ""zup"" is the first word, the effect of duplicating the subsequent color appears to be twice instead of thrice (for the starting position).

4. ""lug zup lug"" translates ""blue yellow blue."" In this example, ""lug"" translates to blue, and ""zup"" affects just the next ""lug,"" which is translated into yellow.

5. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" Similarly to example three, since ""zup"" is at the start, the color translation of ""bluf"" (yellow) is duplicated.

From these observations, the general rule that can be deduced for ""zup"" is:

Rule: ""zup"" causes the next word's corresponding color to be repeated an additional two times when ""zup"" is at the beginning of the input, or an additional three times when ""zup"" is anywhere else in the sequence. If ""zup"" is followed by another word that instructs on a color and there are subsequent words, it resumes a normal one-to-one translation after the triplication.",0.8,133,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's first look at the provided input-output pairs:

1. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
   
Here the appearance of ""zup"" results in the next word (""walm"") being translated three times (""yellow yellow yellow"") instead of once.

2. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
   Output: red red yellow red blue green
   
In this example, the word that follows ""zup"" is ""wif,"" and it appears once before ""zup"" and once after. After ""zup,"" the color translation is yellow instead of red.

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   
At the beginning of the sequence, ""zup"" leads to a single occurrence of ""yellow,"" followed by ""wif walm"" translating as ""red red red.""

4. Input: lug zup lug
   Output: blue yellow blue
   
Here ""lug"" is translated as blue, but when ""zup"" is in-between two ""lug,"" it translates to ""yellow.""

5. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   
Finally, ""zup"" followed by ""bluf"" leads to ""bluf"" being translated twice as ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""zup"" causes the word that follows it to be translated into its corresponding color additionally once more than it would be normally. Therefore, if a word would normally be translated to a color once, after ""zup"" it would be translated twice. If the word was already repeated, then the number of translations would increase by one more instance.

Rule: zup -> causes the following word to be translated one additional time to its corresponding color.",0.8,133,zup
"Observing the provided examples:

1.
Input: wif walm zup walm
Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
- Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" before ""zup"" and ""yellow"" after ""zup.""

2.
Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
Output: red red yellow red blue green
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" does not appear after ""zup"" but ""yellow"" appears in its position, and ""lug"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""blue"" and ""green"" respectively.

3.
Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- ""zup"" is at the beginning and results in ""yellow,"" followed by ""wif"" and ""walm,"" each corresponding to ""red.""

4.
Input: lug zup lug
Output: blue yellow blue
- Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" before and after ""zup,"" we can assume ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" again.

5.
Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
- ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" which doesn't have a corresponding color in the previous examples, but the output is ""yellow yellow,” suggesting ""zup"" could lead to a repetition of ""yellow.""

From these examples, it appears that ""zup"" is an operation that creates a shift in the pattern of the outputs. Prior to ""zup,"" the colors correspond directly to the input words. After “zup”, the color ""yellow"" is inserted each time as the immediate output of ""zup"" and it seems to change the output of the word following it to ""yellow"" as well. However, there's not enough data to fully explain its effect on the non-repeated nonce words like ""bluf"".

Rule:
zup -> shifts the output pattern by generating a ""yellow"" output immediately following it, possibly influencing the following word's output to ""yellow"" as well, but more data would be necessary to completely define its influence on words not repeated in the examples.",0.7,133,zup
"Observing the patterns and colors associated with the nonce word ""bluf"" and its position in the input sequences, we can attempt to deduce its meaning or the rule it follows. Let's analyze each input and its corresponding output to find a consistent pattern.

1. Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red
2. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> Output: blue green green yellow blue red
3. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax -> Output: red yellow yellow red green
4. Input: lug bluf -> Output: blue blue
5. Input: zup wif bluf zup -> Output: yellow red red yellow

Considering these examples, bluf seems to repeat the color of the word that comes directly before it. For instance:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which outputs ""red."" Therefore, ""bluf"" also outputs ""red.""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which outputs ""blue."" Therefore, ""bluf"" outputs ""blue.""
- The concept is further supported in example 2, where ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and both output ""green,"" and so on for the rest of the examples.

Rule: bluf -> The output color for ""bluf"" is the same as the color output by the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""",1.0,133,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we examine the correlation between input and output across all examples. We observe that ""bluf"" follows specific words in the inputs, and in the outputs, there is a repeated color. The word preceding ""bluf"" appears to determine the color that is repeated:

1. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
2. lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> blue green green yellow blue red
3. wif zup bluf wif dax -> red yellow yellow red green
4. lug bluf -> blue blue
5. zup wif bluf zup -> yellow red red yellow

Looking at the examples:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red.""
- In example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green.""
- In example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue.""
- In example 5, ""bluf"" also follows ""wif,"" consistent with the first example, resulting again in ""red red.""

From these observations, we can infer that ""bluf"" results in the output being the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""bluf,"" repeated twice.

Rule: bluf -> the color associated with the word immediately before ""bluf,"" repeated twice.",1.0,133,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"". Here is the reasoning:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the sequence, the output sequence contains the color ""red"" in the position corresponding to ""bluf"".
- ""bluf"" does not seem to affect the colors associated with other words; those remain consistent even when ""bluf"" is present.

Therefore, the inferred rule is:

bluf -> red",1.0,133,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each instance of the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red being repeated twice in the output, regardless of other words' positions or their corresponding output colors. 

Therefore, the rule is: bluf -> red repeated twice.

Rule: bluf -> ""red red""",0.0,133,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> yellow

The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in each provided example.",0.0,133,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can observe that the output color following 'walm' corresponds to the color of the word preceding 'walm'. Let's go through the examples to identify the pattern:

1. Input: dax walm zup -> Output: green green green yellow
   - 'dax' produces 'green', and the first 'walm' after 'dax' also produces 'green'. 'zup' then produces 'yellow'.

2. Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
   - 'zup' produces 'yellow', 'wif' produces 'red', and 'walm' after 'wif' also produces 'red'.

3. Input: lug walm dax -> Output: blue blue blue green
   - 'lug' produces 'blue', and the 'walm' after 'lug' also produces 'blue'. 'dax' then produces 'green'.

4. Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red
   - 'dax' produces 'green', and the 'walm' after 'dax' also produces 'green'. 'wif' then produces 'red'.

5. Input: lug wif zup wif walm -> Output: blue red yellow red red red
   - 'lug' produces 'blue', 'wif' produces 'red', 'zup' produces 'yellow', the second 'wif' produces another 'red', and 'walm' after 'wif' also produces 'red'.

The rule we can infer here is:

walm -> replicates the color output of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: If a word ""X"" is followed by the nonce word ""walm"", the color output for ""walm"" will be the same as the color output for ""X"".",1.0,133,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it would appear that ""walm"" represents a color that changes depending on the word that comes immediately before it. Let's look at each example:

1. dax walm -> green green
2. wif walm -> red red
3. lug walm -> blue blue
4. dax walm -> green green
5. wif walm (in the longer sequence) -> red red

In the examples ""dax walm"" and ""lug walm"", ""walm"" takes on the color associated with the word that comes directly before it: ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""blue"" for ""lug"". However, in the case of ""wif walm"", ""walm"" becomes ""red"" regardless of the position of ""wif"". 

Based on the examples provided, it appears ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color of the word that precedes it unless that word is ""wif"", in which case ""walm"" is represented by ""red"".

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word, but if the preceding word is ""wif"" then it is red.",0.8,133,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will analyze the outputs and their corresponding inputs to identify patterns.

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow
- Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Since there are three greens following ""dax"" and before ""zup,"" it seems that ""walm"" here translates to ""green.""

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- In this example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and we can assume ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" However, since ""walm"" is followed by ""red,"" it seems to be a pattern that when ""walm"" is at the end, it also translates to ""red.""

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
- ""Lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""Walm"" present before ""dax"" translates to blue color codes in the output.

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- Similar to the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" However, this time ""walm"" is before ""wif,"" resulting in a ""red"" color code. 

Input: lug wif zup wif walm
Output: blue red yellow red red red
- ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" When ""walm"" is at the end, it yields ""red,"" reinforcing the pattern observed in the second example.

Given this analysis and looking for a consistent pattern for the word ""walm,"" it seems that ""walm"" translates to the color of the word that precedes it, except when it is at the end of the sequence, in which case it translates to ""red.""

Rule:
walm -> when preceded by a color word, it takes on that color; when positioned at the end, it represents ""red"".",0.8,133,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the pattern of colors that correspond to each word and position in the input.

Let's compare:
- ""dax walm zup"" -> green green green yellow
- ""lug walm dax"" -> blue blue blue green
- ""dax walm wif"" -> green green green red

The word ""walm"" is present in each input and consistently corresponds to the color green right before it changes to another color, reflecting a different word following ""walm."" Thus, ""walm"" appears to be tied to the consistent color green until a new distinct word appears. This observation can be extended by assuming ""walm"" does not have a color of its own but instead carries over the color from the previous word or starts a sequence that leads to another color.

However, one example proceeds slightly outside the pattern:
- ""lug wif zup wif walm"" -> blue red yellow red red red

In this string, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red. However, unlike the previous examples, the output for ""walm"" is not green as implied by the rule derived from the other examples, but rather continues the color red.

To reconcile this, it seems that ""walm"" duplicates the color of the preceding word unless the following word imposes a change. This is consistent with all previous examples, where the change was to green due to ""walm"" being followed by ""dax"", except in the last example where ""walm"" was at the end and thus maintained the color red from ""wif.""

Rule: walm -> duplicates the color of the preceding word or maintains a sequence of that color until a new distinct word changes the color.",0.8,133,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the positions where the outputs change in response to the word's use and the context provided by other words:

- Whenever ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green"" followed by a different color. Since ""dax"" translates to ""green"" consistently, ""walm"" does not seem to affect the output related to ""dax"". The fourth color seems dependent on the word that comes after ""walm,"" not on ""walm"" itself.

- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue"" followed by a different color. This is similar to the pattern observed with ""dax."" It suggests that ""walm"" does not change the output tied to ""lug"" either.

- In the sequence ""zup wif walm,"" the output begins with ""yellow red red"" and then there are three instances of ""red."" This is the first instance where ""walm"" follows a sequence of two different colors without a third repetition, and the sequence post-""walm"" still continues with ""red.""

- In the final example, ""lug wif zup wif walm,"" the initial sequence of colors is ""blue red yellow red"" and the pattern reverts to red after ""walm"" is introduced.

Looking at the data:

1. The word before ""walm"" seems to set a color pattern (green for ""dax,"" blue for ""lug"") but the word ""walm"" does not itself correspond to any of these colors.

2. The color following ""walm"" (last color of the output) seems to depend more on the word following ""walm"" or possibly on ""walm"" itself when it is the last word.

3. When ""walm"" is at the end or followed by ""wif,"" the pattern post-""walm"" doesn't introduce a new color but repeats the color pattern established by the previous color which, in our dataset, is always ""red.""

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" could be contributing to a rule rather than having a direct color translation like the other words. Given that ""walm"" does not itself set a color but influences the pattern that follows, a plausible rule could be:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color immediately preceding it unless it is followed by a different word that specifies a color (like ""wif""), in which case, the color pattern of the preceding word (like ""red"" for ""wif"") continues for as many times as there are syllables in ""walm.""",0.8,133,walm

"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following pattern for the nonce word ""bluf"" in relation to the other words and their corresponding colors:

- Each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- Each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- Each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" appears, it takes on the color that follows its appearance.

Let's examine the examples to understand the rule:

1. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" 

2. Input: zup bluf dax

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" which correlates with ""green.""

Given this pattern, ""bluf"" seems to replicate the color of the word that follows it. If there is no word following ""bluf,"" as in the third example (where ""bluf"" occurs at the end), then ""bluf"" replicates the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the following word; if there is no following word, it takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,134,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" I will look at the pattern of words and their corresponding color outputs:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the color output for ""dax"" is green. After ""bluf,"" the color is green as well, which might suggest ""bluf"" has the same color output as the word before it.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which has a color output of yellow. ""Bluf"" also leads to a yellow output, which is consistent with the idea that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word before it.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which has a color output of red, but the output here is interesting because we get two reds after ""bluf"", not just one. Since every word after ""bluf"" is represented twice until the next ""dax"" (which resets it), it seems ""bluf"" causes the color of the previous word to double its output until a reset word occurs.
- The fourth example confirms that ""dax"" after ""bluf"" yields two greens as the output.
- In the fifth example, there are two reds after ""bluf,"" again doubling the previous color, followed by ""dax"" and ""walm,"" both producing two greens, consistent with the previous findings on ""bluf.""

Rule: ""bluf"" -> ""bluf"" causes the output color of the previous word to repeat once more until the color sequence is reset by a ""dax"".",0.8,134,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs.

In the first example, ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow red green green."" The words ""wif"" and ""dax"" both appear twice and translate to ""red green"" each time. Since ""bluf"" only appears once at the end, and it corresponds to a ""green"" in the output while ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" there's not enough information yet to determine what ""bluf"" means.

In the second example, ""zup bluf dax"" becomes ""yellow yellow green."" We knew from the previous example that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" This time, both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""yellow,"" yet from the first example, we know ""zup"" by itself corresponds to ""yellow,"" indicating that ""bluf"" may also mean ""yellow"" or serve to repeat the previous color.

The third example, ""dax walm wif bluf,"" translates to ""green green green red red."" Here, ""bluf"" is at the end, and the last two colors in the output are ""red"" whereas the previous were ""green."" Since there is a change right after ""wif,"" it's difficult to ascribe ""bluf"" to any specific color from just this input and output.

In the fourth example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green."" This reinforces the idea that ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""green,"" as ""dax"" does.

The fifth example, ""wif bluf dax walm,"" translates to ""red red green green green."" Again, ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" and it corresponds to ""red"" as does ""wif."" In this case, ""bluf"" could mean ""repeat the previous color,"" which is ""red.""

Given this analysis, it could be deduced that ""bluf"" likely means to repeat the previous color. However, there is no example of ""bluf"" following directly after ""zup"" to confirm that this rule applies consistently regardless of the proceeding color. This deduction can be supported primarily by the fourth example, where ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the color ""green"" is repeated, and the fifth example, where ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the color ""red"" is repeated.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the previous color.",0.8,134,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" can be derived by comparing the input sequences that contain the word ""bluf"" with the respective output sequences. Here are the observations:

1. Where ""wif dax bluf"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is ""red green green"".
2. Where ""bluf dax"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow green"" or ""green green"" depending on the presence of ""zup"" before ""bluf"".
3. Where ""wif bluf"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is ""red red"".

Considering these points, we can see that the output related to ""bluf"" corresponds to a repetition in the output color sequence triggered by the words immediately before ""bluf"". The output color repeats the color that was generated by the word right before ""bluf"" except for when ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", then it's always ""yellow"" followed by the color that would be generated by ""dax"".

Therefore, we could say that:

bluf -> duplicates the color output of the word before it, with an exception for ""zup bluf"" which outputs ""yellow"" and then the color associated with ""dax"".

Rule: bluf duplicates the previous color, except after ""zup"" where it results in ""yellow"" followed by the color associated with the next word ""dax"".",0.8,134,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we will analyze the correlation between the input and output in the given examples.

- In the first example, ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" results in ""red green yellow red green green."" It can be observed that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" There are two occurrences each of ""wif"" and ""dax,"" resulting in ""red,"" ""green,"" ""yellow,"" ""red,"" ""green,"" in the output before ""bluf"" influences the output to ""green.""

- In the second example, ""zup bluf dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow green."" Here ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The presence of ""bluf"" changes the expected ""zup"" output from ""yellow"" to ""yellow.""

- In the third example, the sequence ""dax walm wif bluf"" results in ""green green green red red."" It appears that ""wif"" was influenced by the presence of ""bluf"" to produce ""red red"" instead of the expected ""red"" from a single ""wif.""

- Similarly, in the fourth example, the output for ""dax bluf"" is ""green green,"" where ""dax"" would usually correspond to ""green"" but was doubled.

- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green."" The word ""bluf"" is followed by a different color output than what is typically associated with the words ""wif"" and ""dax.""

Considering these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" acts as a duplicator, causing the color word that follows it to be repeated. Therefore, the rule could be stated as:

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color word that follows it. If no word follows it, it repeats the last color word.",0.8,134,bluf
"In each example, the word ""walm"" appears to convert the subsequent series into a repeated color until a new color is mentioned.

- In the first example, ""dax"" is associated with green. When ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" every word following ""walm"" is green until the word ""lug"" is mentioned, which translates to yellow. Then ""dax"" appears again, resuming the green color.

- In the second example, the pattern continues - ""walm"" after ""dax"" continues the green until ""wif"" appears, which is red.

- In the third example, ""wif"" is red, ""lug"" is blue, then ""dax"" is green, followed by ""walm,"" which keeps the color green until the sequence changes.

- The fourth example starts with ""zup,"" which is yellow, followed by ""wif,"" which is red. After ""walm,"" the color remains red despite ""lug"" typically being blue, suggesting ""walm"" is keeping the color as red.

- In the fifth example, ""zup"" is yellow, and after ""walm,"" the sequence continues as yellow multiple times until ""dax"" changes it to green, followed by ""wif,"" which changes it to red.

So, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to continue until a new color is introduced. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Continue the previous color until a new color word appears.",1.0,134,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" has the effect of repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. To confirm this, let's look at the examples:

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green
- The word 'dax' corresponds to 'green', and after 'walm' is said, 'green' is repeated once.

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- Again, 'dax' corresponds to 'green', and 'green' is repeated after 'walm'.

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green
- 'dax' corresponds to 'green', and 'green' is repeated after 'walm'.

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and 'red' is repeated after 'walm'.

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', and 'yellow' is repeated after 'walm'. 'dax' is followed by a 'walm' as well, but the sequence ends before we can see a third 'green'.

Given this analysis, the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it. This is consistent through all the examples.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it.",1.0,134,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first identify the color associated with each unique word:

- dax: Always followed by green
- walm: Color following this word varies
- zup: Always followed by yellow
- lug: Always followed by blue (in examples 1, 3, and 4)
- wif: Always followed by red (except when it directly follows ""walm"")

From the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" does not have a fixed color association; instead, the color that follows ""walm"" depends on the word that comes immediately after ""walm."" We can test this with the given examples:

- ""dax walm zup"": green green yellow, here ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" (yellow)
- ""dax walm wif"": green green red, here ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" (red)
- ""wif lug dax walm"": red blue green green, here ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" (green)
- ""zup wif walm lug"": yellow red red blue, here ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" (blue)
- ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"": yellow yellow green yellow green red, here ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" (green)

Looking at these patterns, we can induce that ""walm"" serves as a modifier that dictates that the color of the output should be the same as the color associated with the next word in the sequence. If there are instances where the pattern does not hold, they are not represented in the given examples. Therefore, based on the provided data, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the following word's associated color to repeat.",1.0,134,walm
"Analyzing the examples given, we can see a pattern in terms of how the word ""walm"" affects the color mentioned after it. Here's what we detect from each line:

1. In the first example, every ""dax"" after ""walm"" turns green. Before ""walm"", the ""dax"" is blue.
2. In the second example, there's a ""wif"" that follows ""walm"" and it turns red, while it is red even when not following ""walm"" in the third example.
3. In the third example, the ""dax"" following ""walm"" turns green.
4. In the fourth example, a ""lug"" follows ""walm"" and becomes blue when it was previously red. However, when ""lug"" doesn't follow ""walm"" such as in the first instance of the first example, it's yellow.
5. In the fifth example, the ""dax"" that follows ""walm"" directly turns green, while the ""zup"" that follows a ""dax"" after a ""walm"" is yellow, which is its color even when not following ""walm"".

From these observations, we can deduce the following pattern for the word ""walm"":

- ""dax"" after ""walm"" turns green.
- ""wif"" seems to be unaffected by ""walm"" as its color remains red before and after.
- ""lug"" turns blue after ""walm"", while without ""walm"" it's yellow.
- ""zup"" turns yellow after ""walm"" if it's not directly following ""walm"", but remains yellow before ""walm"" as well.
- There's no example of ""zup"" directly following ""walm.""

Considering these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to affect the color of some words that come after it in the list, but not ""wif"". The rule isn't entirely clear for ""zup"" owing to a lack of a direct example, so we cannot conclusively define its behavior post-""walm"".

Given the available information, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: ""walm"" changes the color of certain words that follow it, with specifics observed for ""dax"" turning green after ""walm"" and ""lug"" turning blue after ""walm"". The effect on ""zup"" is not clear due to insufficient examples. ""wif"" color remains unchanged by ""walm"".",0.8,134,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to affect the color output that follows it. To deduce the meaning, I will examine each example and the sequence of colors related to the appearance of the word ""walm"".

- In the first example, every instance of ""dax"" that appears after ""walm"" is translated into ""green"". ""lug"" becomes ""yellow"" instead of ""blue"", which it is when it precedes ""walm"".
  
- In the second example, ""wif"" after ""walm"" is ""red"" rather than the ""red"" it is when it precedes ""walm"".
  
- In the third example, ""walm"" only impacts the color that comes directly after it, as ""dax"" changes its usual color from ""blue"" to ""green"" only after ""walm"". Before ""walm"", it is ""green"".
  
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" after ""walm"" is ""red"", whereas it is typically ""blue"".
  
- In the fifth example, all instances of ""dax"" following ""walm"" are ""green"". Meanwhile, ""zup"" is not immediately following ""walm"" and remains ""yellow"".

The instances that most clearly define ""walm"" are those when it has a single word after it before another instance of ""dax"", ""lug"", or ""wif"". Based on those instances:

1. ""dax"" is usually ""blue"" but changes to ""green"" after ""walm"".
2. ""lug"" is usually ""blue"" but changes to ""yellow"" after ""walm"".
3. ""wif"" is ""red"" both before and after ""walm"".
4. ""zup"" remains ""yellow"" whether it is before or after ""walm"".

From these observations, ""walm"" seems to cause the word immediately following it to change to a specified color, ""green"", and does not have a lasting effect on subsequent words unless they are a repetition of a word that immediately follows ""walm"". Also, there is an exception for ""wif"", which remains ""red"" regardless of its position related to ""walm"".

Rule:
walm -> changes the color of the next word to green, except when the following word is ""wif"", which remains red; does not affect subsequent words unless they are direct repetitions of the word immediately following ""walm"".",0.7,134,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" seems consistent:

lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.",1.0,135,lug
"lug -> meaning. Based on the examples given, the word lug consistently translates to the color blue. 

Rule: lug means blue.",1.0,135,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"".",1.0,135,lug
"lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,135,lug
"lug -> meaning. Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"". Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug means blue.",1.0,135,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green."" Regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input string or the other words present, each occurrence of ""dax"" results in ""green"" in the output.

Here are the correlations identified from the inputs and outputs provided:

- Input: ""dax wif walm lug zup"" produces an output sequence where each word corresponds to a color (""dax"" to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""walm"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""blue""), followed by ""yellow,"" which does not directly correlate with any input word. Since ""dax"" appears once, it corresponds to the first ""green.""

- Input: ""dax walm"" includes ""dax"" and ""walm"" and corresponds to an output of three ""green."" Here, both ""dax"" and ""walm"" produce ""green,"" but without further examples, it is hard to determine if ""walm"" has a consistent output or if the repetition of ""green"" is specifically linked to these words appearing together.

- The single instances of ""dax"" in an input consistently produce a single ""green"" output.

Considering all this, the only consistent rule that can be induced from the given information is:

dax -> meaning. Rule: Every occurrence of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.",1.0,135,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" correlates to the color ""green"", regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. 

Therefore, the rule is: dax -> green.",1.0,135,dax
"Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" correlates with the output ""green."" Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output at least once. In every example provided, ""dax"" is either followed or preceded by other words, but does not seem to cause a variability in the color output associated with ""dax"" itself. Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"" regardless of its position or the presence of other words in the input.

Rule: dax -> green. ""Dax"" means or represents the color ""green.""",1.0,135,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green"" for each occurrence of ""dax"".",1.0,135,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" I will assess the outputs in relation to the presence of ""dax"" and other words in the inputs.

Here are the given examples:

1. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

3. Input: dax
   Output: green

4. Input: dax
   Output: green

5. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green

In every instance where ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output. This is consistent regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the sequence or the presence of other words. I'll disregard other color associations for now since we are solely focusing on the meaning of ""dax.""

Rule: When ""dax"" is present in the input, the output will always include ""green."" 

The meaning of ""dax"" within this set of examples seems to be directly translated to the color ""green.""

Therefore:

dax -> meaning. Meaning: green",1.0,135,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to analyze the given examples and look for patterns in the outputs that can relate to the word's use. The outputs are color responses to the inputs.

Looking at the first and third examples:
- ""dax bluf wif"" -> ""green green red""
- ""zup wif zup dax"" -> ""yellow red yellow green""

In both cases, ""dax"" precedes ""green"" and ""wif"" precedes ""red"". Therefore, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Analyzing the second example:
- ""wif dax"" -> ""red green""

Here, the pattern holds: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

In the fourth example:
- ""lug dax wif"" -> ""blue green red""

""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" further confirming the pattern.

Finally, in the fifth example:
- ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red""

Here, ""lug"" still corresponds to ""blue""; ""wif"" is consistent with ""red,"" but we also have ""walm,"" which has not occurred in previous examples. Each occurrence of ""walm"" corresponds to ""red."" While this does not directly impact the meaning of ""wif,"" it maintains consistency for ""wif"" being ""red.""

Rule:
wif -> red",1.0,135,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the patterns between the inputs and outputs:

- In the first input ""dax bluf wif,"" the word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red.""
- In the second input ""wif dax,"" ""wif"" is also matched with ""red.""
- In the third input ""zup wif zup dax,"" again ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the fourth input ""lug dax wif,"" ""wif"" once more produces ""red.""
- In the fifth input ""lug wif walm,"" ""wif"" is still corresponding to ""red.""

No matter the position of ""wif"" in the sequence or the words around it, ""wif"" consistently maps to the output ""red."" Based on this pattern, we can deduce the following rule:

wif -> red

Rule: 'wif' consistently corresponds to the output 'red,' regardless of its position or the surrounding words in the input sequence.",1.0,135,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look for patterns in the examples given:

1. dax bluf wif -> green green red
2. wif dax -> red green
3. zup wif zup dax -> yellow red yellow green
4. lug dax wif -> blue green red
5. lug wif walm -> blue red red red

First, let's isolate the instances of ""wif"" and their corresponding outputs:

1. bluf wif -> green red
2. wif dax -> red green
3. zup wif -> yellow red
4. lug dax wif -> green red
5. wif walm -> red red (here, we note that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so we consider the output after ""lug"")

From these examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red."" Therefore, the rule seems straightforward:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red.""

So, wif -> red.",1.0,135,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we will analyze the given examples and the corresponding outputs in order to detect any patterns or rules.

1. Input: dax bluf wif
   Output: green green red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green""
   - Since ""wif"" is followed by ""red,"" it might suggest ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

2. Input: wif dax
   Output: red green
   - Confirming ""wif"" as ""red"" since it comes before ""red"" again.
   - Confirming ""dax"" as ""green.""

3. Input: zup wif zup dax
   Output: yellow red yellow green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" consistent with previous examples.

4. Input: lug dax wif
   Output: blue green red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" as previously established.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" again consistent with the previous examples.

5. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" is a new word in the examples, but looking at the output, it seems that it also corresponds to ""red.""

Using the above analysis, we can deduce the meaning of the word ""wif"" based on the color coded in its corresponding output.

Rule: wif -> red

The underlying rule seems to be that each nonce word translates to a specific color in the output. ""Wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""",1.0,135,wif
"Through the given examples, the word ""wif"" seems to always correspond to the output ""red."" There is no indication from the provided examples that ""wif"" changes meaning based on context or position. Therefore, ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,135,wif
"To identify what the nonce word ""zup"" means, we have to analyze how it changes the output in each of the given examples. Let's look at each occurrence of ""zup"" and see how it gets translated in the output:

1. wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
2. dax bluf zup bluf dax -> green green yellow yellow green
3. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
4. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
5. wif zup -> red yellow

Each time ""zup"" appears in an input, the first color in the output immediately following it is ""yellow."" Additionally, there is no instance where ""zup"" is followed by any color other than ""yellow."" Because the output is a sequence of colors, we can deduce that ""zup"" is consistently translated to the color ""yellow"".

Hence, we can conclude the rule:

zup -> yellow",1.0,135,zup
"zup -> ""yellow""

Rule: Each time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.",1.0,135,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow. Each instance where ""zup"" is used in the input, the word yellow appears in the output, regardless of the position of ""zup"" within the sequence of words. Additionally, none of the other words in the inputs translate to yellow in the corresponding outputs. 

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,135,zup
"From the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". This conclusion is drawn from the consistent representation of the output ""yellow"" every time the word ""zup"" is present in the input, regardless of its position or the words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,135,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in every instance it appears in the provided examples.",1.0,135,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" from the given examples, let's look for patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs. We will compare the position where ""bluf"" occurs in the input and the color that corresponds to it in the output.

1. Input: zup dax **bluf** zup dax
   Output: yellow green **green** yellow green
   
2. Input: zup **bluf** wif dax lug
   Output: yellow **yellow** red green blue
   
3. Input: dax lug wif **bluf**
   Output: green blue red **red**
   
4. Input: wif **bluf**
   Output: red **red**
   
5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif **bluf**
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green **red** **red**

Now, let's analyze:

- In examples 3 and 4, ""bluf"" is at the end, and each time, the last color is ""red.""
- In example 2, ""bluf"" is second in the sequence, and the second color in the output is ""yellow.""
- In example 1, ""bluf"" sits in the third position, and the color is ""green,"" which is the same color repeated in the output.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" follows a series of words with the last being ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red,"" which is a double representation of the color assigned to ""wif.""

From this, it seems that ""bluf"" does not correspond to a single static color. Instead, ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. In other words, it duplicates the output color of the word before it.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the output color of the preceding word.",1.0,135,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red

Based on the given examples, every occurrence of the word ""bluf"" correlates with the output ""red."" 

Therefore, ""bluf"" means ""red.""",1.0,135,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red

Based on the examples given:

- In every example where the word ""bluf"" appears, the corresponding output color is always ""red.""
- Additionally, no other words in the examples always result in the output color ""red.""

Therefore, it can be deduced that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red.""",1.0,135,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the outputs associated with each of its occurrences.

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup dax,"" and the output is ""green yellow green."" Since ""zup dax"" without ""bluf"" at the beginning yields ""yellow green,"" this suggests that ""bluf"" might invoke a repetition of the following color but does not immediately tell us the color associated with ""bluf"" itself.

2. The second example shows ""bluf"" between ""zup"" and ""wif dax lug,"" which corresponds to ""yellow red green blue."" Since we know that ""zup"" is yellow and ""wif dax lug"" results in ""red green blue,"" ""bluf"" appears to cause the repetition of the color associated with ""wif,"" which is red.

3. In the third example, ""bluf"" is at the end and is preceded by ""dax lug wif."" According to the output ""green blue red red,"" and knowing that ""dax lug wif"" corresponds to ""green blue red,"" we can infer that ""bluf"" again causes the repetition of the color associated with ""wif,"" which is red.

4. The fourth example is just ""wif bluf"" with the output ""red red,"" supporting the hypothesis that ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it since we know ""wif"" is red.

5. For the fifth example, ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence ""zup lug zup walm dax wif."" The output for this sequence, without considering ""bluf,"" should be ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red."" Adding ""bluf"" results in an extra ""red,"" thereby again indicating that ""bluf"" is causing the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes just before it which is ""wif,"" red in this case.

Based on these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.",1.0,135,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's inspect the patterns related to its presence in each input and the corresponding output colors:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is associated with ""green."" However, ""dax"" is also associated with ""green."" Therefore, we cannot conclude that ""bluf"" means ""green"" based on this example alone.

2. In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by the output ""red."" This differs from the previous instance, suggesting that ""bluf"" does not relate to a specific color but may depend on context or position.

3. In the third example, ""bluf"" is once again associated with the color ""red.""

4. In the fourth example, consisting of only ""wif bluf,"" we see ""bluf"" output as ""red"" again.

5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" appears at the end and is again associated with ""red.""

From the third, fourth, and fifth examples, we discern a consistent rule — whenever ""bluf"" appears, it is associated with ""red."" However, ""wif"" is also associated with red in various instances. Since ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" in three examples where ""bluf"" is linked to ""red,"" we may infer that ""bluf"" replicates the color associated with the preceding word.

Considering the patterns and the consistent replication of the color of the preceding word when ""bluf"" is in use, we arrive at the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word. If there is no preceding word, the default color is red.",0.9,135,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""walm"". 

For instance:

- In ""lug zup dax walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and the output is ""green green green"".
- In ""lug walm wif lug bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and hence the output for ""walm"" is ""blue blue"".
- In ""dax walm"", we again see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and thus ""walm"" results in ""green green green"".
- In ""lug wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and the output for ""walm"" is ""red red red"".

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the color of the previous word to be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.",1.0,135,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it is possible to deduce the following pattern for the word ""walm"":

- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output color sequence features ""blue"" followed by a repetition of ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output color sequence is a repetition of ""green.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output color sequence is a repetition of ""red.""

However, we can notice that ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""wif"" correlate with ""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""red"" respectively, regardless of if ""walm"" is present or not. ""Walm"" on its own does not have a direct translation to a specific color; instead, it seems to indicate the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word that precedes it. The number of times the color is repeated appears to be three, as evidenced by the examples where ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""wif.""

The inputs and outputs show that ""walm"" multiplies the occurrence of the color related to the preceding word thrice, except when following ""lug"" where the color ""blue"" is repeated once more. This inconsistency could suggest that when preceded by the color ""blue,"" the rule changes to produce two additional ""blue"" outputs (leading to three ""blue"" outputs in total when combined with the standard output of ""lug""), whereas for other colors, it adds two repetitions.

The rule can be summarized as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, it repeats the color associated with the preceding word two extra times, creating a sequence of three repeated colors.

Thus:

walm -> meaning: repeat the color of the preceding word two more times (total of three repetitions).",1.0,135,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to observe the correlation between the input and output in the given examples:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""lug zup dax,"" the output is ""blue yellow green green green."" Noting that ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""dax"" to green, the presence of ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in two additional greens.
   
2. ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" (which is blue), resulting in two additional blues.

3. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green."" This matches the previous pattern, with ""walm"" following ""dax"" (which is green) leading to two additional greens.

4. ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red."" This indicates that ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which is red) and adds two more reds.

5. The final example is the same as the third one, consistent with the earlier pattern.

From these examples, we can deduce the general rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word two more times.

Therefore: 
walm -> When it follows ""lug,"" it results in two more blues; when it follows ""zup,"" it would hypothetically result in two more yellows (though this specific combination is not demonstrated in the given examples); when it follows ""dax,"" it results in two more greens; when it follows ""wif,"" it results in two more reds.",1.0,135,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"" from the given examples, let's look at each example and its corresponding output:

1. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
2. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
4. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

Analyzing the inputs and outputs:

- In examples 1 and 3, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output, but in example 1, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in three instances of ""green"" instead of one. 
- In example 2, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, and again, ""walm"" leads to a repetition, this time of the color ""blue.""
- Example 4 is slightly different. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" but ""wif"" deviates from this pattern and is translated to ""red."" However, following ""wif,"" we have ""walm,"" which then repeats the ""red"" three times.

It seems that ""walm"" causes the color word that comes before it to be repeated three times. This repetition follows whatever the word represented before ""walm"" was introduced.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce for ""walm"" is:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times in the output.",1.0,135,walm
"walm -> repeat the preceding color.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color-designating word, repeat the output color corresponding to the preceding word. For example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" is consistently translated to the color ""green."" Regardless of its position in the sentence or the words it is paired with, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" There is no variation in the output for ""dax,"" which suggests that its meaning is not dependent on the context within these examples.

"Rule: dax -> green

The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the given examples regardless of context, suggesting that ""dax"" means green.",1.0,136,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context within the sequence of words. Therefore, we can establish the following rule:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output.",1.0,136,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".",1.0,136,wif

wif -> red. Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" means ""red"".",1.0,136,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""

Here are the mappings from the examples:
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""dax"" -> ""green""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""walm"" -> ""red red red"" (This seems to be an outlier or a case where ""walm"" specifically translates to three occurrences of ""red"")

Given that ""wif"" outputs ""red"" regardless of its position in the input, we can formulate the rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,136,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a color:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- walm -> red red red (since it only appears once, it's not entirely clear if this mapping is consistent or context-dependent)

In all cases, regardless of position or surrounding words, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,136,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output at the exact position where ""zup"" was placed. 

For further clarity:
- For the input ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to the first ""yellow"" in the sequence and ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow.""
- In the input ""lug walm zup,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" while ""lug"" and ""walm"" both correspond to ""blue.""
- Regardless of what follows or precedes it, ""zup"" always maps to ""yellow"" in the output.

Hence the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,136,zup
"From the provided examples, it seems that ""zup"" correlates with the word ""yellow"".

Here are the examples that lead to this conclusion:

1. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - This suggests ""zup"" could mean ""yellow"", as ""bluf"" also appears to translate to ""yellow"".

2. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax 
   Output: green green yellow yellow green
   - ""Dax"" and ""bluf"" are repeated and correspond to ""green"" and ""yellow"" respectively. ""Zup"" occurs between two ""bluf"" words and corresponds to ""yellow"" which matches the previous example.

3. Input: lug walm zup
   Output: blue blue blue yellow
   - ""Lug"" and ""walm"" both seem to translate to ""blue"", and ""zup"" at the end corresponds to the only ""yellow"" in the output, further supporting that ""zup"" means ""yellow"".

4. Input: zup lug
   Output: yellow blue
   - ""Zup"" here corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

5. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   - ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red"".

Given all of these examples, it's clear that ""zup"" is consistently translated as ""yellow"". Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow",1.0,136,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds with the word ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,136,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,136,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"". Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Other words seem to have their own color associations as well, like ""bluf"" with ""green"", ""lug"" with ""blue"", and ""wif"" with ""red"".

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,136,zup
"Analyzing the provided input-output pairs, we can attempt to deduce the rule by which ""bluf"" is assigned a color in the outputs. Here is the analysis of each example:

- Input: wif bluf dax walm | Output: red red green green green
    ""wif"" leads to ""red"", ""dax"" and ""walm"" each lead to ""green"".

- Input: dax wif bluf | Output: green red red 
    ""dax"" leads to ""green"", ""wif"" leads to ""red"".

- Input: wif bluf dax | Output: red red green 
    The color sequence is the same as the previous example, with ""wif"" leading to ""red"", ""dax"" leading to ""green"".

- Input: zup dax bluf zup dax | Output: yellow green green yellow green
    Here, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" once again leads to ""green"".

- Input: dax zup bluf | Output: green yellow yellow
    As before, ""dax"" leads to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

From the observations above, we can see that ""bluf"" is not consistently leading to the same color output. However, it seems to follow a pattern where ""bluf"" takes the color of the word preceding it:

- In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and both are red.
- In the second and third examples, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and both are red.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", and both result in green; the same pattern is repeated for ""zup"" and yellow.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", and both result in yellow.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. If ""wif"" is red and comes before ""bluf"", ""bluf"" is red. If ""dax"" is green and comes before ""bluf"", ""bluf"" is green. If ""zup"" is yellow and comes before ""bluf"", ""bluf"" is yellow. Thus:

bluf -> meaning: Bluf takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,136,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, each word appears to correspond to a color in the output.

- ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red""
- ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green""
- ""bluf"" seems to vary in its output
- ""zup"" seems to consistently map to ""yellow""

However, we notice a pattern with ""bluf"" – whenever it is preceded by ""dax"", it results in ""green"", and when preceded by ""zup"", it results in ""yellow"". Moreover, when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", its output is ""red"". This suggests that the color ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word.

Therefore, the rule is:
Rule: bluf -> The color of the word that precedes it.",1.0,136,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule behind the word ""bluf,"" we need to look at the correspondence between the input and output sequences, specifically focusing on the occurrences of ""bluf"" and their resultant colors.

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
Output: yellow green green yellow green

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Analyzing the outputs, we observe that ""bluf"" results in the following colors:

1. After ""wif"" -> ""bluf"" outputs red.
2. Following ""wif"" and before ""dax"" -> ""bluf"" outputs red.
3. After ""dax"" and before ""zup"" -> ""bluf"" outputs green.
4. After ""zup"" -> ""bluf"" outputs yellow.

From these observations, we can understand that the color output of ""bluf"" is directly influenced by the word that precedes it:

- ""wif"" before ""bluf"" results in red.
- ""dax"" before ""bluf"" results in green.
- ""zup"" before ""bluf"" results in yellow.

The corresponding outputs suggest that ""bluf"" means to take on the color based on the preceding word according to a set mapping.

Rule: bluf -> the color output is determined by the preceding word according to a specific mapping: wif leads to red, dax leads to green, and zup leads to yellow.",1.0,136,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" based on the given examples, let's first observe the patterns in the inputs and corresponding outputs.

In every output, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Additionally, there are other words whose colors we can determine:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" as well.
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

Every time ""bluf"" appears, regardless of its position in the input list, it always results in ""green"" in the output. This consistency suggests that ""bluf"" directly translates to the color ""green"".

bluf -> green. Rule: ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,136,bluf
"The rule associated with the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be related to the sequence of the words and their associated colors.

Let's look at the examples:

- In the first example, when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""dax"" the output is two reds followed by a green. Since ""wif"" leads to a red and ""dax"" leads to a green, ""bluf"" may signify a repetition of the preceding color (""wif"" -> red), leading to ""red red.""

- In the second example, when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is still red red, indicating that again ""bluf"" could mean ""repeat the previous color.""

- In the third example, ""bluf"" is between two ""wifs,"" and it still outputs red for ""bluf."" This reinforces the idea that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the word before it.

- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" which corresponds to a green, and the output for ""bluf"" is green, not yellow. This once again suggests that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word.

- The final example shows ""bluf"" after ""zup"" (which is yellow) and the output is yellow, which maintains the consistency of the rule.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.

Rule: If ""bluf"" is present in a sequence, the color associated with ""bluf"" in the output is the same as the color associated with the word immediately before it.",0.9,136,bluf
"walm -> tripling of the color that comes before it.

Rule: Whenever ""walm"" appears after a color, the output is that color repeated three times. If ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue"" three times; if it follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" three times; if it follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" three times; if it follows ""bluf,"" the output is ""green"" three times.",1.0,136,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce that the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color word that precedes it three times. 

Let's break down the examples to understand this rule:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" is translated as ""blue”, and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated three times.

2. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - ""lug"" is translated as ""blue"", ""wif"" as ""red"", and ""walm"" causes the most recent color (red, from ""wif"") to repeat three times.

3. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times. Then ""zup"" is introduced as ""yellow"", and the following ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times.

4. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red green green green
   - ""wif"" is ""red"", ""bluf"", which has not been previously defined, could be assumed to be ""green"" by its positioning and corresponding output, ""dax"" does not seem to affect the output here, and ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times.

5. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat three times, and ""wif"" is the last word to translate as ""red"".

If we were to translate ""walm"" into English, it would mean ""repeat the last color mentioned three times"". Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the most recently mentioned color word three times.",1.0,136,walm
"walm -> repeats the color output of the preceding word.

Rule: When you encounter ""walm"" in the input, repeat the color associated with the previous word in the output the same number of times as the previous word’s output. For example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and the presence of ""walm"" after ""lug"" means that the output color of ""lug"" (blue) is repeated three times. Similarly, if ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which outputs ""red"" once, the repetition induced by ""walm"" results in ""red red red"" because the output color of ""wif"" (red) is repeated thrice.",1.0,136,walm
"Analyzing the patterns provided, it can be observed that the output consists of colors being repeated multiple times. It seems that each nonce word, including ""walm,"" translates to a specific color and that the repetition count depends on something within the input. To determine the rule for ""walm,"" a closer look at the instances where the word is used will be helpful.

- In the first example ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" and ""walm"" both translate to ""blue,"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""lug wif walm,"" we get ""blue red red red,"" where ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" again produces a color that is repeated multiple times. Given that three words were provided but four colors are in the output, it appears that ""walm"" is directly related to the number of repetitions of the color that follows it.
- In the third example ""wif walm zup walm,"" the output is ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" while ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" Again, ""walm"" leads to repeated instances of the color that comes after it.
- The fourth example ""wif bluf dax walm,"" which outputs ""red red green green green,"" further supports the idea that ""walm"" is related to the repetition, rather than a direct color translation because ""bluf"" is ""red"" and ""dax"" is translated to ""green.""
- The fifth example ""zup walm wif"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow red."" Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and again, ""walm"" repeats the color.

Taking these observations into account, we can induce that ""walm"" means the following:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color of the word immediately following it to be repeated three times.

So, the rule is:

walm -> Causes the next color word to be repeated three times.",0.9,136,walm
"Based on the provided examples, ""walm"" seems to trigger the repetition of the color word that precedes it. The number of times the color word is repeated corresponds to the number of letters in the color word itself. Here's the breakdown by example:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" (the word ""blue"" has four letters and is repeated three times, which suggests that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"").
- ""lug wif walm"" yields ""blue red red red"" (suggesting that ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" which has three letters and is repeated three times).
- ""wif walm zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow"" (indicating that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" which has six letters and is repeated three times).
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" becomes ""red red green green green"" (implying that ""bluf"" means ""green,"" which has five letters and is repeated three times, and ""dax"" is not followed by ""walm,"" so it does not trigger repetition and is omitted in the output).
- ""zup walm wif,"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow red"" (indicating that the color immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times, and ""wif"" translates to ""red"" as previously identified).

"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following relationships between the nonce words and colors:

- dax -> green

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> when following dax, it turns into ""green green green""
- bluf -> there's insufficient data to determine its exact meaning, but based on the pattern, it could be inferred that it outputs one color repeated as many times as its position in the sequence (in the last example, bluf is the third word, so it results in yellow repeated three times)

For the word 'dax', it seems to consistently translate to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence or the context it is used in. Thus, we can give the following rule:

- ""wif"" consistently maps to the color red.
- ""lug"" consistently maps to the color blue.
- ""zup"" consistently maps to the color yellow.

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,137,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by looking at the patterns of the colors associated with known words and how they change when ""bluf"" is introduced.

From the first and fifth examples:
- dax wif bluf -> green red red
- lug wif bluf -> blue red red

We can see that regardless of the word before ""wif,"" when ""bluf"" is added after it, the output color associated with ""bluf"" is ""red.""

To further confirm, we can compare more examples where ""bluf"" is present:
- zup bluf wif lug dax -> yellow yellow red blue green
- dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
- lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue

In these cases, every time ""bluf"" occurs, the color ""red"" is always in the output, and ""bluf"" never directly precedes or follows another instance of ""bluf.""

"Rule: bluf -> red

- In every instance of ""walm"" in the input, the corresponding output is a sequence of three consecutive ""red.""
- The word ""walm"" does not seem to have any relation or dependency on the words that come before or after it in the input sequence.
- The effect of the word ""walm"" is consistent across all examples; it always translates to ""red red red"" in the output.

Considering this, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> three consecutive ""red"" in the output sequence.",1.0,137,walm
"Based on the provided examples, walm appears to repeat the color associated with the preceding word for the subsequent words until a new color word is encountered. To confirm this, let's examine the occurrences of ""walm"":

1. In the first example, ""zup"" is translated as ""yellow,"" and after ""walm"" is used, there are three instances of ""red,"" even though different words follow. The word ""wif"" should translate to ""red.""

   Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   
2. In the second example, both ""wif"" and ""walm"" lead to ""red red red,"" and then a new word ""dax"" changes the color to green.

   Input: wif walm dax

3. In the third example, ""dax"" translates to green, followed by a different word ""lug,"" which translates to blue. After ""walm"" is used, the words repeat the color blue until the next ""dax"" occurs, subsequently repeating the color green.

   Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax

4. In the fourth example, ""zup"" again leads to yellow, followed by ""dax"" which translates to green. After ""walm"" is used, the color green is repeated.

   Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green
   
5. In the fifth example, ""zup"" translates to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, ""zup"" to yellow again, followed by ""walm,"" which causes the yellow to repeat until ""dax"" introduces green, followed by ""wif"" for red, and ""bluf"" introduces red as well.

Considering the pattern, every time the word ""walm"" appears in the input, the word immediately following ""walm"" gets repeated in the color output before the sequence continues with the next color translation. For example, in the first input, ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and, with the introduction of ""walm,"" the next colors are ""red red."" We can follow this same pattern for the other examples provided.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the next word's color output to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> the color of the following word is repeated three times.",1.0,137,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" changes the color mentioned before it to yellow, and retains this effect until a new color word is introduced. Here's the analysis:

- In the first input, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm"" is mentioned, ""red"" is repeated three times.
- In the second input, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" again causes the repetition of red until ""dax"" introduces green.
- The third and fourth inputs show a similar pattern where ""walm"" induces repetition of the last mentioned color until a new color phrase appears.
- The fifth input demonstrates that ""walm"" continues to turn the colors into repeats of yellow until a new color word is used.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color directly preceding it to repeat until a different color is introduced.",0.9,137,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to change the color that follows it to red multiple times. However, let's observe each sequence:

1. After ""walm"" the color red appears three times. However, before ""walm"" the word is ""wif"" which we can observe corresponds to red as well in another example. So, one possibility is that ""walm"" causes the next color to repeat.

2. ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green"". This supports the repetition theory as ""red"" follows ""wif"" and is then repeated after ""walm.""

3. ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" becomes ""green blue blue blue green red red green"". Here, ""blue"" is repeated three times after ""walm"", while both ""dax"" and ""wif"" are terms that come after ""walm"" in other examples translating to ""green"" and ""red"" respectively.

4. In ""zup dax walm"", ""green"" is repeated three times after ""walm"", while before it we have ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"".

5. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" turns into ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red"". Here, ""yellow"" is repeated four times after ""walm""; thus, the sequence further supports the rule that ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color term that comes after it.

Based on the evidence, we can infer:

walm -> meaning: Causes the next color word to be repeated multiple times. Rule: If a color word follows ""walm"", it is repeated three times if ""walm"" is not at the end of the sequence, or until the end of the sequence if ""walm"" is near the end.",0.8,137,walm

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""lug"" consistently correlates with the color ""blue.""

Hence the rule appears to be quite straightforward.

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" I will look at the position of ""dax"" in the input strings and the corresponding output colors, considering position and surrounding words.

1. In the first input/output pair (""dax lug dax lug wif"" -> ""green blue green blue red""), ""dax"" corresponds to green. Since ""lug"" follows ""dax"" each time and corresponds to blue, it suggests ""dax"" indicates green regardless of what follows.

2. In the second input/output pair (""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red""), ""dax"" again corresponds to green, even though the words ""wif"" and ""walm"" follow, suggesting other words have no effect on ""dax"" representing green.

3. The third pair (""dax zup wif zup"" -> ""green yellow red yellow"") reinforces that ""dax"" is green, despite the presence of other colors that come from the words ""zup"" and ""wif.""

4. Input four (""zup lug dax lug"" -> ""yellow blue green blue"") shows ""dax"" in the middle this time but still corresponds to green.

5. The fifth pair (""dax walm zup lug dax"" -> ""green green green yellow blue green"") shows ""dax"" at the beginning and end, both times corresponding to green.

From these examples, we can deduce that ""dax"" indicates the color green, irrespective of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words. 

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,138,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the provided examples and the corresponding outputs.

1. dax lug dax lug wif -> green blue green blue red
2. dax wif walm -> green red red red
3. dax zup wif zup -> green yellow red yellow
4. zup lug dax lug -> yellow blue green blue
5. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green

From these examples, we can identify a pattern with 'dax' always translating to 'green' regardless of its position or the surrounding words in the input. Therefore, we have a straightforward rule for 'dax':

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,138,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at each instance it appears and the color that corresponds to it in the output:

1. Every time ""dax"" appears, the word ""green"" corresponds to it in the output.
2. ""dax"" precedes different words each time; therefore, the meaning of ""dax"" is not context-dependent on the following word.
3. ""dax"" does not change meaning when it appears multiple times in an input.

Given these observations, we can suggest the following rule:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

So, dax -> green.",1.0,138,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look for patterns in each provided input-output pair. We'll look at the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence and the corresponding parts in the output sequence to figure out what it means.

Looking at the outputs, we observe that every time ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output:

1. dax lug dax lug wif → green blue green blue red
2. dax wif walm → green red red red
3. dax zup wif zup → green yellow red yellow
4. zup lug dax lug → yellow blue green blue
5. dax walm zup lug dax → green green green yellow blue green

Based on these examples, the rule we can induce is:

Rule: dax translates to the color ""green"" in the output irrespective of its position in the input sequence or the context.

Therefore:

dax -> green",1.0,138,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Based on the provided examples, every time the word ""dax"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output sequence. This consistency across all examples indicates that ""dax"" means ""green"".",1.0,138,dax
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,138,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it's possible to induce a rule for the meaning of the word ""wif."" Let's analyze the given input and output to understand how ""wif"" is used:

1. lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
   blue red red green blue blue

2. lug walm zup lug zup wif
   blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

3. lug wif zup wif
   blue red yellow red

4. dax lug zup wif bluf dax
   green blue yellow red red green

5. wif bluf lug
   red red blue

Looking at these examples, ""wif"" always translates to ""red."" No matter the context or position in the sequence, ""wif"" consistently corresponds with the color red.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,138,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,138,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs to find a pattern:

1. ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" -> ""blue red red green blue blue""
2. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red""
3. ""lug wif zup wif"" -> ""blue red yellow red""
4. ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue yellow red red green""
5. ""wif bluf lug"" -> ""red red blue""

Looking at where ""wif"" appears and the corresponding output:

- In example 1, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and results in ""red"" before ""red.""
- In example 2, ""wif"" is at the end after ""zup,"" resulting in ""red.""
- In example 3, ""wif"" follows ""lug"" and also precedes ""zup,"" both instances leading to ""red.""
- In example 4, ""wif"" follows ""zup"" and the result is ""red.""
- In example 5, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" resulting in ""red.""

In all cases, the presence of ""wif"" results in the output ""red,"" regardless of its position concerning other words. Thus, we induce the following rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

4. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green
   In this example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow""), and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""yellow."" Afterward, ""dax"" stands alone and is translated to ""green.""

5. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (which is translated to ""red""), and accordingly, ""bluf"" is also ""red."" Then ""dax"" is ""green,"" and although ""walm"" hasn't been explained directly, it looks like its rule might be to repeat the color of the word preceding it twice, but this rule for ""walm"" is not the focus here.

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,138,bluf
"bluf -> repeating the previous color's name. Rule: When the word 'bluf' appears in the input, it causes the output to repeat the color name of the word preceding 'bluf'.

If 'bluf' is the first word, since there is no preceding color, it would not apply.",1.0,138,bluf
"Given the examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" mirrors the color of the word that immediately precedes it. If there is no preceding word, there is no color to mirror, which seems impossible given the examples since ""bluf"" is always preceded by something.

For instance:

- In the first example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and corresponds to yellow, so ""bluf"" also corresponds to yellow.
- In the second example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" also corresponds to green.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is red, so the first ""bluf"" is red. Next, ""bluf"" follows itself, continuing the color red, while ""dax"" is green and ""walm"" continues the green pattern. 

Here's the rule:

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color of the word immediately before it. If there are successive ""bluf"" instances, it continues the color of the first ""bluf""'s preceding word until a new word with a different color appears.",1.0,138,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a repetition of the color that is produced by the word immediately preceding ""walm"". Here is the reasoning:

1. In the first example ""dax lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"". So, here ""walm"" repeats the color blue three times.
   
2. In the second example ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, ""dax"" to green, ""wif"" to red, and ""bluf"" to red red. ""Zup walm"" here leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"", illustrating that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"", which is yellow, three times.

3. Both the third and fourth examples ""zup walm"" again result in ""yellow yellow yellow"", reinforcing the rule that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

4. However, in the fifth example ""zup wif walm"", we have a slight change: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" to red, and ""walm"" here leads to ""red red red"", showing that ""walm"" has taken the latest color ""red"" from ""wif"" and repeated it three times.

Given these examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

"Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it until the end of the sequence.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the colour word that immediately precedes it. Specifically, ""walm"" repeats the last mentioned colour word three times.

- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" produces ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red,"" meaning ""walm"" repeats the colour word for ""zup"" (""yellow"") three times.

- ""zup walm"" is consistently translated as ""yellow yellow yellow,"" reinforcing the observation that ""walm"" repeats the preceding colour word, which in this case is ""yellow.""

- ""zup wif walm"" produces ""yellow red red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the colour word for ""wif"" (""red"") three times.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" influences the output by repeating the color that corresponds to the word that immediately precedes it. Each example where ""walm"" is used results in a repetition of the preceding color.

For example, in ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is multiple instances of yellow (""yellow yellow yellow""). Similarly, when ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which corresponds to the color blue), the output is multiple instances of blue. The number of repetitions ranges from two to three times in the given examples.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

- In the second example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" prior to ""walm,"" the last color mentioned is ""yellow,"" which is repeated five times since ""yellow"" has six letters.

- In the third and fourth examples, ""zup walm"" only repeats the color ""yellow"" three times because there is no other color and ""yellow"" is the last color mentioned.

- In the fifth example, ""zup wif walm,"" the last color mentioned before ""walm"" is ""red,"" which is a three-letter word. Consequently, ""red"" is repeated three times.",0.8,138,walm

"Based on the given examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. Whenever the word 'dax' appears, the output is 'green'.
2. The word 'walm' consistently leads to three 'green' outputs in a row, suggesting it might mean 'three greens'.
3. The word 'zup' seems to correspond with the output 'yellow'.
4. The word 'bluf' appears to relate to double 'red' in the output.

Considering these patterns, we can induce the following rules:

- 'dax' results in a single 'green' output.
- 'walm' results in three 'green' outputs in a row.
- 'zup' corresponds to a single 'yellow' output.
- 'bluf' corresponds to two 'red' outputs in a row.

Therefore:

"dax -> green. Rule: Each instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.",1.0,139,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" has a specific translation in the outputs:

- When ""dax"" is provided as the sole input, the output is ""green,"" which seems to imply that ""dax"" translates directly to ""green.""
- However, when ""dax"" is included in a sequence with other nonce words, the output is ""green"" followed by additional colors that do not correspond directly to the other input words.
- It seems that the number of times ""green"" appears in the output might be influenced by the number of words that follow ""dax.""

To further elucidate the pattern, look at the differences between sequences including ""dax"":

- In ""dax walm zup walm,"" ""dax"" is followed by three words, resulting in ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" This suggests ""walm"" translates to ""green"" when it follows ""dax.""
- In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" is followed by one word, and the output is ""green green green,"" indicating the same rule might apply.
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" might be represented by ""green"" following ""dax.""
- Each additional word after ""dax"" might result in more than one ""green"" in the output. With every word following ""dax,"" there seems to be a multiplication effect in the output colors, specifically the repetition of ""green.""

Let's infer a potential rule:

Whenever ""dax"" precedes a word, the output will start with ""green,"" and the following word will multiply the occurrence of ""green"" by the number of times that word appears in the input after ""dax."" If ""dax"" is by itself, it simply translates to ""green.""

Yet, the words ""zup"" and ""wif"" do not seem to follow this pattern based on the second example, so further examples would be needed to fully understand the complete rule set.

Let's examine the occurrences:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" appears between ""dax"" (green) and ""wif"" (red), and the output is ""green red."" However, the ""red"" here seems to correspond to the second ""wif,"" not ""bluf."" So ""bluf"" in this case corresponds to ""blue.""

3. In the third example ""bluf"" is between ""wif"" (red) and ""dax"" (green), and the output is ""red red green."" Here again ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" which is a repetition of ""wif.""

4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green) and the output is ""green."" Yet ""bluf"" appears again after another ""dax,"" and the output is again ""green."" There is a pattern here of ""bluf"" repeating the color of the preceding word, which in this case is ""green"" for ""dax.""

5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is again between ""wif"" (red) and ""dax"" (green), with the output being ""red red green."" Like in the third example, ""bluf"" here translates to the color that preceded it, ""red.""

Based on these observations, we can induce that ""bluf"" does not simply translate to a color like ""blue,"" but rather, it is a placeholder that adopts the color of the word that precedes it. If it follows ""lug"" which translates to blue, it becomes ""blue."" If it follows ""wif"" which translates to red, it becomes ""red."" If it follows ""dax"" which translates to green, it becomes ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,139,bluf

bluf -> blue.",0.0,139,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" indicates repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it, three additional times. Here's the breakdown:

- In ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" After ""walm"" the sequence ""red red red"" appears.
- In ""zup wif walm,"" ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" which is then repeated thrice making ""red red red.""
- In ""lug wif walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and again ""red"" is then repeated three times as ""red red red.""
- In ""dax walm wif zup,"" ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" which is then repeated three times as ""green green green"" before moving on to the next colors.
- In ""lug walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" which is then repeated three times as ""blue blue blue.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

"Based on the given examples, we can infer the following:

- ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red""
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue""
- ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red""
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green""

We can note that in each case, ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of the color that precedes it. More precisely, it seems to result in the previous color word being outputted three times. Let's verify that with the other examples:

- ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"". ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" and it results in ""red"" being repeated three times.
- ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red"". Again, ""wif"" leads to ""red"" and ""walm"" causes this ""red"" to be repeated two more times.

From these observations, we can induce the following rule:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color word that comes immediately before ""walm"" three times.

Rule: bluf -> yellow.",1.0,140,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" is directly associated with repeating the color linked to the previous word. In each example, the output associated with ""walm"" consists of a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it.

Similarly, in ""dax walm wif zup,"" ""dax"" is associated with the color green, and following ""walm,"" there is a repetition of ""green"" until the next word changes the pattern.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" would be:

"Based on the outputs corresponding to each input that included the nonce word ""walm,"" it appears that the output for ""walm"" involves repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times.

- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and directly before ""walm"" there is ""wif,"" so ""walm"" outputs ""red red red.""
- In all other examples provided, the color repeated three times is the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule is:

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" translates to tripling the color that the word immediately preceding it represents. If we analyze each example and see how ""walm"" behaves according to the color assigned to the word just before it, we can deduce this pattern.

Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" Thus, ""walm"" turns ""zup"" (yellow) into three yellows.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" again, resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and is followed by ""dax,"" which results in ""green,"" so the rule still holds.
- In the third example, when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output becomes ""red red red,"" tripling the color for ""wif.""
- The fourth example is consistent with the rule, as ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" yielding ""green green green.""

"Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to correspond to repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times.

- In ""dax walm wif zup,"" ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" so ""walm"" results in ""green green green.""
- ""lug walm zup"" leads to ""blue blue blue yellow"" because ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" followed by three repeats due to ""walm"" and then ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

- When 'dax' is preceded and followed by 'lug', the word 'dax' corresponds to 'green' in both instances.
- When 'dax' is preceded by 'lug' with no word following 'dax', it still corresponds to 'green'.
- When 'dax' is followed by 'walm', 'dax' corresponds to 'green' and 'walm' seems to repeat the color of 'dax', resulting in 'green green green'.

Rule: Since ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""walm"" produces two ""green"" outputs, it is possible that ""walm"" might mean ""repeat the last color"" or simply ""green"" in itself. 

However, for ""walm"" to mean ""repeat the last color,"" we would need examples where ""walm"" follows a different color to confirm if it changes its output accordingly. Since we do not have that information, the safest conclusion with the given examples is that both ""dax"" and ""walm"" can mean ""green.""

3. ""lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue green green""

Observations:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""wif,"" outputting ""yellow"" after ""yellow"" and ""red"" after ""red."" This suggests that ""bluf"" could mirror the color of the preceding word.
- In example 2, ""bluf"" again mirrors the color of the preceding word ""lug,"" which outputs ""blue.""
- Example 3 reinforces the idea as ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" and both output ""green.""
- Example 4 is particularly telling because ""bluf"" comes immediately after ""lug,"" and both output ""blue."" It also comes before ""dax"" and ""lug,"" but the output corresponding to ""bluf"" is still ""blue,"" consistent with its immediate predecessor.
- Example 5 shows that ""bluf"" after ""zup"" results in another ""yellow,"" again mimicking the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf mirrors the color output of the word immediately preceding it.

Therefore: bluf -> the same color as the color output of the immediately preceding word.",1.0,141,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we will look at the pattern of words in the input and their corresponding colors in the output.

Let's start by comparing the inputs and outputs that contain the word ""bluf"":

1. ""zup bluf wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow red red""
2. ""lug wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue red blue blue""
3. ""lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue green green""
4. ""lug bluf dax lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue""
5. ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" -> ""green red green yellow yellow""

By examining these examples, it's noticeable that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to different colors in each case. Therefore, ""bluf"" does not correspond to a single color but rather follows a pattern based on context:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" and ""wif,"" and it corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""red,"" which are the colors associated with those words when they appear earlier in the sequence.
- In the second example, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" which is the same color associated with ""lug.""
- The third example confirms this, as ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and both correspond to ""green.""
- The fourth case also supports this rule, as ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" when following ""lug.""
- In the last example, ""bluf"" again corresponds to the color that is associated with the word that appeared just before it, which is ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

The inferred rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word in the sequence.",1.0,141,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following rule for the translation of the word ""bluf"":

- Whenever ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""red.""
- Whenever ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue.""
- Whenever ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" or ""dax"", the output is the same color as the color outputted for the word that precedes it (red for ""wif"", green for ""dax"").

Using these observations, we can deduce a rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the same color as the word immediately preceding it unless it is preceded by ""zup"", in which case it translates to ""red"".",1.0,141,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the patterns between the inputs and the outputs:

Input: zup bluf wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow red red

This tells us that ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""wif"" to red. Because ""bluf"" appears twice and results in two red outputs, it suggests that ""bluf"" does not correspond to red since it follows a ""wif"" which is already red.

Input: lug wif lug bluf
Output: blue red blue blue

Here ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""wif"" to red. Since ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" which is blue, and produces blue, it might suggest that ""bluf"" is copying the previous color.

Input: lug dax bluf
Output: blue green green

In this example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""dax"" to green. ""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in green, which supports the idea that ""bluf"" might copy the previous color.

Input: lug bluf dax lug
Output: blue blue green blue

In this input, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and where ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" it results in blue, but the ""dax"" changes the pattern to green, followed by ""lug"" back to blue. 

Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
Output: green red green yellow yellow

Here we see ""dax"" mapped to green, ""wif"" to red, ""zup"" to yellow. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is yellow, which again fits the idea that ""bluf"" mirrors the preceding color.

Considering these patterns, the rule seems to be:

bluf -> mirrors the color before it

Rule: If the word before ""bluf"" is mapped to a particular color, then ""bluf"" is output as the same color.",1.0,141,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> blue

Evidence:
- In the second example, 'lug wif lug bluf', 'lug' translates to 'blue', and the output ends with 'blue', suggesting 'bluf' also translates to 'blue'.
- The third example, 'lug dax bluf', ends with two 'green' after 'lug' and 'dax', but then it switches back to 'blue' when 'bluf' is introduced.
- In the fourth example, 'lug bluf dax lug', 'lug' is consistently 'blue', and 'bluf' is directly translated as 'blue'.
- The fifth example 'dax wif dax zup bluf' again ends with a 'yellow' after 'zup', and 'bluf' translates to 'yellow', matching the pattern of the first example where 'bluf' follows 'zup' and is translated to 'yellow'. However, considering the consistent translation in other examples where 'bluf' clearly corresponds to 'blue', it's likely that 'yellow' is the anomaly explained by some other unstated rule related to the sequence 'zup bluf' specifically.

This consistency across examples for 'bluf' indicates it means 'blue'.",0.8,141,bluf
"From the given examples, we can notice the following patterns:

1. ""zup walm"" produces three repetitions of ""yellow."" This suggests that ""zup walm"" specifically means three yellows.
2. ""zup walm wif"" produces three yellows followed by a red. We know from the first example that ""zup walm"" yields three yellows, so the addition of ""wif"" results in a red.
3. ""wif walm dax zup"" produces three reds followed by a green and a yellow. We can infer that ""wif"" might be linked to red since it precedes the three reds. ""dax"" might be related to green, as it precedes the green. Lastly, ""zup"" is associated with yellow, consistent with previous examples.
4. ""wif walm zup"" produces three reds followed by a yellow. Again, we can confirm that ""wif"" is likely linked to red and ""zup"" to yellow.
5. ""lug walm"" results in three blues. This example confirms that ""lug"" correlates to blue.

Without any direct statement of what ""walm"" means, it appears that ""walm"" might signal the repetition of the color associated with the word placed directly before it. Therefore, ""walm"" indicates that the color produced by the preceding word should be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",0.9,141,walm
"The rule seems to be that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word the same number of times as there are letters in the preceding word. The nonce word ""walm"" doesn't have a meaning on its own but operates within the context of this rule.

Here is the breakdown of the examples given:

- ""zup walm"": ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow, which has six letters, so the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- ""zup walm wif"": Following the same rule as above, ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow"" three times, followed by ""wif,"" which is associated with red.
- ""wif walm dax zup"": ""wif"" associates with red, which comes out three times due to ""walm""; ""dax"" is not followed by ""walm,"" but if we extend the logic, it might associate with green.
- ""wif walm zup"": ""wif"" once again gives us three reds, followed by ""zup walm,"" which adds a yellow.
- ""lug walm"": ""lug"" is associated with blue, which has three letters, so the output is ""blue"" three times.

Based on the provided examples, the rule is:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated as many times as there are letters in that word.",0.8,141,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to be associated with a repeated color output that corresponds to the first word in the input string. Here's the breakdown:

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""zup walm wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow red""
- ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow""
- ""wif walm zup"" results in ""red red red yellow""
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""

In each case, the first word seems to determine the color that is then repeated three times. Adding ""wif"" after ""walm"" changes the sequence by adding ""red"", which suggests ""wif"" might correspond to ""red"".

Rule: ""walm"" triggers a repetition of a color determined by the preceding word, repeated three times.

walm -> repetition of the color corresponding to the previous word, three times.",0.8,141,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it three times. 

- In the first example (""zup walm""), ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, which is then repeated three times after ""walm"".
- In the second example (""wif walm dax zup""), ""wif"" corresponds to red, which is repeated three times after ""walm"" and before ""dax"" and ""zup"" corresponding to red and yellow, respectively.
- In the fifth example (""lug walm""), ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and the output is blue repeated three times after ""walm"".

Therefore: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word three times.",0.8,141,walm
"Based on the provided examples:

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""zup walm wif"" adds a ""red"" at the end.
- ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow""; with the ""walm"" part correlating with the ""red red red"" part of the output.
- ""wif walm zup"" has ""walm"" corresponding to ""red red red"" once again.
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".

Each time the word ""walm"" appears in the input, a three-word repetition of a color occurs in the output. The actual color used seems to be determined by the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Therefore, it seems that ""walm"" denotes a rule whereby it is replaced with three instances of the color corresponding to the word right before it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color related to the previous word three times.",0.8,141,walm
"lug -> blue.

"Based on the given examples, we can infer the following correlations between the nonce word 'dax' and the output colors:

- Whenever 'dax' is mentioned, the output is 'green'.
- The 'dax' term does not seem to depend on its position within the sequence to determine its corresponding output (it always translates to 'green' regardless of its position).

Given this information, the rule I can deduce for the meaning of 'dax' in this context is:

Rule: 'dax' -> green.",1.0,142,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. This conclusion is drawn from the consistent output that whenever the input contains ""dax,"" the corresponding output is ""green."" 

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,142,dax
"Based on the provided examples, I will analyze the input and its corresponding output to deduce the meaning of ""dax.""

1. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif

4. Input: lug dax zup dax wif

5. Input: dax wif

Considering the examples above, we can note the following:

- In every instance where the word ""dax"" is present, the output is ""green.""
- ""Dax"" does not depend on its position in the sequence or on preceding or following words for it to translate to ""green.""
- The word ""dax"" consistently results in ""green"" regardless of the context of the other words.

Therefore, the rule is straightforward and does not seem to be affected by other possible factors:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,142,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Explanation: In all given examples, every instance of ""dax"" correlates with the word ""green"" in the output. There seems to be a one-to-one relationship with the nonce word ""dax"" and the color ""green,"" irrespective of the context or position within the input sequence.",1.0,142,dax
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,142,wif

- Every instance where ""wif"" is used, the output is ""red"". There is a direct and consistent mapping between the input ""wif"" and the output ""red"", regardless of the context in which ""wif"" appears.

Therefore, we can infer the following:

zup -> yellow. Rule: The word zup translates to the color yellow regardless of its position in the sequence.,1.0,142,zup
"zup -> meaning. Rule:

By examining the examples provided, we can try to determine the meaning or rule associated with the word ""zup"".

- Whenever the word ""zup"" appears alone, the output is ""yellow"".
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""dax"", the output for ""zup"" remains ""yellow"" and an additional ""green"" is included for ""dax"".
- In the context of ""lug walm zup lug walm"", the output ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"" suggests that ""zup"" retains its meaning of ""yellow"" amidst a pattern of ""blue"" outputs (possibly associated with ""lug"" and ""walm"").
- With the input ""zup dax walm"", since ""zup"" is followed by ""dax"", it outputs ""yellow green"" consistent with the second example. The additional ""green green"" can be inferred to result from the word ""walm"".

From these observations, we can infer that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the output ""yellow"" regardless of the context. Therefore:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,142,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Regardless of the context it's used in, whenever ""zup"" appears, the output includes the color ""yellow.""",1.0,142,zup

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"", as evidenced by the consistent output when ""zup"" is present in the input.",1.0,142,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: In the given examples, ""zup"" consistently translates to the color yellow, regardless of the context in which it is used.",1.0,142,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can identify a pattern in which the word ""bluf"" is used. Each example shows that the output for ""bluf"" is repeated twice back-to-back with the same color that corresponds to the word just before ""bluf"".

Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   - ""dax"" correlates with ""green"", ""bluf"" follows with ""green green"".

2. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"", ""bluf"" follows with ""yellow yellow"".

3. Input: dax lug wif bluf
   Output: green blue red red
   - ""wif"" correlates with ""red"", ""bluf"" follows with ""red red"".

4. Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup
   Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow
   - First ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"", ""bluf"" follows with ""blue blue"".
   - The second ""lug"" again is ""blue"", followed by another ""bluf"" which results in ""blue blue"".
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"", and here ""bluf"" is not following ""zup"" directly so the rule does not apply to ""zup"".

So the rule for the word ""bluf"" seems to be: Repeat the color of the preceding word twice.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word twice.",1.0,142,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word. 

Based on the given examples, whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, the output is a repetition of the color word that comes immediately before it.

- In the first and second examples, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green,"" meaning that ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax,"" which is green.
- In the third example, ""wif lug zup bluf"" results in ""red blue yellow yellow,"" hence ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""dax lug wif bluf"" results in ""green blue red red,"" with ""bluf"" repeating the color of ""wif,"" which is red.
- In the fifth example, ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"" results in ""blue blue red blue blue yellow."" Here ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" which is blue, both times it appears. 

Therefore:
bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.",1.0,142,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the word just before it.,1.0,142,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before bluf.,1.0,142,bluf
"bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word. Rule: If a word is followed by ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is the same color as the output for the preceding word.",1.0,142,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to trigger the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it, three times. Each word seems to correspond to a specific color: ""lug"" to blue, ""dax"" to green, ""wif"" to red, and ""zup"" to yellow. When ""walm"" appears after any of these words, the output is the corresponding color repeated three times. If any word follows ""walm,"" the output changes to the color associated with that new word.

Therefore:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" triggers the repetition.
- ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red"" because ""dax"" corresponds to green (repeated three times due to ""walm"") followed by the new word ""wif,"" which corresponds to red.
- ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red"" as the repetition effect of ""walm"" is applied to ""wif,"" which is red.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.",1.0,142,walm
"walm -> the subsequent color is repeated three times.

Rule: When walm is used in a sequence, the color that would normally follow is instead repeated three times before continuing with the remainder of the sequence based on the other words. For example, if ""lug walm"" is the input, the output ""blue blue blue"" represents the word ""lug"" which translates to ""blue,"" and instead of moving on to the next color, ""blue"" is repeated three times due to the presence of ""walm.""",1.0,142,walm
"Observing the patterns in the examples provided, we can determine the following correlations:

1. Every time ""walm"" is used, it is followed by three repetitions of a color in the output. This suggests that ""walm"" is linked to the repetition of color associated with the preceding word.
2. ""lug"" consistently correlates with ""blue.""
3. ""dax"" consistently correlates with ""green.""
4. ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""
5. ""bluf"" correlates with ""red"" when following ""wif"" or ""walm.""
6. ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""

From the above observations, we can formulate the following rule:

- ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color that is associated with the word immediately preceding it, three times.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" is:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

Rule: If a word is followed by ""walm,"" repeat its corresponding color thrice.",1.0,142,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" is associated with a sequence of three identical color outputs. Each input example has the word ""walm"" followed by a sequence of the same color mentioned three times before shifting to a sequence determined by the other words provided. Here is how ""walm"" corresponds to the color outputs for each input:

- In ""lug walm dax wif lug wif,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" So ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""lug walm,"" we again see ""lug"" leading to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""dax walm wif bluf,"" ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and so ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green.""
- In ""lug wif walm,"" ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and then ""walm"" gives us ""red red red.""
- Lastly, in ""zup walm lug wif bluf,"" ""zup"" hasn't been defined specifically, but it is followed by ""walm,"" which again gives us a triplet of the same color, ""yellow,"" before shifting back to the sequence driven by ""lug"" and ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears in the input sequence, it corresponds to the output of three consecutive instances of the color word that precedes it.

Written in the requested format:

walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: ""walm"" means repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times.",1.0,142,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be repeated three times according to the pattern that follows it. It is followed by a color code, with ""lug"" translating to ""blue"", ""dax"" translating to ""green"", ""wif"" translating to ""red"", and an unpaired ""zup"" leading to ""yellow"". Each occurrence of ""walm"" is followed by three consecutive same color codes. Moreover, the color seems to be determined by the word following ""walm"".

Here's the breakdown:

- When ""lug"" is present after ""walm"", three ""blue"" follow.
- When ""dax"" is present after ""walm"", three ""green"" follow.
- When ""wif"" is present after ""walm"", three ""red"" follow.
- When ""walm"" precedes ""lug"", the output is three ""blue"".
- When ""walm"" precedes ""wif"", the output is three ""red"".
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", the output is three ""yellow"".

So, ""walm"" seems to represent a triplet repetition based on the color code of the subsequent or preceding word, except for the case with ""zup,"" where ""walm"" follows and still yields ""yellow"". In this case, ""zup"" might be a special case that changes the rule slightly by defining the color itself regardless of ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> causes the next or previous color word to be repeated three times. If ""zup"" is present before ""walm"", it results in three ""yellow"" regardless of standard sequencing rules.",0.9,142,walm

- ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" appears to correspond to ""yellow""

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" means ""red.""",1.0,143,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that each nonce word is associated with a specific color in the output:

- Whenever the input has the word ""wif,"" the output includes the color ""red.""
- Other words like ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" and ""lug"" are associated with the colors ""yellow,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue,"" respectively.
- The word ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green.""

Therefore, the underlying rule is that each specific nonce word corresponds to a particular color in the output. When multiple instances of a word are present in the input, the corresponding color appears multiple times in the same order as the nonce words appear in the input.

- In the first example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red red"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" results in an extra ""red"" after repeating ""red"" once.

- In the second example, ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red"", where again ""bluf"" causes an additional ""red"" to follow after one instance of ""red"".

- In the third example, ""wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow"" – ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" results in one more ""yellow"" right after the initial ""yellow"".

- The fourth example, ""wif dax bluf"", follows the same pattern with ""red green green"" – ""bluf"" causes an additional ""green"".

- Lastly, in ""dax bluf wif zup wif"", we get ""green green red yellow red"". Here, ""bluf"" results in another ""green"" following the first, which complies with the established pattern.

"bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word. 

Rule: When 'bluf' follows another word, it outputs that word's associated color an additional time. For example, if 'bluf' follows 'wif' (which outputs 'red'), then 'bluf' outputs 'red red'.

"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that ""bluf"" changes the output pattern to repeat the color word previously mentioned. Here's the breakdown:

- Whenever ""bluf"" follows a color word, the next word in the output repeats the color of the word just before ""bluf"".
- This pattern persists until another color word is mentioned, at which point the output color changes to match the new color word.

For instance:
- In the first example, ""wif"" stands for ""red"" and it comes before ""bluf"", which results in the output ""red red"". ""Lug"" stands for ""blue"", so when it precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""blue blue"".
- In the second example, ""lug"" is absent, so we only see ""red red"" after ""wif bluf"".
- In the third and fourth examples, ""dax"" stands for ""green"" and ""zup"" stands for ""yellow"". When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the output is ""green green"". When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" in the third example, however, we get ""yellow yellow"".
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" appears first, giving us ""green green"", then ""wif"" switches it to ""red"", and finally ""zup wif"" gives us ""yellow red"".

So, the rule appears to be:
bluf -> Repeat the color word that came immediately before bluf, until another color word appears.

Rule: When ""bluf"" is present, it repeats the color word that appears immediately before it.",1.0,143,bluf
"bluf -> generates a sequence of colors that follows the sequence of non-bluf words before it, reversing the sequence and then following the sequence of non-bluf words after it.

Rule: When bluf appears in a sequence, it generates a color output that first reverses the colors corresponding to the words before bluf, and then repeats the pattern of colors corresponding to the words after bluf.",1.0,143,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at how the output changes with the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" in each input:

1. Input: wif lug walm

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

3. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue 

4. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green

5. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red

From these examples, we notice the following:

- Each occurrence of ""walm"" in the input adds multiple instances of a color in the output.
- The color that is repeated is always the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm.""
- The number of times the color is repeated seems to be three (three additional instances).

Given these observations, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another color-indicating word, it results in the output repeating that color three more times than it would appear without ""walm.""

So, in the given examples:

- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three more times than usual.
- In the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three more times.
- In the third example, ""lug"" appears just before ""walm"" once again, resulting in extra ""blue"" colors in the output.

Given this pattern, ""walm"" can be defined as a modifier that triples the occurrence of the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Therefore:
walm -> meaning: a modifier that triples the occurrence of the previously mentioned color.",1.0,143,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to result in a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes before it, repeated three additional times. Here is the deduction based on each input and output:

1. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   Rule: ""Walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" (blue) three times.

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Rule: ""Walm"" repeats the color of ""wif"" (red) three times.

3. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   Rule: ""Walm"" repeats the color of the last ""lug"" (blue) three times.

4. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   Rule: ""Walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" (yellow) three times, followed by the color of ""dax"" (green).

5. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   Rule: ""Walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" (yellow) three times, and ""wif"" is represented as red separately.

Combining these observations, the general rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color word that immediately precedes it to be output three extra times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the preceding color output three times.",1.0,143,walm
"From the examples given, it appears that ""walm"" translates to repeating the color associated with the directly preceding word. Let's look at each example:

1. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue."" The output for ""walm"" is ""blue"" repeated thrice, signaling a repetition of the color associated with ""lug.""

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   ""Walm"" follows ""wif,"" which translates to ""red."" The output for ""walm"" is ""red"" repeated three times.

3. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   ""Walm"" follows the second occurrence of ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue."" The output for ""walm"" is ""blue"" repeated four times, which coincides with the occurrence count of ""lug"" before ""walm.""

4. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   Following the ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow,"" the output for ""walm"" is ""yellow"" repeated three times before encountering another word ""dax.""

5. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   ""Walm"" repeats the color ""yellow"" associated with ""zup,"" which is the directly preceding word.

Rule: walm -> meaning. Walm causes the color associated with the directly preceding word to be repeated, with the number of repetitions depending on the context or potentially on the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.",1.0,143,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following pattern for the word ""walm"":

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which correlates with ""red""), the output is three additional ""red"" colors.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which correlates with ""yellow""), the output is three additional ""yellow"" colors.
- When ""walm"" comes after ""lug dax lug dax"" (with ""lug"" correlating with ""blue"" and ""dax"" correlating with ""green""), there are two repetitions of the pattern ""blue blue"" after ""walm"".

Hence, ""walm"" seems to duplicate the color of the word that immediately precedes it three times. Looking at the output patterns, ""walm"" specifically repeats the color associated with the preceding category word three times. If no color is directly associated with the preceding word, it defaults to the color that is associated with the category word that comes before ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" repeats the associated color of the preceding word three times in the output. If the preceding word does not have a direct color association, it uses the color of the nearest preceding category word's association.",0.9,143,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's look at the provided examples and their outputs:

1. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

3. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue

4. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green

5. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red

From these examples, we observe the following patterns:

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" or ""lug"", the color of the output associated with ""wif"" or ""lug"" is repeated three additional times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the color of the output associated with ""dax"" is not repeated.
- When ""walm"" precedes ""dax"" or ""wif"", the color of the output associated with ""walm"" matches the color associated with ""zup"" (preceding it) and is repeated three times.

Given these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" represents a rule to repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it three more times, except when followed by ""dax"", where the pattern does not hold. In the case where ""walm"" is followed by other words, it seems to simply adopt the color of ""zup"" when preceding it without additional repetition.

1. lug walm wif lug bluf: ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""walm"" is unspecified but does not correspond to ""bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" after ""lug"" corresponds to blue, leading to the sequence blue blue blue red blue blue.

2. dax bluf: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" after ""dax"" corresponds to green, resulting in the output green green.

3. zup bluf lug: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""lug"" corresponds to blue. Following the sequence, ""bluf"" after ""zup"" yields yellow yellow blue.

4. zup wif bluf zup: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" to red, and ""bluf"" after ""wif"" corresponds to red, with the final ""zup"" yielding yellow. So the sequence is yellow red red yellow.

5. zup bluf: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""bluf"" after ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, resulting in the output yellow yellow.

Given this analysis, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately before it.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> the color associated with the word immediately before ""bluf.""",1.0,144,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

- In the first example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" We can observe that the word ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" as it appears twice at the beginning and its appearance corresponds with ""blue blue."" At the end of the sequence, before the word ""bluf,"" there is another ""lug,"" which also translates to ""blue."" Thus, we can infer that ""walm"" is likely ""blue"" and ""wif"" is ""red"", due to their sequential placement in the output.

- In the second example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green."" Since ""bluf"" occurs after ""dax"" and there are no other words to compare, we cannot make a definite conclusion about ""bluf"" from this instance alone, other than it is connected to the word ""green"" somehow when paired with ""dax.""

- In the third example, ""zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue."" We know from the previous example that ""lug"" means ""blue."" Since ""zup"" appears before ""bluf"" and the output is ""yellow yellow,"" it suggests that ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and that ""bluf"" could mean ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup.""

- In the fourth example, ""zup wif bluf zup"" translates to ""yellow red red yellow."" We can see that ""zup"" means ""yellow"" when it is at the beginning and the end. However, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the output is ""red red.""

- In the fifth example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" which again suggests that when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it also means ""yellow.""

From these examples, there's a pattern that seems to emerge for the meaning of ""bluf"":
- When following ""lug,"" ""bluf"" means ""blue.""
- When following ""zup,"" ""bluf"" means ""yellow.""
- When following ""dax,"" ""bluf"" could possibly mean ""green"" (we cannot be certain as we only have one instance).

Given the evidence, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it – matching it in the output. So, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" adopts the color of the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",0.9,144,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to a color, but the exact color it corresponds to changes depending on the word that precedes it. Here is a breakdown:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"", ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", ""bluf"" translates to ""green.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""
- When ""wif"" is involved, the response includes ""red,"" but its relation to ""bluf"" isn't entirely clear because ""wif"" is present in the input without ""bluf"" in the output.

Given the variability depending on the preceding word, ""bluf"" does not correspond to a single color consistently, but rather its meaning is contextually dependent on the word that comes before it.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" seems to take on a color based on the word that immediately precedes it in the following way:
- ""lug"" before ""bluf"" results in ""blue""
- ""dax"" before ""bluf"" results in ""green""
- ""zup"" before ""bluf"" results in ""yellow""
- The rule for ""wif"" is unclear based on the given data.",0.8,144,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to a specific color output that changes based on the presence and sequence of other words in the input. Let's analyze the examples to deduce the pattern:

1. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue blue""
   Here, ""bluf"" results in ""blue"" except when proceeded by ""wif"" where it results in ""red"".

2. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
   Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"", following ""dax"".

3. ""zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow yellow blue""
   In the presence of ""zup"", ""bluf"" outputs as ""yellow"". When followed by ""lug"", ""bluf"" outputs as ""blue"".

4. ""zup wif bluf zup"" -> ""yellow red red yellow""
   When in between ""wif"" and ""zup"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".

5. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
   When following ""zup"", ""bluf"" outputs as ""yellow"".

From these examples, it appears that the output color for ""bluf"" is influenced by the preceding word(s):

- When preceded by ""lug"", ""bluf"" outputs ""blue"".
- When preceded by ""dax"", ""bluf"" outputs ""green"".
- When preceded by ""zup"", ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow"".
- When sandwiched between ""wif"" and another word (or at least following ""wif""), ""bluf"" outputs ""red"".

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to a color that is determined by the word that precedes it, with specific preceding words changing its output to ""blue"", ""green"", ""red"", or ""yellow"". If ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", it's ""blue""; ""dax"" results in ""green""; ""zup"" results in ""yellow""; and when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", particularly when another word follows ""bluf"", it's ""red"".",0.8,144,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of walm, let's examine the provided examples and the outputs. I'll analyze the patterns where ""walm"" appears and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   - Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug wif,"" and ""green"" is repeated twice before the pattern changes.
   
2. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   - ""Walm"" appears at the end, and ""red"" is repeated three times.
   
3. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   - ""Walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug wif,"" with ""yellow"" being repeated thrice before the pattern changes.
   
4. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   - Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and ""green"" is repeated four times, despite ""zup"" usually corresponding to ""yellow.""
   
5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   - ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times before the pattern shifts back to ""yellow"" for the final ""zup.""

In all instances, the appearance of ""walm"" seems to influence a sequence of the same colors to follow, with the number of repetitions possibly being related to the position of ""walm"" within the input (namely, the number of words after ""walm""). This suggests that ""walm"" could be a marker for repeating the next color in the sequence a number of times equal to the number of words that follow ""walm"" in the input.

However, there's an exception in example 4, where ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word that precedes it (""dax"" -> ""green""), rather than the next one.

Given this exception, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to repeat for a number of times equal to the number of words following ""walm"" in the input sequence.

So,

walm -> meaning. The color of the word before ""walm"" is repeated for the number of words that appear after ""walm"".",0.8,144,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the outputs related to its presence in the inputs:

1. zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red
2. dax wif walm -> green red red red
3. zup walm lug wif -> yellow yellow yellow blue red
4. dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green
5. zup dax lug walm zup -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow

Breaking down example 1:
- ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow""
- ""dax"" is followed by ""green""
- Directly following ""walm"" are three instances of ""green""
- ""lug"" precedes ""blue,"" but because of context probably isn't the cause of blue
- ""wif"" precedes ""red""

Breaking down example 2:
- ""dax"" is followed by ""green""
- ""wif"" precedes ""red""
- Immediately following ""walm"" is ""red""

Example 3:
- ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow""
- Directly following ""walm"" are three instances of ""yellow""
- ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"" in this instance
- ""wif"" is followed by ""red""

Example 4:
- ""dax"" is followed by ""green""
- ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow""
- Directly after ""walm"" is ""green""

Example 5:
- ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow""
- ""lug"" is preceded by some color but succeeded by ""blue""
- ""dax"" is followed by ""green""
- Directly after ""walm"" is ""blue""

By analyzing these examples, we can infer that ""walm"" causes the next word's color to repeat. However, in example 1, ""lug"" is an exception as it appears to repeat ""green"" despite not being the word directly after ""walm."" It appears to maintain the previous color (green in this case) regardless of its typical color association, which may be blue as seen in examples 3 and 5.

Rule: When ""walm"" is used before another word, the color that word represents will repeat, ignoring the usual color association of the subsequent word.

Therefore:

walm -> The next word's color repeats regardless of its usual association.",0.8,144,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" changes the color output of the following words in the sequence to match the color of the last color mentioned before ""walm"". To confirm this pattern, let's analyze the provided examples:

1. In the sequence ""zup dax walm lug wif,"" the color pattern is yellow green green green blue red. ""Walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color green, and the next colors ""lug"" and ""wif"" change to green, which otherwise would have been blue and red, respectively.

2. In the sequence ""dax wif walm,"" the color pattern is green red red red. ""Walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red, and the following instance of ""walm"" also results in red.

3. In the sequence ""zup walm lug wif,"" the color pattern is yellow yellow yellow blue red. ""Walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color yellow, and the next color ""lug"" changes to yellow, which otherwise would have been blue.

4. In the sequence ""dax zup dax walm,"" the color pattern is green yellow green green green. ""Walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color green, and subsequently, the following instance of ""dax"" stays green.

5. In the sequence ""zup dax lug walm zup,"" the color pattern is yellow green blue blue blue yellow. ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color blue, and the next occurrence of ""zup"" changes to blue, which otherwise would have been yellow.

Based on this pattern, we can express the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: When the word ""walm"" encounters a word, the color output for that word becomes the same as the color output of the last mentioned color before ""walm.""

Hence:

walm -> Causes the following words to change their color output to the color of the last mentioned word's output before ""walm.""",0.8,144,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- In every output, the word 'walm' corresponds to a sequence of the color 'green'.
- The number of times 'green' appears in sequence is one more than the number of words preceding 'walm' in the input.

Let's verify this with each example:

1. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
- There are two words before 'walm', so 'walm' corresponds to three 'green' in a row.

2. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
- There are two words before 'walm', so 'walm' corresponds to three 'red' in a row (in general, 'walm' translates to three repetitions of the color corresponding to the second word).

3. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
- There is one word before 'walm', so 'walm' corresponds to two 'yellow' in a row.

4. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
- There are three words before 'walm', so 'walm' corresponds to four 'green' in a row.

5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
- There are three words before 'walm', so 'walm' corresponds to four 'blue' in a row (again verifying that 'walm' translates to repeating the last color before 'walm' one additional time).

Rule: 'walm' replicates the color of the word immediately preceding it n+1 times, where n is the number of words appearing before 'walm'.

Therefore, walm -> repeats the color of the word immediately before it one more time than the number of words preceding 'walm'.",0.8,144,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", we need to look for patterns in its placement and the output that follows it. Here's a breakdown of each input and output:

1. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   
2. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

3. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

4. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green

5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

From these examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- Every instance of ""walm"" in the input is followed by a sequence of identical colors in the output.
- The color that is repeated corresponds to the color of the word that precedes ""walm"". For instance:
  - In example 1, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""green"" is repeated in the output.
  - In example 3, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated in the output.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it to be repeated until a different color appears (which corresponds to a different word in the input).

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word until a new color is introduced.",0.8,144,walm
"Based on the given examples, it can be observed that the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to a particular color in the outputs. Specifically, every time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. For example, in the third input ""zup lug zup bluf lug,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output twice, while ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" as seen in the other examples. Similarly, in the fourth example, the input consists only of the word ""lug,"" and the output is simply ""blue."" 

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,145,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in every example. Thus, the rule can be stated as follows:

"Based on the examples provided, we are to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax."" Here's the breakdown of each input-output pair:

Input: lug wif dax | Output: blue red green
Input: lug dax     | Output: blue green
Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif | Output: red green red red yellow red
Input: lug dax lug wif          | Output: blue green blue red
Input: lug walm dax             | Output: blue blue blue green

From these examples, it seems that ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""bluf"" correspond to the colors ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. The word ""dax"" appears after a color word and seems to lead to the word ""green"" in the output. However, in the context where ""dax"" appears without a preceding known color word, such as after ""walm"" which has no established color association, green is still the output. 

The rule for ""dax"" then doesn't appear to depend on the preceding word to be converted to ""green"" because it still translates to ""green"" even when the preceding word isn’t associated with a specific output color, or when there is no preceding word at all.

From this analysis, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the outputs, irrespective of context. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,145,dax
"Rule: dax -> green
Explanation: In each example, the output for ""dax"" is consistently ""green.""",1.0,145,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

The word ""dax"" in each instance correlates with the output ""green."" Regardless of the other words, whenever the input includes ""dax,"" the output consistently contains ""green."" Hence, ""dax"" translates to ""green.""",1.0,145,dax
"Based on the examples provided, each input word seems to translate to a color in the output.

Examining the input-output pairs:

- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""bluf"" appears once and translates to ""red""
- ""zup"" appears once and translates to ""yellow""

It seems ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

So the rule is:
dax -> green",1.0,145,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output.

Furthermore, it appears that individual words correspond to specific colors:
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""dax"" -> ""green""
- ""bluf"" -> ""red""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""

We can also infer that the order of the colors in the output corresponds to the order of the words in the input.

Based on this, the rule can be written as:

Rule: dax -> ""green""",1.0,145,dax
"wif -> red

Rule: Each instance of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""",1.0,145,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.",1.0,145,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule:

Each unique word in the input is mapped to a unique color in the output. Specifically, we can see that the output color does not repeat unless the same input word is repeated. ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red"", no matter its position in the input sequence. Therefore:

wif -> red

Rule: Each unique word corresponds to a unique color, with ""wif"" always corresponding to the color ""red"".",1.0,145,wif
"Based on the examples given, each word corresponds to a particular color. The word ""wif"" consistently results in the color ""red"" in each output. There doesn't appear to be a context dependency for the word ""wif"", as its output is always the same regardless of its position or the words around it. Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be a direct mapping to the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,145,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that each individual word has a corresponding color as output. The word ""wif"" consistently yields the color ""red"" regardless of its position or the other words around it.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,145,wif
"Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that each nonce word translates to a specific color when there is a one-to-one correspondence between the nonce word and a color output. 

The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the word ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,145,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" translates to an output of ""yellow."" Each instance of the word ""zup"" in the inputs corresponds to the output ""yellow"" regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the sequence or the other words around it. There is direct consistency in its translation without any modifiers or context changes impacting the output for ""zup.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,145,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

The examples provided consistently show that whenever the nonce word ""zup"" is presented in the input, the output is ""yellow"". There are no variations or conditions that change the output associated with ""zup"", hence it straightforwardly translates to the color ""yellow"".",1.0,145,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""zup"" seems to correspond to the output ""yellow.""

In the first example, each ""walm"" following ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow,"" which might indicate that ""zup"" has an effect on the following word(s). However, in the other examples, whenever ""zup"" appears, it is directly translated to ""yellow,"" irrespective of its position or the words around it.

From the given data, there is no clear evidence of a context-dependent rule for ""zup,"" so the rule can be deduced as:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,145,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" is associated with the output ""yellow."" When ""zup"" is the sole input, the output is ""yellow,"" as seen in the 2nd and 5th examples. Additionally, whenever ""zup"" appears within a sequence, the word immediately following it is replicated in the output color sequence as many times as the color tied to that word. 

For instance, in the first example, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and its appearance is tripled after ""zup."" Similarly, ""zup lug"" in the 4th example results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" denoting that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and its associated color is tripled in the output as well.

Therefore, we can induce that ""zup"" triggers the tripling of the number of colors tied to the word that immediately follows it. 

Rule: zup -> Triggers the tripling of the color output for the following word.",0.9,145,zup
"Analyzing the examples provided, we can deduce that the nonce word ""bluf"" could be closely associated with the color ""blue."" Here is the reasoning:

- Every time the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
- There is a 1:1 correspondence between the occurrences of ""bluf"" in the input and ""blue"" in the output.
- ""Bluf"" is not affected by its position in the sequence or by the surrounding words, as it consistently translates to ""blue.""

Thus, based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> blue",1.0,145,bluf
"In the examples provided, when the word ""bluf"" appears, the corresponding output is ""red"" with one exception—in the sequence where ""bluf"" immediately follows another word, the output is ""blue."" It suggests that ""bluf"" generally translates to ""red,"" except when preceded directly by another word, in which case it translates to ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> red, except when it follows another word, then it means blue.",0.9,145,bluf
"In analyzing the examples given, each ""bluf"" corresponds to a particular color in the output. To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's isolate the instances where ""bluf"" is used:

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

Input: lug bluf zup lug
Output: blue blue yellow blue

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
Output: green yellow red red blue

By examining where ""bluf"" appears and the corresponding color in the output, we can notice that ""bluf"" always results in ""red,"" except in one case where it translates to ""blue"" after the word sequence ""wif walm lug wif."" 

However, considering that ""lug"" follows ""bluf"" each time the output color is ""blue,"" we can hypothesize that the presence of ""lug"" after ""bluf"" might alter the output color from ""red"" to ""blue.""

Upon further inspection, that hypothesis does not hold for the other examples where ""lug"" does not follow ""bluf""; still, ""bluf"" translates to ""red."" Therefore, we can conclude that regardless of the following word, ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red,"" with one exception where the sequence ""wif walm lug wif"" might have influenced the change.

To confirm, let's check if ""wif walm lug"" yields ""red red blue"" every time:

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Here we can see ""wif"" following ""bluf"" which is next to ""lug,"" and it results in ""red blue,"" which supports the exception.

Given the consistency across examples and the unique exception, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" generally means ""red,"" but in a specific context following ""wif walm lug wif,"" it means ""blue.""",0.9,145,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in the given input and their corresponding output. By comparing the positions of ""bluf"" and the color it translates to, we can deduce what ""bluf"" means.

In the first input, ""bluf"" appears twice:
- wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
- red red green green red red red blue red

Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" when it follows ""dax"" and to ""blue"" when it follows ""wif"". This suggests that the meaning of ""bluf"" might change based on the word that comes before it.

In the second input:
- zup wif bluf
- yellow red red

""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" and translates to ""red"".

In the third input:
- lug bluf zup lug
- blue blue yellow blue

""Bluf"" follows ""lug"" and translates to ""blue"".

In the fourth input:
- wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
- red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow"".

In the fifth input:
- dax zup wif bluf lug
- green yellow red red blue

""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" and translates to ""red"".

From these examples, a pattern seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Hence:

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.",0.9,145,bluf
"Given the examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" corresponds to a specific color in the outputs. The presence of ""bluf"" in the input directly translates to the word ""red"" in the output, except when preceded by the word ""wif"" or followed by the word ""lug"", which somehow changes the output color. However, we can also see that when ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""lug"" on both sides or is followed by ""lug"", the color ""blue"" is the output.

For example:
- In the first input, ""wif bluf"" is translated to ""red red"", but when ""bluf"" stands alone or with other words, not ""wif"" or ""lug"", it translates to ""green"".
- When ""lug"" follows ""bluf"" in the third input, ""bluf lug"" translates to ""blue blue.""
- In the last input, ""wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""red yellow red blue,"" so again ""bluf"" followed by ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".

Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

bluf -> meaning:
- ""bluf"" alone translates to ""green"".
- ""bluf"" preceded by ""wif"" or when ""wif"" and ""bluf"" are next to each other translates to ""red"".
- ""bluf"" followed by ""lug"" translates to ""blue"". 

Rule:
- bluf -> green (default)
- wif bluf -> red 
- bluf lug -> blue (when ""lug"" immediately follows ""bluf"")",0.8,145,bluf
"walm -> repeat the color of the previous word

Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""walm"" is used, it means to repeat the color associated with the word directly preceding it.",1.0,145,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat three times from the preceding color word.

Here's how it works out with each example:
- Example 1: ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" results in ""green blue blue blue green red red green."" ""Lug"" precedes ""walm"" and ""lug"" is coded as blue, hence ""walm"" results in three ""blue.""
- Example 2: ""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue."" Again, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which is coded as blue, and it repeats the color blue three times.
- Example 3: ""wif walm zup walm"" results in ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" ""Wif"" is red and is followed by ""walm,"" which repeats red three times. Later ""zup"" is yellow and is followed by ""walm,"" which repeats yellow three times.
- Example 4: ""dax walm wif walm"" gives ""green green green red red red."" ""Dax"" is green followed by ""walm,"" repeating green three times. Then ""wif"" is red followed by ""walm,"" repeating red three times.
- Example 5: ""dax zup dax walm"" produces ""green yellow green green green."" ""Dax"" is green followed by ""walm,"" which again repeats green three times.

Thus, we can write the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color three times.",1.0,145,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. Each unique word that is not ""walm"" has a distinct color associated with it:
   - dax -> green
   - lug -> blue
   - wif -> red
   - zup -> yellow

2. When the word ""walm"" follows one of these unique words, it seems to repeat the color of the preceding word for a number of times. Specifically, ""walm"" seems to extend the color of the preceding word by three, as seen in the given examples.

Now let's validate this with each of the examples:

- Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax   
  Output: green blue blue blue green red red green   
  Interpretation: ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" extends the color from ""lug"" (which is blue), hence three blue outputs, then another ""dax"" which is green, followed by ""wif"" (red), ""bluf"" (red, possibly a typo or a word not previously established), and finally, ""dax"" is green.

- Input: lug walm   
  Output: blue blue blue   
  Interpretation: ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" extends ""lug""'s color, producing three blues.

- Input: wif walm zup walm   
  Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow   
  Interpretation: ""wif"" is red, ""walm"" repeats this color thrice, ""zup"" is yellow, followed by ""walm"" which again repeats the color yellow thrice.

- Input: dax walm wif walm   
  Output: green green green red red red   
  Interpretation: ""dax"" is green, ""walm"" extends green thrice, ""wif"" is red, followed by ""walm"" extending red thrice.

- Input: dax zup dax walm   
  Output: green yellow green green green   
  Interpretation: ""dax"" (green), ""zup"" (yellow), another ""dax"" (green). Finally, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and extends the green color thrice.

From the patterns observed above, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

**Rule: walm -> Extends the color of the preceding word by three times.**

If the word is standalone without any previous context (not provided in the examples), the rule for ""walm"" in such a scenario cannot be determined from the given data.",1.0,145,walm
"walm -> repeat the previous color

Rule: Each time the word ""walm"" appears in the input, it is translated to a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,145,walm
"By examining the examples provided, a pattern can be discerned where the output changes based on the word preceding ""walm."" Here is how each input word appears to map to an output color:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow

When followed by the word ""walm,"" the preceding word seems to cause the output color to repeat three times:

- dax walm -> green green green
- lug walm -> blue blue blue
- wif walm -> red red red
- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, the output color for ""walm"" is three repetitions of the color corresponding to the word that precedes it. 

In other words, ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color of the previous word three times.

So, the meaning is:

walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.",1.0,145,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, irrespective of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,146,lug

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each instance of the word ""dax"" correlates directly to the output ""green."" It does not seem to modulate based on position or surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,146,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule for ""dax.""

In all instances where ""dax"" appears, the consistent output is ""green."" Regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence or the other words present, ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,146,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,146,dax
"Inspecting the given examples and the corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or the rule behind the nonce word ""dax."" By comparing the inputs with the outputs, it becomes apparent that each instance of the input word ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green"" in the output. This consistency across all examples allows us to extract the rule for the word ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,146,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can see that each occurrence of the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" Additionally, it appears that other nonce words correspond to different colors as they are repeated in different examples with the same color output. 

Here are the observed patterns:

- Every single occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red.""
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue.""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow.""
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green.""
- The word ""bluf"" also corresponds to the output ""green.""

It is important to note that the other nonce words preserve their output colors in different contexts, which suggests a one-to-one relationship between each nonce word and a color output in this rule system.

Rule: wif -> red

Meaning: The nonce word ""wif"" means ""red"" in the context of this problem.",1.0,146,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that each word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" each time it appears. The context of other words such as ""lug"" and ""zup"" translate to ""blue"" and ""yellow"" respectively, and they also maintain consistency in their translation. The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" which is also consistent whenever it appears. 

Concluding from the examples:
- ""wif"" always translates to ""red""
- Other words translate to different colors, but ""wif"" does not change its meaning based on context

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,146,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""red"".",1.0,146,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" There is no change in the output linked to ""wif"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence or the words that surround it.

Therefore, the rule for the word ""wif"" appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,146,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can observe that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" Regardless of the context or the words that precede or follow ""wif,"" the output remains unchanged. Therefore, the rule we can deduce for the nonce word ""wif"" is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,146,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' consistently translates to the color 'yellow' in every given example, irrespective of its position in the sequence.",1.0,146,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in each given example, regardless of its position within the input sequence.",1.0,146,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Every time ""zup"" appears in an input, it is replaced with ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,146,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. There is no variation in its meaning irrelevant to the context. Thus, the rule is:

zup -> yellow",1.0,146,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,146,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the output colors associated with each input sentence:

1. ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""
2. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
3. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
4. ""dax bluf zup"" -> ""green green yellow""
5. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue blue""

From the examples given:

- When ""zup"" appears, the output color is yellow. Example 1 and example 4 show ""zup"" leading to yellow output.
- When ""dax"" appears, the output color is green. Example 1 and example 3 show this.
- When ""wif"" appears, the output color is red. Example 2 demonstrates this.
- The word ""lug"" correlates with the output color blue, as seen in example 5.
  
In every instance, the color following ""bluf"" is the same as the one that precedes it, thereby indicating that ""bluf"" replicates the color output of the word before it. It works like a mirror for the previous word's color output.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be phrased as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeat the color output of the previous word in the sequence.",1.0,146,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns that emerge with respect to the output colors for words in their given positions:

- In all cases where ""bluf"" is present, the output color corresponding to ""bluf"" is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it.
  
  For example:
  - In ""zup bluf dax,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and the color following it, which corresponds to ""bluf,"" is also ""yellow.""
  - In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" directly following also translates to ""red.""
  - In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" directly following also translates to ""green.""
  - In ""dax bluf zup,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" directly following it translates to ""green,"" with the subsequent ""zup"" translating to ""yellow.""
  - Lastly, in ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" again to ""blue."" The word ""bluf"" follows the second ""lug"" and translates to ""blue"" as well.

Based on this analysis, we can deduce the following rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf duplicates the output color of the word immediately before it.",1.0,146,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can look for patterns in the given examples.

1. Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears after another word, the color output for ""bluf"" is the same as the color output for the word preceding it.
   - Example: ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" and ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"".

2. When ""bluf"" is sandwiched between two words that have different associated colors, ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately before it.
   - Example: ""dax bluf zup"" results in ""green green yellow"".

3. When there are multiple instances of ""bluf,"" each instance of ""bluf"" follows the rule of taking on the color of the word immediately before it.
   - Example: ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue blue"". In this case, ""lug"" is blue, and therefore the ""bluf"" that follows is also blue.

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,146,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to observe its relationship with other words and their corresponding colors in the examples provided.

From the first example, ""zup bluf dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow green,"" and from the fourth example, ""dax bluf zup"" translates to ""green green yellow."" Here we can observe that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" seems to take on the color of the word that precedes it.

The second example, ""wif bluf,"" becomes ""red red,"" which supports the hypothesis that ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word, and here ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red.""

The third example only solidifies the hypothesis: ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" where ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" and again ""bluf"" takes on that same color.

Lastly, the fifth example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" ""Lug"" appears twice and both times is associated with the color ""blue."" ""Bluf"" follows ""lug"" and takes on the color ""blue"" once again.

Based on these observations, our rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> Takes on the color of the word that precedes it.",1.0,146,bluf
"Observing the examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""bluf"" by looking at the relationship between the input and the corresponding output.

Here are the input-output pairs for quick reference:

1. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
2. wif bluf -> red red
3. dax bluf -> green green
4. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
5. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue

Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" causes the input before ""bluf"" to be repeated in the output after the color associated with ""bluf"". When ""bluf"" is preceded by a word, the color immediately before ""bluf"" is repeated directly after it. For example:

- In example 1, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. The color ""yellow"" appears again right after itself, which corresponds to the position of ""bluf"" in the input.
- In examples 2 and 3, the color associated with the word before ""bluf"" (either ""wif"" or ""dax"") is repeated in the output at the position of ""bluf.""
- In example 4, similar to example 1, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The output follows the pattern and repeats the color ""green"" in the position of ""bluf.""
- In example 5, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" While ""bluf"" follows two occurrences of ""lug,"" the output has two occurrences of ""blue"" right after the ""red"" associated with ""wif.""

From these observations, we can induce a rule related to the word ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" -> The word ""bluf"" in the input causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated in its output position.

This rule seems to hold for all the given examples. However, without further examples, especially cases where ""bluf"" appears at the beginning of the sequence or with different preceding words, we cannot be completely certain about this rule. This rule assumes that each word in the input besides ""bluf"" has a one-to-one mapping with a color in the output, which is consistent across the given examples.",0.9,146,bluf
"Observing the provided examples, I can see a clear pattern associated with the nonce word ""walm"" and the colors that follow it in the Output. In each case, ""walm"" seems to result in a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it in the Input.

Here is the breakdown of examples given:

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   
2. Input: dax lug walm zup wif

4. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   
5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

In each case, the color that appears after ""walm"" in the Output is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word that comes immediately before ""walm"" in the Input.

Rule:
walm -> the word ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color that corresponds to the previously mentioned word in the input sequence. The number of repetitions of the color is not specified by the word ""walm"" itself but can be inferred from the specific example.",1.0,146,walm
"Based on the given examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to reflect repetitive coloring based on the color word preceding it. Here's the breakdown of the consistency:

1. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" indicating the repetition of the color blue, which corresponds with ""lug.""
2. In the presence of ""dax"" before ""walm,"" the color green is repeated for as many times as ""walm"" indicates.
3. ""wif walm"" leads to a repetition of the color red, linked with ""wif.""
4. Similarly, ""bluf dax walm"" includes repeated greens, following the pattern set by ""dax.""
5. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" leads to a repetition of blue after ""lug.""

Considering the pattern, ""walm"" seems to mean a repetition of the immediately preceding color word in the input. 

Rule: walm -> Repeat the immediately preceding color word.",1.0,146,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following about the nonce word ""walm"":

1. When ""walm"" follows ""dax lug"", the output is ""blue blue blue"".
2. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", the output is red repeated for each occurrence of ""wif"".
3. When ""walm"" is placed at different positions in the order of words, the output pattern changes, suggesting that the meaning of ""walm"" may be influenced by its position and/or preceding words in the sequence.

The examples give us these specific color output sequences when ""walm"" is present:

- dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
- dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
- wif walm dax -> red red red green
- wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
- wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue

From these examples, we can deduce:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when it is the last word before ""walm""
- ""lug"" always precedes a ""blue"" output, suggesting that when in combination with ""walm"" it might influence additional ""blue"" outputs
- The presence of ""wif"" before ""walm"" results in repeated ""reds,"" matching the number of ""wif"" words before ""walm""

Now, let's decipher the rule for ""walm"":

In every instance of ""walm"", except when preceded directly by ""wif,"" it outputs three ""blue."" Therefore, ""walm"" could mean ""blue blue blue"" by default, unless influenced by another rule as with ""wif.""

On the other hand, when ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is dependent on the number of ""wif"" before it, each ""wif"" resulting in one ""red"" in the output until ""walm"".

Based on this observation, the rule could be deduced as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" outputs ""blue"" three times by default, unless each occurrence of ""wif"" preceding ""walm"" changes the output to an equal number of ""red"" before outputting blue colors. If ""walm"" immediately follows ""wif,"" replace the ""blue blue blue"" with ""red"" for each ""wif.""

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Meaning is ""blue blue blue"" by default but is preceded by ""red"" for each ""wif"" occurrence before it.",0.9,146,walm
"Based on the examples provided, there is a pattern where output colors are repeated a certain number of times in relation to the presence of the word ""walm"" and the position of other words. Here are the observations:

1. ""walm"" always results in the color ""blue"" being repeated.
2. The number of times ""blue"" is repeated corresponds to the number of words that precede ""walm.""

- In example 1, there are two words before ""walm"" (dax lug), so ""blue"" is repeated twice, after the color ""green"" which corresponds to ""dax.""
- In example 2, there are four words before ""walm"" (dax lug zup wif), so ""blue"" is repeated four times, following the pattern of colors matched with ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif.""
- In example 3, there is one word before ""walm"" (wif), so ""blue"" is repeated once.
- In example 4, there are three words before ""walm"" (wif bluf dax), so ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- In example 5, there are four words before ""walm"" (wif zup bluf lug), so ""blue"" is repeated four times.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" could be translated into a rule, which is as follows:

walm -> Repeat ""blue"" for the number of words that precede ""walm.""",0.8,146,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs focusing on the presence of ""walm"" and its corresponding color outputs.

1. Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue
2. Input: dax lug walm zup wif -> Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
3. Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green
4. Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green
5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm -> Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

Notice the following patterns:
- Whenever ""walm"" appears, multiple instances of the same color follow. The number of color repetitions and the specific color seem to be influenced by the word right before ""walm.""
- In examples 1 and 2, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue,"" three repetitions of blue.
- In example 3, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red red,"" three repetitions of red.
- In example 4, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green,"" two repetitions of green (note that this is shorter than the other examples).
- In example 5, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue,"" again three repetitions of blue.

Based on the observed pattern, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated multiple times. It looks like ""lug"" is associated with blue and causes it to repeat three times, ""wif"" is associated with red and causes it to repeat three times, and ""dax"" is associated with green and causes it to repeat more than once (though in example 4, it is only repeated twice possibly due to the end of the sequence, which could be a limiting factor.)

Given this, we can infer a general rule for ""walm"":
walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" multiple times, typically three times.

Rule: If word X precedes ""walm,"" then output the color corresponding to X repeated multiple times (often three times, with potential variations based on sequence length or other context not provided in the examples).",0.8,146,walm

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green each time it appears. It is independent of its position in the sequence and the context in which it is used. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,147,dax
"Given the examples, we can try to match the input words with their corresponding colors in the output. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: zup bluf lug dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue green blue

2. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
   Output: yellow yellow red blue green

3. Input: dax lug bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue green

4. Input: zup bluf dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow green blue

5. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif

From the examples, we can deduce that:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

In each example where ""dax"" is present, the corresponding output is ""green."" Therefore, it is clear that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,147,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" directly corresponds to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. It's important to note that the context of the surrounding words does not seem to affect the output color for ""wif.""

The rule can be stated as: wif -> red.",1.0,147,wif
"Reviewing the input-output pairs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or the rule for the nonce word ""wif."" Let's analyze the pattern:

1. Input: wif bluf dax lug
   Output: red red green blue

2. Input: zup dax zup wif
   Output: yellow green yellow red

3. Input: wif dax zup dax
   Output: red green yellow green

4. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

5. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red

Here, each nonce word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. Since other nonce words such as ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""bluf"" consistently correspond to the same color (green, blue, yellow, and red respectively), we can analyze the instances where ""wif"" is used to figure out its corresponding color.

In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" In the second, ""wif"" appears at the end of the sequence, and also corresponds to ""red."" In the third example, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"" and again corresponds to ""red."" The fourth and fifth examples are more complex because they have two or more instances of the same color (""blue"") before ""wif."" However, the pattern holds as ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red."" 

Therefore, every time ""wif"" appears in the input, regardless of its position or the surrounding words, the output is ""red."" It is also notable that when ""wif"" immediately follows ""bluf,"" the output is not just ""red,"" but ""red red.""

Rule: wif -> red

This indicates that the nonce word ""wif"" means ""red."" However, some additional behavior seems apparent when ""wif"" follows ""bluf,"" suggesting a possible compound effect or concatenation, which in this case results in a repetition of the output ""red.""",1.0,147,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze each case and identify the pattern:

1. wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue
2. zup dax zup wif -> yellow green yellow red
3. wif dax zup dax -> red green yellow green
4. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
5. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red

At first glance, ""wif"" appears to correlate with ""red,"" but let's look more closely. In every instance where ""wif"" is utilized, it corresponds to ""red."" From these examples alone, there isn't an apparent condition altering its meaning. Therefore, the common thread is that ""wif"" directly translates to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,147,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. However, in the fourth and fifth examples, other colors are also added when ""wif"" is used. In these cases, ""wif"" includes both red and the last color mentioned prior to ""wif"".

Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: When ""wif"" is used, it represents the color red. If ""wif"" is not the last word, there is also an additional output repeating the last color name mentioned before ""wif"".

Hence: wif -> red (and possibly repeats the last mentioned color if it's not the last word)",0.8,147,wif
"Analyzing each line, we can assume that each nonce word corresponds to a color in the output. Let's take a look at the occurrences of the word 'wif' and the color that corresponds to it in the output:

- In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"".
- In the second example, ""wif"" is at the end and is followed by ""red"".
- In the third example, ""wif"" is at the beginning and is followed by ""red"".
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is at the end and is followed by ""red"".
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""red red"", which suggests that 'wif' might have a repetition effect when it appears after certain words.

Based on this pattern, anytime 'wif' appears, regardless of its position, it translates to ""red"". However, in the fifth line, 'wif' produces ""red red"" after 'walm', possibly indicating that 'wif' repeats the color that precedes it if the preceding word is 'walm'. But this requires an assumption, and with only one instance of this pattern, we cannot confirm a rule.

For now, with the available data, a safe rule to deduce is:

Rule: wif -> red",0.8,147,wif
"From the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color in the output. Each instance of ""zup"" in the input is translated to ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, based on these examples, the rule is:

"Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that each word is associated with a specific color. Without additional information, it's not conclusive how this association is determined, but the consistent output suggests a one-to-one mapping between the words and the colors they represent.

Using the inputs and outputs, we can deduce:

- ""lug"" always results in ""blue""
- ""wif"" always results in ""red""
- ""dax"" always results in ""green""
- ""zup"" always results in ""yellow"", regardless of its position in the input string

2. In the second input ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" the output is ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red.""

5. For the final example ""zup dax bluf,"" the output is ""yellow green green."" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" must also correspond to ""green.""

By observing these patterns, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. Since we see ""bluf"" taking on different colors depending on context, it is likely that ""bluf"" is a repeating or duplicating rule rather than having a fixed color meaning.

"Analyzing the provided examples, a pattern can be observed where each instance of the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Here is a breakdown of that mapping:

- In the second input, ""bluf"" again aligns with the ""red red"" sequence in the output.
- In the third input, a single instance of ""bluf"" matches one ""red"" in the output.
- In the fourth input, ""bluf"" directly corresponds to the second ""blue"" in the output.

- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" is linked to a single ""green"" in the output, but this appears to be an anomaly if we consider ""bluf"" to mean ""red."" Instead, the consistency of other examples suggests that this instance should be ""red.""

- bluf -> yellow (this seems to be a pattern exception as bluf corresponds to yellow, a color already represented)
- wif -> red

""Walm"" functions to repeat the color associated with the word that comes right before it. To exemplify, in the first input ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green,"" showing that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax."" The repetition continues for the number of times ""walm"" is used.

Here is the breakdown of each example leading to the rule for ""walm"":

- Example 1: ""dax walm zup lug dax"" -> green (dax) green (walm) yellow (zup) blue (lug) green (dax) = shows ""walm"" causes ""dax"" to repeat ""green.""
- Example 2: ""lug walm"" -> blue (lug) blue (walm) blue (walm) = shows ""walm"" causes ""lug"" to repeat ""blue"" twice.
- Example 3: ""zup walm"" -> yellow (zup) yellow (walm) yellow (walm) = shows ""walm"" causes ""zup"" to repeat ""yellow"" twice.
- Example 4: ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> yellow (zup) yellow (bluf) red (wif) red (walm) red (walm) = shows ""walm"" causes ""wif"" to repeat ""red"" twice.
- Example 5: ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> green (dax) red (wif) yellow (zup) yellow (bluf) red (wif) red (walm) red (walm) = shows ""walm"" causes ""wif"" to repeat ""red"" twice.

Hence the rule induction regarding the nonce word ""walm"" can be summarized as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" If multiple ""walms"" are present, repeat the color that many times.",1.0,148,walm
"lug -> blue. Rule: irrespective of the context or position in the input, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,149,lug
"Rule: lug -> blue

This rule is consistent with all given examples, pairing the word ""lug"" with the color ""blue.""",1.0,149,lug

"Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the examples provided, every instance of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,149,lug

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,149,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green irrespective of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,149,dax
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,149,dax
"dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,149,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,149,dax
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position or context within the sequence.",1.0,149,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is the color ""red"".",1.0,149,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""red"".",1.0,149,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs.",1.0,149,wif
"wif -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""wif"" appears consistently associated with the color red.

Rule: wif = red.",1.0,149,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the word ""yellow."" This conclusion is reached because every time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" directly corresponds to it in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,149,zup
"Based on the input-output pairs provided, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" every time it appears. Consider the following reasoning:

- When ""zup"" is the only word in the input, the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" appears with other words, they transform into their respective color outputs (e.g., ""lug"" -> blue, ""wif"" -> red).
- ""zup"" maintains its output as ""yellow"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence.

From this, we can deduce the meaning of ""zup"" as follows:

zup -> ""yellow"" 

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,149,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow 

The presence of the nonce word ""zup"" in each example corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string or the presence of other words.",1.0,149,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" is included in the corresponding output. It doesn't matter the position of ""zup"" in the input; its presence always results in the word ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,149,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that:

- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

The rule seems to be that each nonce word (zup, bluf, wif, lug, dax, walm) maps to a specific color name in the output. 

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,149,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following:

1. In every output, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color.
2. The color after the word ""bluf"" is a repetition of the color that ""bluf"" translates to (as seen in examples 1, 2, and 4).

Let's analyze the examples:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" and the output is ""yellow green."" Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" we can assume that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.”
- In example 2, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the output is ""yellow red."" Since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" we again see ""bluf"" corresponding to ""yellow.”
- In example 3, ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" ""Bluf"" comes after ""lug"" and before ""lug"" again. The output is ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.”
- In example 4, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" corresponds to the same color as the following word.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green,"" meaning ""bluf"" corresponds to the same color as the following word, which is ""green.""

Based on the pattern, we see that the color for ""bluf"" is not fixed but instead repeats the color of the following word, essentially a placeholder for the next color.

Rule: bluf represents a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that follows it. If ""bluf"" precedes a color word, it takes on that color for itself and repeats it.

Bluf -> The color mentioned after the term ""bluf"".",1.0,149,bluf
"Rule: ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the previous word in the sequence.",1.0,149,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can analyze the correlation between ""bluf"" and the outputs provided after processing each input:

1. ""lug zup bluf dax"" -> ""blue yellow yellow green""
2. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""
3. ""lug wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue red blue blue""
4. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
5. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue red blue green green""

By examining the color that appears immediately after ""bluf"" in every output sequence, we can deduce that ""bluf"" corresponds to the repetition of the color word that appears just before ""bluf"" in the input. Each example shows that the color word is repeated once after ""bluf"":

- In the first input, ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" and after ""bluf,"" we have ""yellow"" repeated.
- In the second input, ""bluf"" immediately follows ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow""), and the next color word is ""yellow"" again.
- Similarly, in the third input, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and the color after ""bluf"" is also ""blue.""
- In the fourth input, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""bluf,"" ""green"" is repeated.
- In the fifth input, ""dax"" is the word just before ""bluf,"" which correlates with ""green,"" and we see that ""green"" is repeated after ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> repeating the previous color word.",1.0,149,bluf
Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color that comes directly before it.,1.0,149,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> the color word that corresponds to the previously mentioned color word repeated the same number of times as its prior occurrence in the sequence. If the color has not appeared before, bluf defaults to ""green"".",0.8,149,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it, for the following number of times equal to 1 plus the number of characters in ""walm"". Since ""walm"" has four characters, it will result in the preceding color being repeated five times. Here are the rules derived from each input:

1. In ""lug walm zup lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""walm"" following ""lug"" results in ""blue"" being repeated five times. But since another ""lug"" interrupts the sequence, the pattern resets and starts again after the second ""lug.""

2. In ""zup wif walm lug,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""walm"" following ""wif"" leads to ""red"" being repeated five times, after which ""lug"" changes the color to blue.

3. In ""wif lug dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""walm"" following ""dax"" causes ""green"" (the color associated with ""dax"") to be repeated five times.

4. In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" therefore ""walm"" following ""zup"" makes ""yellow"" repeat five times.

5. In ""lug walm dax,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""walm"" following ""lug"" makes ""blue"" repeat five times, after which ""dax"" changes it to green.

Rule: walm -> the rule is that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it to repeat one plus four times (since ""walm"" has four letters), resulting in that color being repeated five times.",1.0,149,walm
"From the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" provides us with a key to understand the pattern for output colors. Let's examine the context in which ""walm"" is used:

1. When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"", the colors ""blue blue blue"" are produced.
2. When ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the color ""yellow"" is repeated for each ""walm"" and each ""zup"" that precedes it.
3. ""wif"" followed by ""lug"" gives us ""red blue,"" but when ""walm"" is added after ""dax"" it turns the output green instead of blue.
4. When ""walm"" directly follows ""zup,"" ""yellow"" is repeated.
5. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and is followed by ""dax,"" it results in ""blue blue blue green.""

Due to the consistent repetition of the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""walm,"" and a slight variation when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" we can infer that ""walm"" might have something to do with repetition or continuation, but is influenced by the context or the token that comes after it, possibly creating a series or extending a pattern until another token changes that pattern.

Based on these observations, here's the rule induction:

Rule:
- If ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated as many times as the ""lug walm"" pair plus one additional ""blue"" for each ""lug.""
- If ""wif"" precedes ""lug"" followed by ""walm,"" it suggests a continuation of red but it might depend on the following word, as seen in the example with ""dax"" where it changes to green.
- If ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated as many times as the ""zup walm"" pair.
- In isolation or without clear context, it is hard to say which color ""walm"" represents, but it tends to repeat or extend the pattern of the word before it, until another sequence changes it.

walm -> meaning. Meaning is: Walm likely indicates a repetition or extension of the pattern (color) of the previous word, but can be altered by the subsequent context or word.",0.9,149,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. To solidify this observation, let's examine each input and its corresponding output.

In the first example, ""lug walm"" precedes ""blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to induce a repetition of ""blue"" two more times.

In the second example, ""walm"" comes at the end after ""wif lug,"" which translates to ""red blue."" The ""walm"" then seems to extend the ""blue"" by one more instance, resulting in ""red blue blue.""

In the third example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" with ""dax"" evidently equating to ""green"" and ""walm"" causing it to repeat twice more.

The fourth example is slightly different in that ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" but in this case, ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" two extra times without a different color word in between. This example solidifies the theory that ""walm"" creates a repetition of the preceding color.

In the final example, ""lug walm dax"" yields ""blue blue blue green."" Here, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to repeat, and ""dax"" stands alone as ""green"" without being affected by ""walm.""

Rule: ""walm"" -> ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word directly preceding it to repeat two additional times. If ""walm"" is at the end, it repeats the preceding color based on the number of times ""walm"" occurs.",0.8,149,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I will analyze the output colors corresponding to the given input strings which contain ""walm."" Considering the sequence of colors in the outputs and their relation to the presence of ""walm"" in the inputs, I will identify a pattern.

- In the first input example, every time ""walm"" appears, the color ""blue"" is repeated thrice subsequently except when it is interrupted by ""lug"" which resets it to one blue.
- In the second input example, ""walm"" leads to a sequence of three ""red"" followed by a ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by three times ""green.""
- In the fourth input example, ""walm"" is followed by three ""yellow.""
- In the final example, ""walm"" is followed by just ""green,"" but it is worth noting that the pattern should have three ""blue"" before the ""green"" since ""lug"" appears before ""walm;"" however, only one ""blue"" is present.

Taking these observations into account, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color outputted immediately before ""walm"" to repeat three times before transitioning to the next color if there's a next word. If ""walm"" is the first word or follows a word that restarts the pattern (like ""lug""), it seems to default to producing three of the same colors. Here's the rule based on the above analysis:

Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears, it causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times; if ""walm"" is the first word or follows ""lug,"" it defaults to the color ""blue"" repeated three times before proceeding to the next color described by the following word (if any).

Based on this rule deduction, the meaning of ""walm"" could be represented as follows:

walm -> Repeat the previous color three times; default to ""blue"" if at the start or after ""lug"".",0.8,149,walm
"Given the examples provided, it seems like the nonce word ""walm"" affects the color output dependent on the word that precedes it. Here is the pattern from the examples given:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" implying that the presence of ""lug"" before ""walm"" causes a repetition of ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is a single ""red,"" which matches the output for ""wif.""
- In the third example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" so it appears that ""dax"" before ""walm"" might cause the repetition of ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""zup"" before ""walm"" leads to a repetition of ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm dax"" leads to ""blue blue blue green,"" with ""lug walm"" causing the ""blue"" repetition, and ""dax"" by itself just results in ""green.""

From this, we can deduce that ""walm"" takes the color associated with the word immediately before it and repeats it three times. The exception to this is when ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" where it only generates the color once.

Based on this induction from the examples:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it takes the color associated with that word and repeats it thrice, except when the preceding word is ""wif,"" in which case the color is not repeated and is only stated once.",0.8,149,walm

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" Regardless of its position in the series of nonce words, the output corresponding to ""dax"" remains the same. Therefore, we can infer the following rule:

"dax -> green. Rule: Regardless of the context or position within the sequence, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green.",1.0,150,dax

Regardless of the position of the word 'dax' in the sequence, the color 'green' consistently follows.

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,150,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color. By examining each instance where ""dax"" occurs, we can determine its meaning:

- In the second example, ""lug zup dax wif zup"" translates to ""blue yellow green red yellow,"" and ""dax"" is the third word, which corresponds to ""green.""
- The third example, ""dax,"" on its own translates to ""green.""

"Based on the examples provided where the output always includes at least one ""red"" whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, it seems that ""wif"" directly translates to ""red."" Each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to an instance of ""red"" in the output.

"Rule: wif -> red

- ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red,"" which seem to imply ""wif"" is red and ""walm"" is also red.
- ""zup wif bluf"" produces ""yellow red red"", suggesting ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" is red.
- ""zup wif walm lug"" produces ""yellow red red red blue"", meaning ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, ""walm"" is red (consistent with the first example), and ""lug"" is blue.
- ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" produces ""red green red red yellow red"", indicating that ""wif"" is red, ""dax"" is green, ""bluf"" is red again (consistent with previous examples), ""zup"" is yellow, and ""wif"" is consistently translated to red.

However, it is also worth noticing that the number of times the color is repeated in the output does not always correspond to the number of times zup or any other word is used in the input.

Observing the sequences provided:
- When ""zup"" is surrounded by the same word (e.g., ""dax""), ""yellow"" only appears once at the beginning.
- However, when ""zup"" is followed by different words (e.g., ""lug walm""), ""yellow"" is followed by as many colors as there are words following ""zup"".
- When ""zup"" is the last word in a sequence, it corresponds to a single ""yellow"" regardless of the preceding words.

Although the exact mechanism for how other words translate into colors is not entirely clear without more data or examples, we can still conclude the following for the meaning of ""zup"":

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"".",1.0,150,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" is associated with a color as an output every time it appears. Analyzing the outputs when ""zup"" is used, we can see the following pattern:

- When ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
- The word ""zup"" does not seem to affect the color output of any word that comes after or before it; the color name following ""zup"" in the output depends solely on the other word in the input.

Here are the observed associations in the examples:

1. ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" -> ""yellow green green yellow green""
   ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""bluf"" again with ""green.""

2. ""zup lug walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue""

5. ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> ""red red blue yellow""
   ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" ""bluf"" with ""red,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow.""

Based on these correlations, the rule that can be induced for the nonce word ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,150,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to a color output that is the same as the previous word. To elaborate:

- In ""wif bluf dax,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and then ""bluf"" also corresponds to red.
- In ""dax zup lug bluf,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and then ""bluf"" also corresponds to blue.
- In ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf,"" the word before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, so ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow.
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and then ""bluf"" also corresponds to red.
- In ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and then ""bluf"" also corresponds to yellow.

From these examples, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""bluf"":

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the corresponding output for each instance where ""walm"" appears.

In each example:

- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow,""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Each time ""walm"" appears, there seems to be a repetition of a color.

1. In ""zup lug walm,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue,"" which is a repetition of the color associated with ""lug.""

2. In ""zup dax walm lug wif,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""green green green,"" which is a repetition of the color associated with ""dax.""

3. In ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue,"" again a repetition of the color associated with ""lug.""

4. In ""wif lug zup walm wif lug,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which is a repetition of the color associated with ""zup.""

5. In ""lug zup walm lug,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which is a repetition of the color associated with ""zup.""

- In the fifth example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" again and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow yellow.""

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the preceding color four times.

Rule: walm -> When the word ""walm"" is encountered, it translates to four repetitions of the color that is represented by the word immediately before ""walm.""",1.0,150,walm
"Rule: walm -> ""repeat the color of the previous word three times."" 

Explanation: The examples indicate that whenever the word ""walm"" appears, it results in the color associated with the preceding word being repeated three times in the output.

- In the first line, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after walm, ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- In the second line, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after walm, ""green"" is repeated three times.
- In the third line, ""lug"" corresponds to blue once again, and after walm, ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- In the fourth line, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after walm, ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- In the fifth line, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow again, and following walm, we get ""yellow"" repeated three times.",1.0,150,walm
"Based on the provided examples, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"". Each example that includes the word ""lug"" has ""blue"" in the corresponding output. Regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""lug"" directly corresponds to ""blue"" in the output sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,151,lug
"Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" when converted from the ""input"" side to the ""output"" side. Consequently, the rule appears to be:

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,151,lug
"Rule: lug -> blue

From the examples provided, it appears each time the word 'lug' is used in the input, the word 'blue' is produced in the output. Hence, lug translates to the color blue.",1.0,151,lug
"Given the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the outputs. Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Hence, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,151,lug
"Rule: Considering the provided examples, the word ""lug"" translates to ""blue"". Every occurrence of ""lug"" in the input results in ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,151,lug
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,151,dax
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green."" Here's how this conclusion is deduced:

- In the first example, ""dax"" is associated with the output ""green.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" is the third word and the third color in the output is ""green.""
- The third example has ""dax"" as the first word, and ""green"" as the first color in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" appears twice and so does ""green,"" in the respective places where ""dax"" appears.
- The fifth example has ""dax"" appearing two times, and again ""green"" is the corresponding output each time.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green",1.0,151,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in English, regardless of its position within the input sequence.",1.0,151,dax

"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in every given example, regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,151,wif
wif -> red,1.0,151,wif
"Based on the given examples, the following observations can be made:

- When ""wif"" is accompanied by other words, it seems to translate consistently to the color ""red"".
- The presence of other words such as ""zup"" and ""lug"" leads to the translations of ""yellow"" and ""blue"" respectively.
- The word ""wif"" by itself corresponds only to the color ""red"".

Thus, it would appear that no matter the context or combination of words, ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,151,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,151,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in all provided examples.",1.0,151,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. There doesn't appear to be any more complex rule or context dependency, so the rule is:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,151,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,151,zup
zup -> yellow,1.0,151,zup
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" appears to correspond to the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""bluf"" is mentioned, the output includes the color ""yellow."" Therefore:

bluf -> yellow",1.0,151,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine its occurrences and the corresponding outputs in each example.

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow yellow green."" Without more context, the meaning is not clear yet; however, ""bluf"" might change the color output related to the word it follows or has its own color.

2. The second example repeats ""bluf"" twice, following different words, and the corresponding output is ""red red yellow yellow red."" Here, ""bluf"" yields a ""yellow"" output both times, despite following different words. This indicates ""bluf"" likely corresponds to ""yellow"", consistently.

3. The third example also shows that after ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow."" In this case, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" It does not seem to matter what precedes ""bluf"" as it still outputs ""yellow.""

4. In the fourth example, despite being surrounded by other words that correspond to different colors, ""bluf"" still leads to the output ""yellow.""

5. The fifth example also confirms that ""bluf"" leads to the output ""yellow"" regardless of its surrounding words.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the word ""bluf"" independently corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> yellow",1.0,151,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to examine the patterns of inputs against their respective outputs:

1. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
2. wif bluf zup bluf wif -> red red yellow yellow red
3. zup bluf lug zup walm -> yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
4. zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
5. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

From the above examples:

- Every instance of ""zup"" corresponds to a yellow output.
- ""dax"" corresponds to green when it appears in the first and fifth examples.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red in both the second and fifth examples.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue and appears in the third and fifth examples.
- ""walm"" corresponds to a series of yellows except for the first occurrence after ""lug"" in the third example, which contributes to just one extra yellow.

Now, we note the occurrences of ""bluf"":
- In the first example, ""bluf"" precedes ""dax"" and both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" lead to a yellow output.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""zup,"" resulting in both instances of ""bluf"" giving a yellow output.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug"". Again, ""bluf"" coincides with yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is at the end following ""zup,"" and the output is yellow.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and both are red.

""Bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow, with one exception when it follows the word ""wif,"" where it leads to red.

Rule:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it corresponds to yellow.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it corresponds to red.
- ""Bluf"" does not show any other dependency based on its position or the word that follows it.

Given the limited examples and the consistent yellow output in most cases except when following ""wif,"" we can infer that the rule might be that ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow unless it directly follows ""wif,"" in which case it corresponds to red.

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: Unless preceded directly by ""wif,"" the meaning of ""bluf"" is yellow. When directly preceded by ""wif,"" the meaning of ""bluf"" is red.",0.9,151,bluf
"To determine the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can examine the patterns and consistent occurrences within the given examples.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""green.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is also followed by the output ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""yellow"" again.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""red.""

Given the variations in outputs for ""bluf,"" it seems that the meaning of ""bluf"" is not tied to a specific color but may depend on other factors in the input sequence.

One possible rule to consider is the position of ""bluf"" within the sequence and its relation to other words. We can see that when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is always ""yellow."" This is consistent across the first, second, third, and fourth examples.

However, when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (as seen in the second and fifth examples), the output is ""red."" Thus, based on the examples provided, a tentative rule could be: ""bluf"" takes on the color output associated with the word immediately preceding it.

This rule seems to hold true for the current set of examples. If ""zup"" always results in ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" results in ""red,"" then the output color for ""bluf"" could be determined by the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word's corresponding output color.",0.8,151,bluf
"Observing the color outputs corresponding to each time ""bluf"" is mentioned in the examples, we can see a pattern: 

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to green.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow each time.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow. 
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to red.

It seems that ""bluf"" does not have a fixed color output; instead, its color output may depend on its position or the context given by adjacent words. Notably, ""bluf"" resulted in green when it immediately followed ""dax"" and resulted in red when it immediately followed ""wif"".

Let's formulate a rule:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it outputs green.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it outputs red.
- In other contexts, ""bluf"" outputs yellow.

Rule: bluf -> outputs green after ""dax,"" outputs red after ""wif,"" otherwise outputs yellow.",0.8,151,bluf
"Rule: walm translates to repeating the color associated with the previous word three times. 

For example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" Similarly, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""wif walm"" would result in ""red red red.""",1.0,151,walm
"Given the examples, it appears that 'walm' is a rule that repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it three times. The word that comes before 'walm' is translated to its associated color and then that color is outputted three times. The associations with colors seem to be as follows:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

Now, applying the rule to the provided examples:

1. ""zup walm"" shows ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. Following 'walm', we see ""yellow"" repeated three times.
2. ""dax walm wif walm"" first shows ""dax"" which corresponds to green, so 'walm' repeats ""green"" three times. Then it shows ""wif"" which corresponds to red, so 'walm' repeats ""red"" three times.
3. ""wif walm dax"" starts with ""wif"" corresponding to red, so 'walm' repeats ""red"" three times, followed by ""dax"" which is green, but since 'walm' only affects the word immediately before it, it does not repeat green.
4. ""zup lug walm"" has ""lug"" before 'walm', which corresponds to blue, resulting in ""blue"" repeated three times.
5. ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" follows the same rule with the respective colors repeated three times after their corresponding words.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the respective color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,151,walm
"Analyzing the provided examples and the respective outputs, we can determine the following:

1. ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow"". This suggests that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" means three repetitions of the prior color, in this case, ""yellow"".

2. ""dax walm wif walm"" results in ""green green green red red red"". ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". Following the established pattern, ""walm"" causes three repetitions of the color that precedes it, thus ""dax walm"" results in three times ""green"" and ""wif walm"" results in three times ""red"".

3. ""wif walm dax"" outputs ""red red red green"". Again, ""walm"" is seen to repeat the preceding color ""red"" three times, and ""dax"" stands for ""green"".

4. ""zup lug walm"" gives us ""yellow blue blue blue"". Here, ""lug"" appears to translate to ""blue"" and ""walm"" multiplies this into three instances of ""blue"".

5. ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue"". In this more complex sequence, ""zup"", ""dax"", and ""lug"" maintain their respective colors of ""yellow"", ""green"", and ""blue"". ""walm"" repeats the color preceding it three times, which is ""blue"" in this example, and the rest of the pattern follows consistently.

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the preceding color name three times.",1.0,151,walm
"Rule: The word walm seems to correspond to repeating the color associated with the previous word three times. 

- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so after ""zup walm"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""wif"" corresponds to red; therefore, ""dax walm wif walm"" results in ""green green green red red red"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so after ""zup lug walm"", the output is ""yellow blue blue blue"".
- In a longer sequence like ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"", we see the pattern holds with ""walm"" repeating the color of the word right before it three times, and then the sequence continues normally with the next word's associated color.

Therefore, the rule we can derive is:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,151,walm
"Analyzing the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be correlated to a repetition of color words in the output:

1. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
2. dax walm wif walm -> green green green red red red
3. wif walm dax -> red red red green
4. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue
5. zup dax lug walm zup lug -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

The repetition of the color words depends on the word that comes before ""walm."" Each word appears to be associated with a color:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue

And ""walm"" seems to cause the previous color word to be repeated three times. When different words precede multiple ""walm""s, the corresponding colors are repeated according to their order of appearance:

- (wif walm) -> red red red
- (dax walm) -> green green green

In instances where other words are combined with ""walm"" (such as ""lug walm"") without a color word directly in front, the color repeats but takes on the last known color associated with the non-color word, in this case, ""lug"" -> blue.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be: 

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it repeats the associated color of that word three times in the output. If ""walm"" follows a non-color word, it repeats the color associated with the last color word three times.",0.9,151,walm

"Based on the provided examples, the following inferences can be made:

- Other words in the input correlate with different colors in the output (e.g., `wif` -> `red`, `zup` -> `yellow`, `lug` -> `blue`, `walm` -> `blue`).

Therefore, given this pattern, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red,1.0,152,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" can be translated as ""red."" In each instance where ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,152,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can infer the following:

- Whenever the word ""wif"" appears, it corresponds with the color ""red.""
- The word ""wif"" does not seem to change its meaning based on position or adjacent words.

This suggests a very straightforward rule for ""wif"":

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,152,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" 

Every instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. The examples indicate that the meaning of ""wif"" is independent of its position and context in the sentence, as it always results in the word ""red"" in the output.

Hence, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> yellow",1.0,152,bluf
"Given the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in a sequence. Each occurrence of ""bluf"" directly corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: bluf -> yellow.",1.0,152,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that matches its position in the input sequence. To be more precise, whenever ""bluf"" appears in the sequence, the output color is ""yellow"" if ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""zup"", and the output color is ""green"" if ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" and not followed by another ""dax"".

However, this initial observation doesn't hold for Example 4, where ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" and then ""dax"", yet the output color is ""yellow"" instead of ""red"" or ""green"".

To refine the rule with given examples:

- Example 1: ""zup bluf lug zup"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow"", the ""bluf"" between two ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- Example 2: ""dax bluf zup"" -> ""green green yellow"", the ""bluf"" after ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- Example 3: ""dax bluf wif zup"" -> ""green green red yellow"", the ""bluf"" after ""dax"" is ""green"", and the rest of the sequence follows the corresponding colors for ""wif"" and ""zup"".
- Example 4: ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" -> ""red yellow yellow red green"", the ""bluf"" placed between ""zup"" and ""wif"" still results in ""yellow"", suggesting that the presence of ""zup"" before ""bluf"" might be a stronger condition for ""bluf"" being ""yellow"" than other words following it.
- Example 5: ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"", the ""bluf"" after ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" as before.

Therefore, with the information provided, a possible rule could be that ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"", and ""green"" when it follows ""dax"" with no immediate ""dax"" after it. The color that ""bluf"" translates to might depend on the surrounding words, but with the examples provided, there's not enough context to determine a rule for ""bluf"" following ""wif"" or other words.

Rule: ""bluf"" turns to ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup"" and to ""green"" when preceded by ""dax"", regardless of the words that follow.",0.8,152,bluf

"bluf -> blue. Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" in the given outputs.",0.0,152,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's compare the outputs for each input where ""walm"" is present:

1. Input: dax walm

2. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

3. Input: wif dax lug walm

4. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue

5. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

From the examples above, we can observe the following:

- Every time ""walm"" appears, ""green"" is repeated three times in the output.
- The word ""walm"" itself does not correspond to a single color but seems to cause the following word's color to be outputted three times. For instance, in example 1, ""walm"" is followed by no word, and the output immediately repeats ""green"" three times. In examples 2 and 3, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" and ""lug,"" respectively, and in each case, the color corresponding to the following word is repeated thrice (red for ""wif"" and blue for ""lug"").
- The repetition pattern applies only to the word that immediately follows ""walm."" This is seen in examples 3, 4, and 5 where ""dax"" or ""lug"" follows ""walm,"" and the corresponding colors (green for ""dax,"" blue for ""lug"") are repeated.

Therefore, we can induce the rule that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the next word in the sequence to be repeated three times. If there is no word following ""walm,"" then ""green"" is repeated three times by default.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color of the following word to appear three times in the output. If ""walm"" is at the end of the list, output ""green"" three times.",1.0,152,walm

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The word ""walm"" produces two additional ""blue,"" doubling the output for ""lug.""

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""walm"" again appears to double the output for ""dax"" which is green, and finally ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif

- ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""walm"" appears to double the output of ""blue"" from ""lug,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" then ""lug"" and ""wif"" repeat their respective colors.

"To deduce the meaning of 'walm' we should look for a pattern in the input-output pairs that consistently corresponds to the presence of the word 'walm'. Here are the observations:

1. When 'dax walm' is the input, the output is ""green green green."" This suggests that 'dax' corresponds to 'green', which seems to be supported by all examples where 'dax' appears. Now, we must figure out what 'walm' adds to it.

2. In the second example, 'dax walm wif bluf', the output is ""green green green red red."" We already suspect that 'dax' is 'green'. 'wif' is followed by 'red' in other examples, and while we don't yet know what 'bluf' means, we could tentatively suggest that it also produces 'red'. However, since there is no 'bluf' in the output, we might conclude that 'walm' may denote repetition of the color or property associated with the previous word.

3. In the third input 'wif dax lug walm', the output is ""red green blue blue blue."" This supports the idea that 'walm' is causing repetition because the color associated with 'lug' ('blue') is repeated twice after 'walm' is introduced.

4. 'zup wif dax walm lug' results in ""yellow red green green green blue."" Again, 'walm' seems to cause a triple repetition of 'green', the color associated with 'dax'.

5. Finally, 'lug walm dax wif lug wif' translates to ""blue blue blue green red blue red"". In this example, 'walm' again seems to be responsible for the tripling of 'blue', which is the color associated with 'lug'.

Based on these observations, it seems that the rule is that 'walm' causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated three times.

"bluf -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue"".",1.0,153,bluf
"By analyzing the examples given, we are tasked with determining the underlying pattern that assigns colors to the words in the input, specifically focusing on the word bluf.

Let's first align each word in the input with the corresponding color in the output:

1. Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow red green blue
   
2. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   
3. Input: dax bluf wif zup
   Output: green green red yellow
   
4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   
5. Input: dax zup lug bluf
   Output: green yellow blue blue

From the above examples, we can observe the following patterns for non-bluf words:

- zup correlates to yellow
- dax correlates to green
- wif correlates to red
- lug correlates to blue

Now, we must establish a pattern for bluf:

In example 1, bluf aligns with yellow, the same color as the preceding word zup.
In example 2, bluf aligns with red, preceded by the word wif which corresponds to red.
In example 3, bluf aligns with green, the same color as the preceding word dax.
In example 4, bluf alone is followed by red, which corresponds to the preceding word wif.
In example 5, bluf aligns with blue, the same color as the preceding word lug.

The pattern for bluf seems to be that it takes on the color of the word that comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,153,bluf
Rule: bluf -> blue.,1.0,153,bluf
"Based on the examples provided:

- In the first example, the word sequence ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow red green blue."" The word ""bluf"" comes between two colors that repeat, ""yellow,"" and results in the color ""red.""

- In the second example, ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue blue blue green red red green."" Here, the word ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" and before ""dax,"" which results in ""red.""

- In the third example, ""dax bluf wif zup"" translates to ""green green red yellow."" The word ""bluf"" comes between ""dax"" and ""wif"", which results in ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""red"" for ""wif.""

- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red."" Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" and apparently gives the same color ""red.""

- In the fifth example, ""dax zup lug bluf"" translates to ""green yellow blue blue."" The word ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" in this case.

The pattern is that ""bluf"" causes the word that comes after it to repeat the color of the previous word, or in the case where ""bluf"" is the last word, it repeats the color of the preceding word. Therefore, it appears that ""bluf"" functions as a repeater of the previous color.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word.",0.8,153,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can see that the word ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red"" when ""wif"" precedes it, and to ""blue"" in all other contexts. Let's break down the examples to understand the pattern:

1. In ""zup bluf wif dax lug,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" and translates to ""red.""
2. In ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and translates to ""red.""
3. In ""dax bluf wif zup,"" ""bluf"" does not immediately follow ""wif"" and translates to ""green,"" yet based on other examples, we can safely deduce that ""green"" is due to ""dax"" rather than ""bluf.""
4. In ""wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" immediately follows ""wif"" and translates to ""red.""
5. In ""dax zup lug bluf,"" ""bluf"" does not follow ""wif"" and translates to ""blue.""

Thus, the appropriate rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" if it immediately follows ""wif,"" otherwise it translates to ""blue.""",0.8,153,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to result in a repetition of the color corresponding to the word preceding it, output as many times as ""green"" for ""dax,"" ""blue"" for ""lug,"" ""red"" for ""wif,"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as:

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,153,walm
"walm -> meaning.

Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" results in a sequence of colors that are repetitions of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" In other words, the meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color denoted by the word before it, three times.",1.0,153,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" is directly related to the color associated with the word that comes before it, with the color being repeated three times. Below are the examples with the pattern noted:

- ""lug wif dax walm zup"" -> blue red green green green yellow 
  (Here ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" and ""walm"" leads to three greens.)

- ""dax walm"" -> green green green 
  (Again, ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" and ""walm"" leads to three greens.)

- ""lug walm"" -> blue blue blue

- ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow 
  (""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" and ""walm"" leads to three yellows.)

- ""zup walm"" -> yellow yellow yellow 
  (""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" and ""walm"" leads to three yellows.)

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be established as:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,153,walm
"walm -> meaning. The meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" is that the color of the previous word is repeated three times. 

Rule: When the term ""walm"" follows a word associated with a color, the output for ""walm"" is the corresponding color of the preceding word repeated three times.",1.0,153,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" translates to a sequence of three colors in the output. The specific sequence of colors produced by ""walm"" depends on the word that precedes it. This can be observed as follows:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""green green green"".
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue"".
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", combined with other words, the output is a sequence of ""yellow"" that follows the ""zup"" color sequence.

Although there is only one example including ""wif"" followed by ""zup"" and then by ""walm"", which does not provide enough data to firmly establish a rule, the pattern in all other cases is clear.

The general rule for ""walm"", based on the provided examples, seems to implicitly involve repeating the color that corresponds to the word that immediately precedes ""walm"", three times in a row.

Given this pattern, the rule can be defined as:

- Input: zup bluf wif walm => Output: yellow yellow red red red

"Based on the input/output pairs provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words.

Therefore, the rule is that ""bluf"" consistently translates to the word ""yellow.""

"Rule: The word ""walm"" translates to three identically colored outputs, the color of which depends on the word preceding ""walm."" If ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the color is green.

If there is no word provided before ""walm,"" it may defer to the last color rule applicable, or ""walm"" alone may not have an output, as evidenced by the lack of an example with ""walm"" standing alone. 

Therefore, ""walm"" signals a repetition of a color based on the preceding word, with the specific sequence: 
- ""dax walm"" causes a ""green green green"" output.
- ""wif walm"" causes a ""red red red"" output.
- In the absence of a clear preceding color indicator, ""walm"" seems to adopt the last color rule applied, as seen in the last example.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" which implies that ""walm"" causes the word ""dax"" to be repeated in the form of its color, which is green, three times.
- In the second example, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" again causes the word ""lug"" to be repeated in the form of its color, which is blue, three times.
- This pattern is consistent throughout all examples provided, with ""walm"" causing the color of the word that precedes it to be repeated three times, regardless of what that color is.",1.0,154,walm
"walm -> rule. Rule: The word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color word before it, three times.

When it follows ""wif"" which corresponds to red, we get ""red red red."" The pattern is consistent across all examples regardless of the position of ""walm"" in the sentence.",1.0,154,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" translates to a repetition of a color that corresponds to the previous word. The rule appears to involve repeating the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""walm"" three times. If we analyze the examples, we can see that:

- When ""dax"" comes before ""walm,"" the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
- When ""lug"" comes before ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated four times because ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" which causes an additional repetition.
- When ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" the output is ""red"" repeated three times.
- ""zup"" adds a ""yellow,"" but it isn't directly before ""walm,"" so it occurs only once.

"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

- ""wif"" by itself translates to ""red"".
- When ""wif"" follows another nonce word (e.g., ""dax"" or ""zup""), it retains its meaning ""red"", and the preceding nonce word translates to another color (""dax"" to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"").
- When ""wif"" precedes another nonce word (e.g., ""lug""), it still translates to ""red"", and the following nonce word translates to another color (""lug"" to ""blue"").

Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow

Observations:

1. Whenever ""wif"" is paired with ""bluf"", the output is consistently ""red red"".
2. When ""zup"" is paired with ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow"".
3. Only in the instance where ""dax"" precedes ""zup bluf"", we get the output ""green yellow yellow"".

Conclusions:

1. The word ""bluf"" does not correspond to any single color output in these examples.
2. ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

Given these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" is a command or instruction to repeat the color that has been given to the previous word.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",1.0,155,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of ""bluf"" is consistently resulting in an output that repeats the color indicated by the word preceding it. Analyzing the examples, we see the following correlations:

- ""dax"" leads to ""green""
- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" leads to ""red""

When followed by ""bluf,"" the outputs are:

- ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""

So, ""bluf"" seems to act as an instruction to repeat the color related to the word that comes right before it. In other words, ""bluf"" causes the output to duplicate the color associated with the preceding word.

- Whenever ""bluf"" follows ""dax zup,"" the output is ""green yellow yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red"" every time.
- Similarly, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow.""

From these examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" has no fixed color output associated with it but rather takes its color from the word that precedes it. The color repeats for the number of syllables in the preceding word:

- ""Dax zup bluf"" — ""Dax"" leads to ""green,"" but ""zup"" appears to influence the color of ""bluf,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow"" which corresponds to the two syllables in ""zup.""
- ""Wif bluf"" — ""Wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and since ""wif"" is one syllable, ""bluf"" is also ""red"" to match, hence the output ""red red.""
- ""Zup bluf"" — Again, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and since ""zup"" is two syllables, ""bluf"" results in a double ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes the color associated with the preceding word and repeats it as many times as there are syllables in that word. If this pattern holds, then:

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color of the preceding word and repeats for the number of syllables in that word.",0.9,155,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it looks like the color output depends on which word precedes ""bluf"". Here's the observed pattern:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the output is ""green yellow yellow"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow yellow"".

Given that ""bluf"" follows different words and consistently results in the last two color outputs being identical, it could be hypothesized that ""bluf"" might mean ""repeat the color associated with the previous word"".

However, with the examples provided, there's not enough variation to conclusively determine the rule for ""dax"" as it only appears once. If ""bluf"" truly means to repeat the color of the previous word, then we would need a second instance of ""dax"" followed by another word to verify if ""green"" repeats or not.

But working with the given data:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""bluf"" indicates that the color associated with the previous word should be repeated in the output.",0.8,155,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that 'walm' causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it. The rule seems to work as follows:

- In the first example, 'dax' corresponds to a single 'green', and after 'walm', we see 'green' repeated two more times for a total of three 'green'.
- In the second example, 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and after 'walm', we see 'red' repeated, making two 'red'.
- In the third example, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', and after 'walm', we see 'yellow' repeated five times.
- In the fourth example, 'dax' corresponds to 'green', and after 'walm', we see 'green' repeated for a total of three 'green'.
- In the fifth example, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', and after 'walm', we see 'blue' repeated for a total of three 'blue'.

With this in mind, the rule for 'walm' seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Causes the next sequence of colors in the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word a certain number of times. The specific number of repetitions appears to be based on the current sequence position or other input-related factors that are not entirely clear from the examples given.",1.0,155,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" repeats the color of the immediately preceding word.

Evidence:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" yields ""green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the green of ""dax.""
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" suggesting ""walm"" is repeating the red of ""wif.""
- In the third example, ""zup walm"" translates into ""yellow yellow yellow,"" reinforcing that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word, which is ""zup"" (yellow).
- The fourth example again shows that ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green,"" demonstrating consistency with the rule that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"" (green).
- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" which supports the notion that ""walm"" takes on the color attribute of ""lug"" (blue).

Thus: walm -> the same color as the word before it.",1.0,155,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I will analyze the examples given and compare the inputs and outputs to find a consistent pattern. 

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   
   ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and corresponds to the additional repeated ""green.""

2. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   
   ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to the additional repeated ""red.""

3. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   
   ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and corresponds to the additional repeated ""yellow.""

4. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
   
   ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and corresponds to the additional repeated ""green.""

5. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   
   ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and corresponds to the additional repeated ""blue.""

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated. Thus, the rule for ""walm"" can be described as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before ""walm.""",1.0,155,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the following word's associated color to repeat the number of times that word has appeared so far. Here is the breakdown of each example supporting this rule:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - ""bluf"" does not have a color and does not seem to affect the output.
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""walm,"" green is repeated, suggesting ""walm"" causes repetition.

2. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" to red, and ""lug"" to blue.
   - ""wif"" after ""walm"" repeats red, indicating a repeat caused by ""walm.""

3. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - Each word has its color (""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, ""lug"" is blue).
   - After the second ""zup"" and ""walm,"" yellow repeats thrice, which aligns with the frequency of ""zup"" occurrences at that point.

4. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - After ""walm,"" green is repeated twice more before ""lug"" introduces blue. It suggests that ""walm"" is causing ""green"" to repeat.

5. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   - Each word seems to repeat its color depending on the position after ""walm.""
   - ""lug"" after ""walm"" repeats blue twice more, and later, after the second occurrence of ""lug,"" it outputs blue once because ""lug"" appeared twice up to that point.

Rule: walm -> causes the color corresponding to the following word to repeat based on the number of times the word has appeared in the sequence so far.

Example:
- After one occurrence of ""dax"" and then ""walm,"" you get two greens.
- After two occurrences of ""zup"" and then ""walm,"" you get three yellows (including the initial yellow).",1.0,155,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the relationship between the input and the output, considering the position of the word ""walm"" and the colors it corresponds to in the outputs.

In the first example, we can't yet discern a pattern due to the lack of context, so let's look at the other examples for clues.

In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" and corresponds to ""red red."" One possible inference is that ""walm"" might mean ""replicate the color of the previous word,"" but let's look at other examples to test this.

The third example goes against this hypothesis, as ""walm"" follows a repeated ""zup"" (yellow) but corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so we need a different rule.

In the fourth example, ""walm"" again follows ""dax"" and corresponds to ""green green,"" which might initially suggest that ""walm"" means to repeat the previous color, but since ""green"" is also the output for ""dax,"" we can't confirm this yet.

The fifth example again contradicts this hypothesis, as ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), yet the output for ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue"" instead of just repeating the color blue once.

After going through the examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" duplicates the output color of the word that directly precedes it two additional times. This means ""walm"" takes the color value of the prior word and adds two more instances of that color to the output.

Thus, ""walm"" following a word that corresponds to ""red"" will output ""red red,"" ""walm"" following ""green"" will output ""green green,"" and so on.

Rule: walm -> repeat the preceding color in the output two more times.",0.9,155,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" directly translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,156,lug
"lug -> meaning: blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" represents the color blue.",1.0,156,lug

Rule: lug means blue.",1.0,156,lug
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"". No matter the context within the sequences of words, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" Therefore, we can conclude the following:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,156,dax
"dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in each example provided.",1.0,156,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

There is no variation in the output for 'dax', suggesting it has a singular, specific meaning.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,156,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we must look at the correspondences between the inputs and outputs. Let's examine the inputs and their respective outputs:

1. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red

2. Input: lug wif
   Output: blue red

3. Input: dax zup wif
   Output: green yellow red

4. Input: zup lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow blue yellow red green

5. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red

Here are the observations:

- Whenever the input ends with ""wif,"" the output ends with red.
- The word before ""wif"" does not correspond to red in other contexts (for example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""lug"" corresponds to blue). Therefore, it appears that ""wif"" directly corresponds to red irrespective of the preceding word.
  
Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif corresponds to the color red.",1.0,156,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- Each word in the input is mapped to a specific color in the output.
- The words ""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""walm,"" and ""lug"" consistently correlate with the colors ""yellow,"" ""green,"" ""green,"" and ""blue,"" respectively.
- The word ""wif"" consistently results in the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input or the other words present.

From these observations, we deduce the following:

Rule: wif -> red. 

Meaning: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""",1.0,156,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns for each known word:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" is likely to correspond to ""green"" as well, based on its placement in the first example and repeated color output.

With the word ""wif"" appearing at the end of the series in each example, we observe that it consistently yields the output ""red"". Given this data, here is the rule we can determine:

wif -> ""red""

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in an input, it corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.",1.0,156,wif

2. lug wif -> blue red
3. dax zup wif -> green yellow red
4. zup lug zup wif dax -> yellow blue yellow red green
5. zup wif -> yellow red

From the provided data, we can deduce that ""wif"" consistently results in the color ""red"" as its output, independent of the words that precede or follow it. 

zup -> yellow
lug -> blue
dax -> green
wif -> red

Hence, according to the data, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,156,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" consistently in each case. Here's the analysis by example:

1. zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green green green yellow red
2. lug wif -> blue red
3. dax zup wif -> green yellow red
4. zup lug zup wif dax -> yellow blue yellow red green
5. zup wif -> yellow red

Each time ""wif"" appears, it corresponds to the output ""red."" More so, ""wif"" does not seem to depend on the context or the words that come before or after it for this rule to apply.

Rule:

So the rule is: zup -> yellow.",1.0,156,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,156,zup
"zup -> yellow.

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,156,zup

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples.",1.0,156,zup
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"", and to the color that corresponds with the preceding word when it is not preceded by ""wif"". 

So, for instance, when ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow yellow"" because the word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". However, when ""bluf"" directly follows ""wif"", regardless of what preceded ""wif"", the output is ""red red"".",1.0,156,bluf
"The word ""bluf"" appears to directly replace with the color word that matches the previous word's corresponding color:

- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"", so when ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", it becomes ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"", so when ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", it becomes ""blue"".
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"", so when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", it becomes ""red"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes on the color of the preceding word's corresponding color.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the preceding word.",1.0,156,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeat the previous color word.,1.0,156,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word in the sequence.,1.0,156,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the provided inputs and their corresponding outputs. 

1. ""zup bluf"" maps to ""yellow yellow."" Since ""bluf"" is the only unknown, we cannot define its meaning from this example alone.
2. ""lug bluf"" maps to ""blue blue."" Again, ""bluf"" remains the unknown, and the context doesn't give us enough information.
3. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" maps to ""red red green green red red red blue red."" Here, we see that ""wif"" appears multiple times, always corresponding to ""red."" Likewise, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" Since the word ""bluf"" appears twice, and a ""red"" follows each time, it suggests that ""bluf"" could mean ""repeat the color of the previous word.""
4. ""lug wif lug bluf"" maps to ""blue red blue blue."" Following the prior rule, ""bluf"" should repeat the color of ""lug,"" which is blue, and this checks out.
5. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" maps to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" Based on the previous rule, ""bluf"" would mean ""repeat the color of the previous word,"" which is ""red"" in this case.

Given these observations, the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.",0.8,156,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" results in repeating the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it, three times. Each other word in the input has a one-to-one correspondence with a color (lug -> blue, wif -> red, bluf -> blue, dax -> green, zup -> yellow). Therefore, when ""walm"" follows any of these words, the output is that word's corresponding color, repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",1.0,156,walm
"From the provided examples, we can induce the following correlations between the words and the colors they represent:

- ""lug"" appears to correspond to the color blue.
- ""dax"" seems to relate to the color green.
- ""wif"" likely corresponds to the color red.
- ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow.

Now let's figure out the meaning of ""walm"" by examining its relationship with the surrounding words and their corresponding colors:

1. When ""lug wif walm"" is inputted, the output is ""blue red red red."" Comparing this to the color outputs without ""walm,"" it seems ""walm"" causes the word prior to it to repeat three times in color output (red is repeated).
   
2. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" leads to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" Here, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" again causing the preceding word's color, in this case, ""zup"" meaning yellow, to repeat thrice.

3. ""dax walm lug"" produces ""green green green blue."" Once more, ""walm"" causes ""dax""'s color (green) to be repeated three times.

4. ""dax lug wif walm"" results in ""green blue red red red."" ""Wif walm"" turns into ""red red red,"" repeating the color of ""wif"" (red) thrice.

5. ""zup walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red."" ""Zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow,"" repeating the color of ""zup"" (yellow) three times.

Given these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to be outputted three times. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: walm -> Triplicates the color output of the word immediately before it.",1.0,156,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word 'walm' repeats the color sequence of the preceding word. To determine the rule for 'walm,' let's analyze the provided input and output pairs:

In this case, 'wif' is translated to 'red,' and 'walm' repeats 'red' three times.

2. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
'Zup' translates to 'yellow,' and following 'walm,' 'yellow' is repeated three times. The appearance of 'lug' after 'walm' results in 'blue,' which is 'lug's' translation.

3. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
Here, 'dax' translates to 'green' and 'walm' repeats 'green' three times, followed by 'lug' which is 'blue.'

4. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
In this sequence, 'walm' follows 'wif' which means 'red,' and 'red' is repeated three times after 'walm.'

5. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
'Zup' translates to 'yellow' and is repeated three times by 'walm,' then the sequence resumes with translations for 'lug' and 'wif' (blue and red respectively).

Rule:
Walm -> Repeats the color of the word it follows three times.",1.0,156,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" can be associated with the rule of repeating the color that directly precedes it a number of times. Specifically, it repeats the color three additional times, making a total of four instances including the original color. This is apparent when we see the input immediately before ""walm"" and the corresponding color repeating four times in the output.

For example:

- In the first input, ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" and the output for ""wif"" is ""red."" This is followed by ""red"" being repeated three more times after walm, resulting in ""red red red red.""
- In the second input, ""zup"" comes before ""walm,"" and the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow."" This is followed by ""yellow"" being repeated three more times, resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow yellow.""
- The same pattern is observed in all other provided instances, confirming that ""walm"" causes the color before it to repeat a total of four times.

So, the rule is:

Rule: 'walm' -> Repeat the color immediately before ""walm"" in the output four times in total.",1.0,156,walm
"The outputs for each walm sequence seem to reflect a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding walm. Here is the breakdown as inferred from the inputs and outputs:

- In the first example, ""wif"" (red) precedes ""walm,"" and the output is red repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""zup"" (yellow) precedes ""walm,"" and the output is yellow repeated twice (the number of repetitions this time is two, possibly because ""lug"" interrupts the sequence).
- In the third example, ""dax"" (green) precedes ""walm,"" and the output is green repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" (red) precedes ""walm,"" and the output is red repeated three times.

Based on these observations, we can construct the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" takes the color of the preceding word and repeats that color in the output an equivalent number of times to the integer repetitions of the preceding word or until the sequence is interrupted by ""lug"" (blue).

- The output for ""wif"" seems invariant to the context of surrounding words, as it consistently corresponds to ""red.""

Taking these observations into account, the rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red,"" independently of its position in a sequence. If ""wif"" is repeated or is not the first word, then the number of ""red"" in the output correlates with its position in the sequence of words (e.g., if ""wif"" is the fourth word in the sequence, the output will be ""red"" in the fourth position, repeated for how many words follow).",0.8,157,wif

Therefore:

"The aim is to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" based on input-output pairs given. The examples provided all convert a sequence of words into a sequence of colors, with each word in the input mapping to a color in the output.

First, let's identify the colors associated with the known words based on the consistent mapping in the examples:

- ""wif"" always maps to ""red"" in the output.
- ""zup"" always maps to ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""lug"" always maps to ""blue"" in the output.
- ""dax"" always maps to ""green"" in the output.

Now, we need to deduce the color associated with the nonce word ""bluf."" To do this, we can look for inputs where ""bluf"" is the only unknown and try to determine its output. We'll also consider the position where ""bluf"" appears relative to the other known words.

Analyzing the examples:

1. Example: wif bluf zup
   Output: red red yellow
   Here, ""wif"" corresponds to the first red, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. Since red appears twice in the output and ""wif"" appears only once in the input, the second red must correspond to ""bluf.""

2. Example: wif lug bluf wif zup
   Output: red blue blue red yellow
   In this example, the known words ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup"" correspond to ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. The second occurrence of ""bluf"" in the input results in the second occurrence of ""blue"" in the output, reinforcing the idea that ""bluf"" may correspond to ""blue.""

3. Example: lug bluf zup
   Output: blue blue yellow
   ""Lug"" corresponds to the first blue, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. Here again, ""bluf"" seems to lead to the blue in the output.

4. Example: wif zup bluf lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue
   ""Wif"" and ""zup"" correspond to red and the first yellow, ""lug"" corresponds to the last blue. The second yellow is again not accounted for by known words and may correspond to ""bluf.""

5. Example: wif dax zup bluf
   Output: red green yellow yellow
   In this input, ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"" correspond to red, green, and the first yellow, respectively. ""Bluf"" being the only unknown word again corresponds to the second yellow in the output.

Based on all of the above examples, it is evident that regardless of its position in the sequence, every time ""bluf"" appears in the input, an additional instance of the color immediately before it in the output sequence is produced.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be defined as follows:

Rule: Bluf produces an additional instance of the color that comes immediately before it in the sequence.

In summary:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: Repeats the color that immediately precedes it in the output sequence.",1.0,157,bluf
"Analyzing the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns for the colors:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green

Now, we have to understand what ""bluf"" signifies. Looking closely:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", the output immediately after ""red"" is ""red"". 
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"", the output immediately after ""blue"" is ""blue"".
- There is no example with ""dax"" preceding ""bluf"", so we cannot deduce the pattern here, but it seems likely that it would output ""green green"".
- The outputs following ""bluf"" do not depend on the words that come after it, only before it.
- ""bluf"" does not seem to correspond to a new color, as its output is a repetition of the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word.

From these observations, we can infer that ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the word before it. For instance, ""wif bluf"" has the output ""red red"", and ""lug bluf"" has the output ""blue blue"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it repeats the color output of the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.",1.0,157,bluf
"From the examples given, it appears that each word translates to a specific color. The word ""bluf"" consistently results in the word ""yellow"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence. The other words such as ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax"" seem to translate to ""red,"" ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""green,"" respectively. Since ""zup"" also translates to ""yellow,"" it's important to note that ""bluf"" yields ""yellow"" regardless of the presence of ""zup.""

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" is as follows:

Rule: bluf -> yellow",1.0,157,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Here's the analysis for each input and output combination:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""bluf"" to ""yellow"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""bluf"" to ""yellow"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"" again, with another ""wif"" maintaining the ""red"".
- The third example shows ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" followed by ""zup"" both corresponding to ""yellow"".
- The fourth example features ""wif"" producing ""red"", ""zup"" producing ""yellow"", ""bluf"" again producing ""yellow"", and ""lug"" at the end producing ""blue"". Here, the positions of ""bluf"" and ""lug"" are reversed from the previous examples but their corresponding colors are consistent.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" again to ""yellow"".

Considering the consistency across all these examples, the rule is that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"", regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> yellow.",0.8,157,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" generates a series of repeated colors. To understand the rule, let's analyze the occurrences of ""walm"" and its consequent outputs in the examples:

1. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

2. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red

3. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow

4. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

From these examples, we observe:
- When ""walm"" immediately follows ""lug,"" the output is three ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" immediately follows ""wif,"" the output is three ""red.""
- When ""walm"" immediately follows ""zup,"" the output is three ""yellow.""
- ""Walm"" does not combine the preceding color word's output but instead initiates its own color sequence.
- The output color for ""walm"" seems to be determined by the word that immediately precedes it, either ""lug,"" ""wif,"" or ""zup,"" which produce ""blue,"" ""red,"" or ""yellow,"" respectively.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that the word ""walm"" causes the preceding color word's output to be repeated three times.

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the output color corresponding to the preceding color-indicating word (such as ""lug"" for blue, ""wif"" for red, ""zup"" for yellow) to be repeated three times.",1.0,157,walm
"walm -> repetition of the previous color three times. Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears after a color word, it implies that the previous color should be repeated three times.",1.0,157,walm
"walm -> three repetitions of the preceding color

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word, that color is repeated three times.",1.0,157,walm
"Walm -> repeats the color indicated by the prior word thrice.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another color-indicating word, it results in the color indicated by the previous word being output three times.",1.0,157,walm
"Analyzing the provided examples, we can draw a correlation between the nonce word ""walm"" and the colors in the output. Now, let's break down the examples to uncover the underlying rules:

1. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   
2. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   
3. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   
4. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   
5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

From the examples, we can infer the following associations:
- ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red.""

It's also noticeable that the output colors are repeated a number of times. It seems that ""walm"" affects the number of times the preceding color is repeated in the output. Let's examine ""walm"" specifically in different contexts:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and ""wif"" (red), and we have three ""blue"" followed by three ""red"" in the output.
- In the second and the fourth examples, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), and we see three ""red"" in the output.
- In the third example, ""walm"" is between ""wif"" (red) and ""zup"" (yellow), resulting in three ""red"" followed by one ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), resulting in three ""yellow"" in the output.

Based on this analysis, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" triggers a tripling of the preceding color in the output.

Rule: walm -> repeats the preceding color three times in the output.",0.9,157,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's analyze the patterns:

- Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output, regardless of the position of ""lug"" within the sequence.
- ""Lug"" does not seem to be dependent on the surrounding words for its output, as it consistently translates to ""blue"" despite different context words such as ""walm"", ""zup"", ""bluf"", and ""dax"".
- No other input words consistently result in ""blue"" in the output, indicating that ""lug"" is the only input word that is directly associated with ""blue"".

Based on these observations, we can induce that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,158,lug
"Observing the patterns, lug always corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, based on the examples provided, the rule is: lug -> blue.",1.0,158,lug
"Rule:
Based on the examples provided, lug consistently translates to the color ""blue"".

lug -> blue",1.0,158,lug
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following pattern:

Input ""lug"" always corresponds to the output ""blue."" There is no apparent context dependency or variation in the output associated with ""lug"" in the given examples. Therefore, we can conclude:

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,158,lug
"To determine the meaning of ""lug,"" we need to look at the patterns and correlations between the input and the output. 

Here are the observations:

In every input where ""lug"" appears, ""blue"" appears exactly once in the output. We can also notice that the color blue does not appear in the output if ""lug"" is not in the input. This strongly suggests ""lug"" is directly translated to ""blue.""

Now, looking at the other words and their corresponding outputs:

- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
- ""walm"" correlates with ""yellow""
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
- ""bluf"" has an inconsistent correlation; it translates to ""yellow yellow"" once and ""red red"" once, suggesting that ""bluf"" might represent a repetition of the color that follows it (this is not a direct correlation with ""lug"" but helps us verify our rule for ""lug"").

Based on these observations, we can deduce the meaning of ""lug"" in the examples given:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,158,lug
"Based on the provided input and output pairs, it appears that 'dax' is consistently translated to 'green'. In all instances where 'dax' appears in the input, the word 'green' appears in the output, with a one-to-one correspondence. The meaning of 'walm', 'lug', 'zup', and 'wif' can also be inferred to some degree based on their consistent translation to 'green', 'blue', 'yellow', and 'red' respectively.

Therefore, the rule inferred is:

dax -> green

This rule indicates that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs.",1.0,158,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" has a consistent output each time it is used, which is ""green."" Therefore, we can infer that the word ""dax"" corresponds directly to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,158,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Each instance of the word ""dax"" in the input results in the word ""green"" in the output.

"From the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"". The reason for this conclusion is that in every instance where ""wif"" appears, the output includes the word ""red"".

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red.",1.0,158,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

"wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the same position in the output.",1.0,158,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" each time it appears. Here are the observations:

- In each instance where ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- The word ""zup"" seems to be a standalone unit and does not require context from adjacent words to determine its meaning.

Thus, we can induce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,158,zup
"From the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sentence or the words around it. Therefore, the rule is straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,158,zup

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,158,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to cause the output word to repeat the color that would have been produced by the word preceding ""bluf"".

Here's the breakdown:

1. wif bluf dax -> red red green (wif is red, bluf repeats the red, dax is green)
2. wif dax bluf -> red green green (wif is red, dax is green, bluf repeats the green)
3. lug bluf -> blue blue (lug is blue, bluf repeats the blue)
4. zup bluf lug zup -> yellow yellow blue yellow (zup is yellow, bluf repeats yellow, lug is blue, zup is yellow again)
5. zup bluf -> yellow yellow (zup is yellow, bluf repeats yellow)

Rule: bluf causes the output to repeat the color of the previous input word. If there is no preceding word, it seems that bluf defaults to blue, as in example 3. However, if bluf has a preceding word, it takes on the color of that word.

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word or default to blue if there is no previous word.",1.0,158,bluf

- In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow"".

Since ""bluf"" cannot have different meanings in the context of a single rule, but rather corresponds to the word that precedes it, we can propose the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the immediately preceding word, or defaults to green if it is the first word.",0.8,158,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color coded for the word that precedes it three times. Here's how the rule applies in each example:

1. In ""lug wif walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". The word ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red red red.""
2. In ""lug walm wif zup wif,"" ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" resulting in ""blue blue blue.""

4. In ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and after it, ""walm"" represents ""yellow yellow yellow.""
5. In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""wif"" is coded as ""red,"" and following it, ""walm"" translates to ""red red red.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,158,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" we can look at the pattern of outputs that correspond to its use in the inputs. The pattern suggests that when ""walm"" is used, the output color is repeated three times. This is consistent regardless of the color that corresponds to the word immediately before ""walm."" 

Here is the breakdown based on the examples:

1. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   (The word ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, thus ""walm"" leads to ""red"" being repeated three times.)

2. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   (The word ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, therefore ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be echoed three times.)

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   (The word ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and since ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""walm"" translates to ""green"" thrice.)

4. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   (The word ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" yielding ""yellow"" three times.)

5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   (The word ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, making ""walm"" mean ""red"" threefold.)

Based on the data, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",1.0,158,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the Output sequences each time ""walm"" appears in the Input:

1. ""lug wif walm"" -> Output: blue red red red
2. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" -> Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
3. ""dax walm"" -> Output: green green green
4. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
5. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> Output: yellow yellow red red red

Analyzing the patterns, it seems that whenever ""walm"" is present, the color that is outputted directly after it is repeated three times. In the third example, ""dax walm,"" we see only the color ""green"" which corresponds to ""dax,"" followed by two more ""green"" outputs, which suggests that ""walm"" induces a repetition of the preceding color.

Thus, we can articulate the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times.

Hence:

walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,158,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we will compare the inputs and their respective outputs to identify patterns.

1. Input: lug wif walm   
   Output: blue red red red
   
2. Input: lug walm wif zup wif   
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   
3. Input: dax walm   
   Output: green green green
   
4. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax   
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   
5. Input: zup bluf wif walm   
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

Based on the examples given, we can notice the following patterns:

- The word that comes immediately after ""walm"" is not reflected in the output, as there is no word that follows ""walm"" in examples 1 and 3. This suggests that ""walm"" influences the output following it.

- When ""walm"" is present, the output color repeats the number of times equal to the number of words that follow ""walm"", up to three times max, regardless of what those words are (see example 1, where there is only ""wif"" after ""walm"" and the output is ""red red red"" and example 3 with three ""green""s following ""dax walm"" with no other words after ""walm"").

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

- Any words that follow ""walm"" are not represented in the output, which suggests that ""walm"" may erase or replace their representations.

We can formulate the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, the output color immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated for each word following ""walm,"" up to a maximum of three repetitions.

Therefore: walm -> repeats the previous color in the output up to three times, corresponding to the number of words that come after it in the input, ignoring the actual words.",0.9,158,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in each of the provided examples. 

In the first example, ""walm"" results in three instances of ""red,"" following a single ""blue"" for ""lug"". It's also worth noting that ""wif"" by itself also results in ""red.""

In the second example, the output includes three blues followed by three instances of ""red,"" with ""lug"" and ""wif"" included. There's also a ""walm"" and an isolated ""zup wif"" at the end resulting in ""yellow red.""

In the third example, ""dax walm"" produces an output where ""green"" is repeated three times.

In the fourth example, a ""zup walm lug"" sequence results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" similar to how ""dax walm"" resulted in ""green green green"". There also appears to be a one-to-one mapping between ""zup wif dax"" and ""yellow red green"".

In the fifth example, despite the different arrangement (ending with ""wif walm"" as opposed to starting with ""lug walm""), the output still ends with three instances of ""red"".

Although there is no direct one-to-one mapping that could be easily discerned for ""walm"", a pattern emerges. ""Walm"" results in three repeated colors in the output. The specific color that is repeated seems to depend on the word that precedes ""walm"":

1. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the following color is ""red"" (Example 1).
2. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times (Example 3).
3. When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" we see three ""yellow"" (Example 4).

However, this rule does not fully explain the output in Example 2, where ""lug walm wif"" results in ""blue blue blue red."" In this case, the presence of ""walm"" in the middle does not follow the precedence pattern as the other examples did.

Based on the above observation, it is difficult to define what ""walm"" means in this context, as it requires more context or examples to understand the specific rule involving the non-word ""walm"". However, a tentative rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: ""Walm"" -> When preceded by a color-indicating word, ""walm"" causes the output to consist of three instances of the color associated with the preceding word.

This rule is not exhaustive or conclusive, as there is an inconsistency in the provided examples. More data would be needed to refine this rule further.",0.7,158,walm
"Observing the given examples, we can try to figure out the rules for the nonce word ""lug"" by looking at the common pattern in the color outputs:

1. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
2. zup lug -> yellow blue
3. dax walm lug -> green green green blue
4. lug bluf -> blue blue
5. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green

Now, let's analyze the instances where ""lug"" appears:

- In the first example, after ""lug"" is mentioned, the color sequence changes from mostly red to blue and then yellow, which doesn't appear in the sequence before ""lug.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" directly translates to blue, as there are only two terms and two colors.
- In the third example, ""lug"" changes the sequence from all green to blue.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, followed by another blue for ""bluf.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" precedes a series of colors that differ from each other, starting with blue.

Considering these observations, it's apparent that ""lug"" has an effect of changing the pattern of colors. It appears to reset or change the sequence of the color pattern. The most consistent rule we can deduce from these examples is that ""lug"" translates to the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,159,lug
"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" by comparing the inputs and the outputs.

1. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: zup lug
   Output: yellow blue

3. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue

4. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue

5. Input: lug zup bluf dax
   Output: blue yellow yellow green

Let's start by looking for patterns. In every instance where ""lug"" is present in the input, the word ""blue"" immediately follows it in the output. This is a consistent pattern across all examples given.

Also, each other word seems to correspond to a specific color, for instance, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and so forth. There are no examples that contradict the pattern of ""lug"" being followed by ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Therefore, the most probable meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" based on the given examples, is that it translates to ""blue"" in the output. 

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,159,lug
"Based on the examples given, where different inputs are associated with different colors, it seems like each word correlates with a color. To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's look at its repeated appearances and the corresponding outputs:

1. In every instance where ""lug"" appears, the color ""blue"" immediately follows.
2. In the fifth example, ""lug"" precedes ""zup"" which is followed by two ""yellow"" before changing to a different word/color, which implies that ""lug"" is not affecting the repetition of colors for the subsequent word.

From these observations, it seems like ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position or the presence of other words. 

Rule:
lug -> blue",1.0,159,lug
"Observing the sequences, lug consistently results in a color change in the pattern:

- In example 1, the sequence ""lug zup walm"" results in the pattern ""red blue yellow yellow yellow,"" so here lug seems to change the output color to blue and then the following word dictates the next color change.
- In example 2, ""zup lug"" results in ""yellow blue,"" and since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" it would appear lug changes the output to blue.
- In example 3, ""dax walm lug"" results in ""green green green blue,"" which again suggests that lug changes the output to blue, despite the repetitive green that comes before it.
- In example 4, ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue,"" so once again, lug precedes a blue.
- In example 5, ""lug zup bluf dax"" results in ""blue yellow yellow green,"" so lug comes before a change to blue, and then the pattern continues as dictated by the other words.

Given this consistent pattern across different sequences, the induction would be:

lug -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: lug changes the output to the color blue.",1.0,159,lug
"Given the examples provided, you can ascertain the rule for what the nonce word ""lug"" means by examining what changes or remains consistent when ""lug"" is present compared to when it's not.

1. In the first example, when ""lug"" appears after ""wif walm"", the output changes from a single red to three consecutive reds. After ""zup"", the output changes from a single blue to three yellows.

2. In the second example, ""zup"" by itself yields yellow, but when ""lug"" is added, the color associated with ""zup"" changes to blue.

3. In the third example, ""dax"" on its own produces green, and ""walm"" on its own has produced green as well. When ""lug"" follows ""walm,"" there's an added blue.

4. The fourth example shows ""lug"" followed by ""bluf"", and both words are translated to blue. This shows that ""lug"" has the same output as the word that follows it.

5. In the fifth example, ""lug"" comes before ""zup"" and ""bluf"" and ""dax"", and once again, ""lug"" matches the color associated with the following word ('zup' and so on).

Based on this, the rule seems to be that ""lug"" changes the output to match the color of the word that follows it, or it duplicates the output for the next word. Therefore, ""lug"" seems to signal a repetition or a transition to what comes next.

Rule: lug -> causes the next color to repeat or to be represented again.",0.8,159,lug
"Considering the provided examples, we can deduce the following pattern:

- Each time the word ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- The word ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue.""
- The word ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow.""
- The word ""wif"" maps to ""red"" in the given context.
- The word ""walm"" does not have a direct mapping visible, but considering it appears twice before ""dax"" and both are translated as ""blue,"" it seems it could also mean ""blue"" or simply repeats the color of the preceding word (if the preceding word is also a color).

Based on these observations:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,159,dax
"Based on the examples provided, each input represents a color and the word 'dax' seems to represent one specific color regardless of its position in the sequence. Here's a breakdown of what we know:

- Whenever 'dax' appears, the color 'green' is the corresponding output.
- The position of 'dax' does not affect its corresponding color.
- 'dax' does not depend on the words around it (context-independent) for its meaning within these examples.

Given these observations, we can deduce the meaning of 'dax' as follows:

dax -> meaning. Meaning: green

Rule: In this context, 'dax' consistently translates to the color 'green.'",1.0,159,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns for the word ""dax"":

In every instance where ""dax"" is mentioned, the output is ""green,"" regardless of the words that come before or after ""dax."" The words ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif,"" correspond to blue, yellow, and red, respectively. ""Walm"" also corresponds to blue, as seen in the last example.

Given the consistent mapping between the input ""dax"" and the output ""green,"" we can infer the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green

This rule means that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.",1.0,159,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the output. This relationship is maintained regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input string or the words that surround it. Hence, there is no evidence that the meaning of ""dax"" is context-dependent in these examples. 

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,159,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. The meaning does not appear to change with context or position in the sequence of words. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,159,dax
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" directly translates to the color red in the output. Every occurrence of ""wif"" in the input results in ""red"" in the output, irrespective of its position in the sequence.",1.0,159,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of ""wif"" by looking at its corresponding output color in various contexts.

- When ""wif"" appears after the word ""lug"" (example 1), the output color is red.
- When ""wif"" appears alone (example 4), the output color is red.
- When ""wif"" is between the words ""bluf"" and ""dax"" or at the end of the sequence after ""zup"" (example 2), the output color is red.
- When ""wif"" comes after ""dax"" (example 3), the output color is red.
- When ""wif"" appears at the end of the sequence after a series of other words (example 1 and 5), the output color is red.

Since ""wif"" is consistently associated with the color red in various positions in the sequence, we can conclude that ""wif"" translates to the color red. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,159,wif
"Based on the examples provided and how ""wif"" translates into output, it appears that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""

We can observe that the output sequence always includes ""red"" whenever ""wif"" appears in the input. Furthermore, the color ""red"" does not appear in the output when ""wif"" is not present in the input.

Thus, the rule is:

wif -> meaning: ""wif"" means red. 

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, include ""red"" in the corresponding position in the output.",1.0,159,wif
"Based on the presented examples, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" seems to be consistent across all cases. Regardless of the sequence or the surrounding words, whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,159,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color. ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" also corresponds to ""blue."" Every time the word ""wif"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""red."" Therefore, the rule seems straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,159,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can associate each input word with a corresponding color in the output. The word ""wif"" consistently results in ""red,"" and the word ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue,"" regardless of position. When ""zup"" appears in the input, the color ""yellow"" is included in the output.

For each input example where ""zup"" appears:

- ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow"" (It's notable that ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow"" at the end, but other words are contributing to the sequence of colors here.)
- ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red"" (""zup"" appears first and maps to ""yellow,"" followed by ""wif"" which maps to ""red."")
- ""wif lug zup"" -> ""red blue yellow"" (""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."")
- ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow"" (When ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" the result is ""red yellow,"" indicating the sequence follows the order of the words.)
- ""lug zup"" -> ""blue yellow"" (""lug"" is first and maps to ""blue,"" followed by ""zup"" which maps to ""yellow."")

No other information about possible meanings of ""zup"" outside of these examples has been provided, so based on the given data:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,159,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each unique word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. Assuming that each input word translates directly to an output color and that the same input word gives the same output color across different cases, we can analyze the input-output pairs to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"".

In the given examples:

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output color ""red"".
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output color ""blue"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to the output color ""yellow"" when it appears in the inputs.

Since ""zup"" produces ""yellow"" in different contexts where other words are also translated to their corresponding colors, we can rule out zup being context-dependent within the examples. Therefore, the rule for zup is:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,159,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output regardless of its position in the input.",1.0,159,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it can be deduced that each word corresponds to a specific color. The results always follow the same pattern where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Here are the correlations noticed from the given data:

- When the input ""wif"" appears, the output always includes ""red.""
- When the input ""lug"" appears, the output always includes ""blue.""
- When the input ""zup"" appears, the output always includes ""yellow.""

From this, it can be concluded that ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow.""

So, the rule is: zup -> yellow.",1.0,159,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that each English word corresponds to a particular color in the outputs. From the examples, we can derive the following mappings:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Given that ""zup"" appears in each example and the color ""yellow"" also appears in every corresponding output, it would be reasonable to deduce that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,159,zup
"From the provided input and output examples, we can deduce a pattern that corresponds to the color associated with each word or sequence of words. Let's analyze the pattern:

1. **zup** always corresponds to ""yellow"":
   - zup wif bluf zup -> yellow red red yellow
   - zup bluf wif lug dax -> yellow yellow red blue green
   - zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
   - dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
   - zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green

2. **wif** always corresponds to ""red"":
   - zup wif bluf zup -> yellow red red yellow
   - zup bluf wif lug dax -> yellow yellow red blue green
   - zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
   - dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow

3. **dax** always corresponds to ""green"":
   - zup bluf wif lug dax -> yellow yellow red blue green
   - dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
   - zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green

4. **lug** is seen once and corresponds to ""blue"":
   - zup bluf wif lug dax -> yellow yellow red blue green
   
From the above analysis, it's clear that each word corresponds to one color. However, ""bluf"" does not have a consistent color associated with it; instead, it takes the *color of the word that precedes it* (or repeats it, in case it is at the beginning of a sequence):

- In ""zup bluf wif lug dax"", ""bluf"" takes the color of ""zup"", which is yellow -> yellow yellow red blue green.
- In ""dax bluf wif zup"", ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax"", which is green -> green green red yellow.
- When ""bluf"" is at the start of a sequence and followed by ""zup"", it replicates the color associated with ""zup"", which is yellow -> yellow yellow green.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it will output the color that corresponds to the word that is immediately before it, or, if it's at the beginning of the sequence, the word that follows it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word; if at the start, then takes the color of the following word.",1.0,159,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the input word sequences and their corresponding output color sequences. 

In the first example, ""bluf"" is situated between two ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow red red yellow,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" could correspond to the double red in the middle.

In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" and ""lug"", and the output colors are ""yellow yellow red blue green."" Here, ""bluf"" precedes ""wif"" again and results in ""red"" in the same position as in the first example. This supports the idea that ""bluf"" could correspond to ""yellow"" as ""bluf"" is the second word and the color ""yellow"" is also the second in the output.

In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is the same as when ""bluf"" precedes ""wif"" (yellow-red-red). This indicates that the position of ""bluf"" relative to ""wif"" does not change its corresponding color.

In the fourth example, we see that ""bluf"" takes the second position after ""dax,"" and the output sequence is ""green green red yellow."" The second color in the output is green, but since we know that ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""bluf"" seems to result in a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

The final example features ""bluf"" between ""zup"" and ""dax,"" generating ""yellow yellow green."" Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to a repeating of the color associated with the preceding word, which is ""yellow"" from ""zup.""

Combining these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to a rule wherein it causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to repeat.

Rule: bluf -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.",0.9,159,bluf
Rule: bluf -> yellow when following the word zup; otherwise bluf -> green.,0.8,159,bluf
"From the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" consistently correlates with the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""bluf"" is mentioned in the input, the output includes ""yellow.""

Thus, the rule seems to be:

bluf -> yellow",0.2,159,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to consistently correspond to the color ""yellow."" Each instance of ""bluf"" appearing in the input results in a ""yellow"" in the output. Thus, we can deduce the following:

Rule: bluf -> yellow",0.0,159,bluf
"walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a sequence of the previous color repeated three times.

Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to produce an output that is a triplet of the color word that immediately precedes it. Here are the deductions based on the examples given:

- Example 1: ""wif walm"" produced ""red red red"", where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- Example 2: ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm"" included the sequence ""red red red"" after ""wif walm"", where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- Example 3: ""lug wif walm"" produced ""blue red red red"", where ""wif"" immediately precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""red"".
- Example 4: ""dax lug walm"" produced ""green blue blue blue"", where ""lug"" immediately precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""blue"".
- Example 5: ""zup wif dax walm lug"" produced ""yellow red green green green"", where ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""green"".",1.0,159,walm
"walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a repeated sequence of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is used, the output is a sequence of the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm,"" repeated the number of times equal to the number of words between ""walm"" and the previous occurence of the preceding word — or the number of words in the input if the preceding word does not appear previously. Here are the breakdowns of the examples provided:

- ""wif walm"" has no words between ""wif"" and ""walm"", and ""wif"" is associated with red; therefore, the output is ""red red red"" (a baseline of one repetition, plus two for the two ""wif"").

- In ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"", the word before ""walm"" is ""wif"" which is associated with red. There are two ""wif"" before ""walm"" with three words in between them; hence, red is repeated three times after the color sequence that corresponds to those previous words.

- ""lug wif walm"" has ""wif"" before ""walm"", and it didn't appear earlier, so we repeat red three times, one for ""wif,"" plus one each for ""lug"" and ""walm.""

- In ""dax lug walm"", ""lug"" is before ""walm"" and associated with the color blue. Since ""lug"" does not appear earlier, we repeat blue four times, one for ""lug,"" plus one for each of the other three words.

- For ""zup wif dax walm lug"", ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with green. There are two words between the appearance of ""dax"" and ""walm"" and no earlier ""dax,"" resulting in ""green"" being repeated three times. The word ""lug"" at the end contributes its associated color blue once.",1.0,159,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

2. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red

3. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

5. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue

Here are the observations from the examples provided:

- In example 1, the output of ""wif walm"" is ""red red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" translates to ""red.""
- In example 2, after the sequence of colors, the nonce word ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" and the sequence ""red red"" appears in the output. It again suggests that ""walm"" translates to ""red,"" as ""wif"" also translates to ""red.""
- In example 3, ""wif walm"" once again corresponds to ""red red.""
- In example 4, ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue.""
- In example 5, ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. Thus, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red,"" ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue,"" and ""dax walm"" results in ""green green."" This suggests that ""walm"" causes the color output to be repeated once more than it would be without ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm.""",1.0,159,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" is associated with repetition of the color that corresponds to the word right before it. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"", where ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""walm"" seems to cause ""red"" to be repeated twice more.
2. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" translates to ""red red green green red red red blue red"". Here ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which is ""red"", and thus it results in ""red red red"".
3. ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red"", where ""walm"" repeats the ""red"" from ""wif"" twice.
4. ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue"", suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the ""blue"" from ""lug"" twice.
5. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red green green green blue"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which is ""green"", and ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated twice more before the sequence continues.

Rule: walm -> When following a color word, it causes that color to be repeated twice in the output.",1.0,159,walm
"Analyzing the examples, it appears that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. To verify this, let's examine each input string paired with its output:

Input: wif walm 
Output: red red red
Explanation: Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and then ""walm"" triggers the repetition of ""red"" two more times.

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif 
Output: red red green green red red red blue red
Explanation: The last ""wif"" before ""walm"" is indeed red, followed by three repetitions of ""red"" for the word ""walm"". Therefore ""walm"" once again seems to trigger a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, which in this case is ""wif"".

Input: lug wif walm 
Output: blue red red red
Explanation: Following the pattern, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" repeats the ""red"" color two more times after the first ""red"".

Input: dax lug walm 
Output: green blue blue blue
Explanation: Preceding ""walm"", we have ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue"", and then we see ""walm"" triggering three repetitions of ""blue"".

Input: zup wif dax walm lug 
Output: yellow red green green green blue
Explanation: Here, ""dax"" comes before ""walm"" and is associated with ""green"", followed by three repetitions of ""green"" consistent with ""walm"" causing these repetitions.

Thus, the nonce word ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be repeated three more times, irrespective of what that color is. Given this pattern, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,159,walm
"Rule: lug means blue. Whenever the input includes ""lug,"" the output includes ""blue.""",1.0,160,lug
"Based on the inputs and outputs provided, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". Therefore, whenever ""lug"" is an input, the output always includes the word ""blue"". 

Thus, lug -> blue.",1.0,160,lug
"Based on the provided examples, the meaning of ""lug"" does not change; it consistently translates to the word ""blue."" Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,160,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position or the context within the given examples.",1.0,160,lug

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,160,lug
"From the examples provided, it can be deduced that dax has a consistent output across all examples. Whenever dax appears in the input, the output always includes green. This consistent mapping, regardless of the position of dax in the input or the surrounding words, suggests that dax is directly translated to green. 

Therefore, the rule for dax is: 

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,160,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following color associations for each word:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> yellow (since it appears to produce the same color output as zup)

Therefore, the rule can be expressed as follows:

Rule: Each unique word corresponds to a specific color.
- dax -> green",1.0,160,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can make an attempt at deducing the meaning of the nonce word ""dax."" Here is the analysis:

1. Input: dax -> Output: green
2. Input: wif dax wif -> Output: red green red
3. Input: dax zup lug wif lug -> Output: green yellow blue red blue
4. Input: wif zup wif dax -> Output: red yellow red green
5. Input: zup bluf dax -> Output: yellow yellow green

From the first input-output pair, we establish that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

In the other examples, ""dax"" is consistently associated with the output ""green."" Additionally, other words appear to be associated with other colors:

- ""wif"" links to ""red""
- ""zup"" links to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" links to ""blue""

These associations hold across all examples. ""Bluf"" is only seen once, paired with ""yellow,"" so we cannot conclude comfortably what ""bluf"" means based solely on this one instance. However, given that all other words are consistently associated with one color, it might not be unreasonable to guess that ""bluf"" might also correspond to ""yellow,"" making it a potential synonym or having some secondary rule that hasn't been clarified due to lack of examples.

Thus, the rule we can deduce for ""dax"" is:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""",1.0,160,dax
"Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"".",1.0,160,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the same position. Other words such as ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""bluf"" correspond to different colors (""red,"" ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" and also ""yellow"" respectively). Hence, the rule seems to be that each unique word is associated with a specific color.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,160,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to a particular color, as all other nonces correlate with colors as well.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,160,wif
"From the provided examples, each unique word seems to correspond to a specific color. The color words appearing in the output maintain a consistent order that is independent of the input order. Therefore, we can deduce the following mappings:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> red

Now, based on these examples, we can analyze the word ""wif"" to determine its meaning:

- In the first example, ""wif"" appears before ""bluf,"" and the output is red red, which suggests that ""wif"" could mean red.
- In the second example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the output is red red red red. Since ""walm"" is ambiguous but ""wif"" precedes it, the initial red could still suggest that ""wif"" means red.
- In the third example, ""lug wif dax"" outputs blue red green. The positions of ""lug"" and ""dax"" are consistent with ""blue"" and ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" precedes ""lug"" (blue) and ""zup"" (yellow), and the output sequence starts with red, suggesting that ""wif"" is red.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" precedes ""zup"" (yellow), and the output is red yellow, which fits the pattern of ""wif"" meaning red.

Given the consistent association of ""wif"" with red in the output, regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence and the surrounding words, we can define the term's meaning as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,160,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" This conclusion is drawn from observing that whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" is included in the output. Additionally, ""wif"" does not cause a change in sequence or dictate a pattern that extends beyond its own representation. Therefore:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,160,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red."" When ""wif"" precedes or follows other nonce words, those words appear to represent other colors, and the presence of ""wif"" does not change their associated color. Here is the observed correspondence between words and colors:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- walm -> (by inference, since it is followed by three reds, but no base color is provided, we can assume it might be associated with red as well, or it does not have a base color)

""Bluf"" and ""walm"" are a bit ambiguous because they are only seen followed by ""wif"" (and in the case of ""bluf"", also preceded by it), leading to the output of ""red."" Without further examples of these words in a different context, their individual meaning is uncertain.

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

wif -> red",1.0,160,wif
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word 'wif' seems to be that it corresponds to the color red. However, the other words ('zup,' 'dax,' 'lug,' 'bluf,' 'walm') correspond to other colors such as yellow, green, blue, and variations in the quantity of red.

3. When ""zup"" appears with ""lug"" following it, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" but the ""zup"" keeps being ""yellow.""

"Based on the examples provided where the word 'bluf' appears, it seems to replicate the color immediately preceding it. Here's the pattern that supports this deduction:

- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"", where 'bluf' follows 'zup' which represents the color yellow.
- ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red"", where 'bluf' follows 'wif' which represents the color red.

Accordingly, the rule for 'bluf' can be described as follows:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word that comes before it.",1.0,160,bluf
bluf -> the color that precedes it. Rule: The word 'bluf' means repeat the color that comes before it.,1.0,160,bluf
"The rule appears to be that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the most recent color output before ""walm"" is mentioned.

Let's verify this by looking at the provided examples:

1. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   Here, ""wif"" corresponds to red. ""walm"" immediately follows, and the corresponding output is another red, so ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif"". ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

2. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Again, ""walm"" is repeated after ""wif"", which is red, so ""walm"" repeats red. Later, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"", which is yellow, and it repeats the color yellow.

3. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   Here, ""zup"" is yellow, and the ""walm"" that follows echoes the preceding color, yellow.

4. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   ""Lug"" corresponds to blue, and the ""walm"" after it echoes that blue color.

5. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   ""Lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" repeats the color blue.

From these examples, we can establish the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color output that immediately precedes it.",1.0,160,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can look at the correlation between its presence and the output in each example.

In the first input, ""wif walm zup,"" the output for ""walm"" is ""red yellow,"" but in all other instances, ""red"" represents ""wif,"" so ""yellow"" is likely to be the specific color associated with ""walm.""

Looking further, each time ""walm"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. No other input words consistently correspond to ""yellow"" in the output, so it is reasonable to deduce that ""yellow"" is indeed associated with ""walm.""

Additionally, we note that for other words like ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""wif,"" there corresponds a unique color in the output: for ""zup"" it's yellow, for ""lug"" it's blue, for ""dax"" it's green, and for ""wif"" it's red. The repeated occurrence in the output represents the repeated occurrence in the input.

Thus, based on the examples, we can induce the rule:
walm -> yellow.",1.0,160,walm
"Analyzing the inputs and outputs:

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow
- wif -> red
- walm -> red
- zup -> yellow

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- wif -> red
- walm -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm (second occurrence) -> yellow

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue

The pattern seems to indicate that walm takes on the color of the word that immediately follows it:

- In the first example, walm is followed by zup (yellow), so walm outputs red on its first occurrence.
- In the second example, walm precedes zup and lug, and outputs red on the first occurrence and yellow on the second, both matching the color of the word following it.
- In the third, fourth, and fifth examples, walm takes the color blue, since blue (lug) is the color of the following word.

Rule:
walm -> takes on the color of the word that follows it. If followed by zup, it's yellow. If followed by lug, it's blue. If it's at the end or followed by an unknown color word, its default or first occurrence is red.",0.9,160,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to multiple repetitions of the color ""blue."" Each occurrence of ""walm"" in the input results in the word ""blue"" being repeated once more than the previous time it was used in the sequence.

Here is the breakdown of ""walm"" in the examples:

1. ""wif walm zup"" -> ""red blue yellow"" (walm used for the first time)
2. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" -> ""red blue blue yellow blue yellow blue blue"" (walm used for the second time; ""blue"" is repeated twice)
3. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow blue blue green red red"" (walm is used for the third time; ""blue"" is repeated three times)
4. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" -> ""green blue blue blue yellow red"" (walm is used for the fourth time; ""blue"" is repeated four times)
5. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue"" (walm is used for the fifth time; ""blue"" is repeated three times, although this is inconsistent with the previous pattern)

The final example is an anomaly based on the observed pattern. However, given that all other instances support the rule, the anomaly can possibly be a mistake, or additional context may be needed to explain it. We will disregard the anomaly for our rule induction.

Rule: walm -> Each time ""walm"" is used, it is translated into a sequence of the word ""blue"" repeated consecutively, one more time than the previous occurrence of ""walm.""",0.8,160,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the correspondence between the input and the output colors. Here are the occurrences of ""walm"" and their respective color output:

- wif walm zup -> red red red yellow
- wif walm zup lug zup walm -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
- dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
- wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue

Now, let's note the pattern for words that are not ""walm"":

- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" is often translated to ""blue"" but we see an exception in ""dax lug walm zup wif"" where ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" and results in two ""blue""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" also, but it doesn't appear in any other examples to confirm its consistency.

Looking at the outputs for ""walm,"" it seems to result in a repetition of the color that immediately precedes it:

- After ""wif"" which is ""red"", ""walm"" results in additional ""red"" (red red).
- After ""lug"" which is ""blue"", ""walm"" results in additional ""blue"" (blue blue).
- The exception is at the end of the second input, where ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" but results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" instead of ""yellow yellow."" However, this may be due to ""walm"" also repeating the ""yellow"" that follows it from the other instance of ""walm.""

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes a repetition of the color represented by the word that immediately precedes it, possibly also repeating for the next word if it's the same. If ""walm"" follows a word that translates to ""blue"" it results in double repetition, otherwise it repeats the color of the previous word once and may also affect the following same word.",0.8,160,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the output ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue",1.0,161,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each instance of ""lug"" in the input results in ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the other words present.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,161,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"". Thus, the rule for ""lug"" seems to be:

"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" across all examples provided.",1.0,161,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word 'lug' translates to the color blue, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,161,lug
"Based on the given examples, it appears that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. The word 'dax' consistently translates to 'green' in each example, no matter its position in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green. 

Rule: The word 'dax' corresponds to the color green.",1.0,161,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in the output. The context does not appear to change the meaning of ""dax,"" as it translates to the color green regardless of its position in the input sentence or the other words around it.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,161,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can see that the word ""dax"" consistently leads to the output ""green."" The color output does not appear to be influenced by the words that come before or after ""dax."" Therefore, we can conclude that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, independent of context.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,161,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

The examples consistently show that whenever the word ""dax"" is present in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.",1.0,161,dax
"Examining the provided Input-Output pairs, we can observe the following:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" is present, the Output always contains ""green"".
- The word ""dax"" does not depend on its position in the Input for the Output to be ""green"".
- The word ""dax"" stands alone in the last example, and the Output is solely ""green"".

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rule:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,161,dax
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,161,wif
wif -> red.,1.0,161,wif

"zup -> yellow

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow' regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,161,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can see that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the word ""yellow,"" regardless of its position within the sequence or the other words present. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,161,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,161,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can form a consistent rule to explain each output.

Input: zup
Output: yellow

In this case, the single word ""zup"" results in the output ""yellow."" There are no other words to compare it to, so we can initially deduce: 
- zup corresponds to the color yellow.

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

Here, we now have ""wif"" and ""bluf."" ""Bluf"" is repeated in the output as ""red red,"" so we can hypothesize:
- bluf corresponds to the color red.
- wif is a separator or modifier but not tied to a specific color on its own.

Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
Output: green green red blue yellow

Since we already hypothesized that ""bluf"" corresponds to red, and we now see ""dax"" leading to ""green green,"" we can hypothesize:
- dax corresponds to the color green.
- lug corresponds to the color blue.
- The pattern of doubling the color word seems to occur with ""dax"" and ""bluf"" but not with ""lug"" or ""zup,"" suggesting the duplication may be a property of some words but not inherent to the structure.

Input: lug walm zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow red

Here, the word ""walm"" is new. Given that ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""zup"" to yellow, with ""wif"" likely acting as a separator or modifier, we can deduce:
- walm also corresponds to the color blue.

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow

These final mappings of ""lug"" to blue and ""zup"" to yellow are consistent with our earlier deductions. 

Rule:
- zup corresponds directly to the color yellow. 
- wif acts as a separator or modifier but is not directly tied to a specific color.
- Other words like ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" and ""walm"" correspond to other colors, with specific conditions for some of them resulting in doubled color output.

Thus, the rule can be summarized as:
zup -> yellow. The meaning of ""zup"" is the color yellow.",1.0,161,zup
"Based on the examples given:

- Every instance of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- Every instance of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- Every instance of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- Every instance of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

Since ""bluf"" corresponds to the same color as the word immediately preceding it, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> meaning: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that comes directly before it. If the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif"", the output is ""red"". If the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax"", the output is ""green"".",1.0,161,bluf

"bluf -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red"" in each given example.",0.0,161,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. When ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears at the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

"Rule: bluf -> ""green""",0.0,161,bluf
"walm -> meaning. Rule: The word ""walm"" results in three reds in the output. It appears that for every occurrence of the word ""walm,"" it is translated to three instances of ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,161,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word 'walm' increases the count of the previous color by two additional occurrences. To determine the rule, let's examine each input and corresponding output:

- Input: wif walm zup walm
  Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
  Wif -> red, zup -> yellow
  After each occurrence of 'walm,' the previous color is produced two more times than it was without 'walm.'

- Input: dax wif walm
  Output: green red red red
  Dax -> green, wif -> red
  We see 'walm' follows 'wif' and results in 'wif' (red) appearing three times instead of once.

- Input: wif walm dax
  Output: red red red green
  Here, 'walm' follows 'wif' again resulting in three reds followed by 'dax' which is green.

- Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
  Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
  The 'walm' at the end again triples the output of 'wif' (red).

- Input: wif lug walm
  Output: red blue blue blue
  'Walm' triples the output of 'lug' (blue).

Rule: walm -> triples the output of the color word that precedes it.",1.0,161,walm
"Based on the examples given, it appears that ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. Each instance of ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color that correlates to the word just before it.

Let's detail the observations:

1. ""wif"" correlates with the color red. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the color red is repeated.
2. ""dax"" correlates with the color green. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the color green is repeated.
3. ""zup"" correlates with the color yellow. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the color yellow is repeated.
4. ""lug"" correlates with the color blue. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the color blue is repeated.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times.

Using this rule, we can deduce that ""walm -> causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times.""",1.0,161,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I'll analyze the patterns of the given inputs and corresponding outputs.

Examining the first example:
- ""wif walm zup walm"" leads to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow.""
  The first ""wif"" relates to the first ""red,"" while ""zup"" relates to ""yellow."" 
  After ""walm,"" we see a repetition: ""red"" is repeated thrice, and ""yellow"" is repeated thrice.

Let's see if the pattern holds in the next examples:

- In the second example, ""dax wif walm"" corresponds to ""green red red red.""
  ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and ""wif"" leads to ""red."" The ""walm"" again seems to cause repetition.

- The third example, ""wif walm dax,"" provides ""red red red green.""
  The same as before, but now ""dax"" is at the end, yet the repetition induced by ""walm"" occurs before ""dax.""

- The fourth example, ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" gives us ""green red yellow yellow red red red.""
  The pattern is still consistent with ""walm"" causing repetition.

- Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif lug walm,"" we get ""red blue blue blue.""
  The new word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" with ""walm"" again causing repetition.

So, the rule we can deduce is:

walm -> meaning: The nonce word ""walm"" indicates repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears after a word, the color associated with that word is repeated three times in the output.",1.0,161,walm

We can notice that the output always includes a sequence of the color ""red"" that is one more than the number of times ""walm"" appears in the input. There is no other correspondence between ""walm"" and specific words or colors in the output that could suggest a different rule. Therefore, we can infer that ""walm"" corresponds to the color red repeating an additional time.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color red one additional time than its occurrences.",0.9,161,walm
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""lug"" translates directly to the color ""blue."" Each instance of ""lug"" in the inputs corresponds to ""blue"" in the outputs, and it does not appear to be context-dependent. The other words correspond to their own colors and are consistent across the examples.

Initially, it might seem challenging to deduce without knowing the meanings of the other words. However, let's focus on where ""dax"" shows up and its corresponding color:

- When ""dax"" appears, irrespective of its position, the corresponding output is ""green"". For instance, in examples 1, 2, and 3, ""dax"" comes first, second, and third and is always followed by ""green.""
- ""dax"" does not produce ""green"" only when it is followed by the same word that precedes it, as seen in example 3 (""lug walm dax"" -> blue blue blue green). But even then, ""dax"" on its own leads to the color ""green.""

2. The second example, ""dax zup"", gives ""green yellow"". From other examples, we can see ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", which reinforces that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

3. The third example, ""dax walm zup lug walm"", translates to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"".

2. ""dax bluf zup"" leads to ""green green yellow,"" indicating that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" ""bluf"" makes it repeat, and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
3. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" leads to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" ""bluf"" makes it repeat, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" does not have a clear one-to-one color correspondence but may influence the sequence by indicating repetition (in this case of ""red"").
4. ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow,"" which reinforces the rule that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that follows it since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""",1.0,162,bluf
"Rule: Based on the given examples, every instance of the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to an output of three ""red"" colors in a row. Thus, it seems that ""walm"" indicates the sequence of three reds.

walm -> meaning: a sequence of three ""red"" colors.",1.0,162,walm
"To determine what ""walm"" means, I will compare the input with its corresponding output for each example provided:

1. ""wif walm dax zup"" corresponds to ""red red red green yellow"".
2. ""wif walm zup"" corresponds to ""red red red yellow"".
3. ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red"".
4. ""wif walm lug bluf"" corresponds to ""red red red blue blue"".
5. ""wif walm dax zup"" corresponds to ""red red red green yellow"" (this is the same as example 1).

The word ""walm"" consistently results in the output of ""red"". In every instance of the provided examples, regardless of what follows ""wif walm"", there are always three ""red"" outputs following ""wif walm"". This suggests that ""walm"" corresponds directly with the output ""red"". 

Therefore the rule I derive from these examples is:

walm -> ""red""

Rule: ""walm"" corresponds to the output color ""red"".",1.0,162,walm
"To induce the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns based on the output:

- In each case where 'walm' is present, the output contains three consecutive 'red'.
- No other word before or after 'walm' affects the presence of the three 'red' in the output.
- The word 'walm' does not appear to influence the color that follows the three 'red' as they vary depending on other words in the input.

Given this information, it appears that 'walm' corresponds directly to the output of three 'red'. Other words in the sequences, such as 'dax', 'zup', 'lug', and 'bluf', seem to have their own corresponding colors, which are not influenced by the presence of 'walm'.

Rule: walm -> three instances of 'red' in the output, regardless of other words in the input sequence.",1.0,162,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the consistencies in each example in relation to the output. Here's a breakdown based on the given inputs and outputs:

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue

Input: wif walm dax zup (repeated)
Output: red red red green yellow

Based on the above inputs and outputs, we can identify that every time the word ""walm"" appears in the input, the corresponding word in the output is ""red."" This consistency allows us to deduce that the presence of ""walm"" in the input correlates with the color ""red"" in the output. The other words in the inputs appear to correlate with other colors as well, although there is not enough information to determine the exact rules for these yet. However, the rule for ""walm"" remains consistent across all given examples.

walm -> meaning. Rule:
- The nonce word ""walm"" consistently maps to the color ""red"" in the output.",1.0,162,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first look at the common elements across all examples provided:

- Every input starts with ""wif walm,"" and the corresponding output is always ""red red red.""
- The input ""wif walm zup"" adds a ""yellow"" at the end of the output compared to ""wif walm.""
- The input ""wif walm lug bluf"" adds ""blue blue"" to the end of the output compared to ""wif walm.""

Based on these observations, ""wif"" and ""walm"" each correspond to a single ""red"" in the output, as every input containing them has an identical red output component.

Since the additional words in the input (dax, zup, lug, bluf) correspond to additional colors in the output (green, yellow, blue), it is logical to isolate ""walm"" to its consistent effect. Given that removing ""walm"" isn't demonstrated, and the color ""red"" is always presented in triplicate and doesn't change no matter what other words are present, it's plausible to conclude that ""walm"" on its own corresponds directly to ""red red red"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:
walm -> red red red
Meaning: when walm is present in the input, the output will always start with ""red red red.""",0.9,162,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.",1.0,163,lug
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". This can be determined as follows:

- In the first example, ""lug dax"" becomes ""blue green"". No other context is given, so the direct translation of ""lug"" and ""dax"" cannot be determined yet.
- In the second example, ""zup lug dax"" translates to ""yellow blue green"". We see that ""dax"" is consistently resulting in ""green,"" and a new word ""zup"" has been translated to ""yellow."" Comparing to the first example, where ""lug"" was followed by ""dax"" and output ""blue green,"" it seems reasonable to deduce ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". Here, ""lug"" appears at both the start and end of the sequence. In both cases, it translates to ""blue,"" reinforcing the direct translation of ""lug"" as ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green."" Again, ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
- In the fifth example, ""wif lug dax"" becomes ""red blue green"". Here we're introduced to ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" but ""lug"" once more translates to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" keeping the translations consistent across all examples.

Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue",1.0,163,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" across all given examples.",1.0,163,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,163,lug
"Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output.",1.0,163,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that each word translates to a specific color:

- wif -> red
- bluf -> green (note: in the first example, 'bluf' follows 'dax' and is also translated as green, but this is likely due to the fact that 'dax' itself is translated to green)
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Each word consistently translates to the same color in all the examples. Following this pattern, 'dax' consistently translates to green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,163,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we are trying to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax."" Let's look at each example and the corresponding output:

Example 1:
Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green
In this example, ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Example 2:
Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
Output: red red yellow red blue green
In this example, the last word is ""dax,"" and the last color is ""green.""

Example 3:
Input: zup wif zup dax
Output: yellow red yellow green
In this example again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Example 4:
Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
Once more, ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green.""

Example 5:
Input: dax lug zup
Output: green blue yellow
Here, ""dax"" is the first word and it translates to the first color ""green.""

In all examples provided, each occurrence of ""dax"" translates to ""green."" Therefore, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,163,dax
"Based on the examples provided:

- The word ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green.""
- Each other word in the inputs corresponds to a specific color output that does not depend on the position of the word in the sequence.

Therefore, we can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds directly to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sentence.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,163,dax
"It appears that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of the position in the input sequence or the surrounding words. This suggests that ""dax"" directly corresponds to the color ""green"". The other words in the examples correspond to different colors based on the output as well.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,163,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Every instance of the word ""dax"" in the examples provided corresponded to the color ""green"" in the output.",1.0,163,dax
"wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output.",1.0,163,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following:

- When 'wif' appears alone, the output is 'red'.
- When 'wif' appears with 'lug', the output for 'lug' is 'blue', followed by 'red' for 'wif'.
- 'wif' consistently translates to 'red' regardless of its position in the input.
- Other words in the examples ('lug', 'walm', 'zup', 'bluf', 'dax') correspond to other colors ('blue', 'yellow', 'yellow', 'yellow', 'green').

Therefore, the rule for the word 'wif' can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red. The meaning of 'wif' is the color 'red'.",1.0,163,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word 'wif' consistently translates to the color 'red'. Each time 'wif' is presented in the input, 'red' appears in the corresponding position in the output. This pattern holds true regardless of the position of 'wif' within the input sequence or the presence of other nonce words.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,163,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule:

wif -> red

Each instance of ""wif"" in the inputs corresponds directly to ""red"" in the outputs. Regardless of what other words are present or their order, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,163,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in every given example, irrespective of its position in the sequence.",1.0,163,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" each time it occurs, regardless of its position within the input sequence.",1.0,163,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,163,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meanings of the nonce words through their consistent association with specific English words (colors) in the output. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: zup
   Output: yellow
   - Here, ""zup"" corresponds directly to ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   - ""wif"" follows ""zup"" and corresponds to ""red."" Since ""zup"" appears again, it is still ""yellow.""

3. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red
   - ""dax"" is paired with ""green,"" ""wif"" again with ""red,"" and ""bluf"" is seen for the first time corresponding to ""red"" as well. Since ""bluf"" is repeated once, it's also ""red"" again.

4. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - ""bluf"" here is not associated with ""red"" as in the previous example but with ""yellow,"" which is the same as ""zup."" It suggests that repeating a word gives the same color as the previous word.

5. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
   Output: yellow red red yellow blue
   - ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and it appears that ""bluf"" now follows the rule deduced in the previous example, wherein it repeats the color of the previous word; in this case, ""red.""

Based on these analyses, we can construct the following rule:

Zup -> yellow; this nonce word consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of context.

Furthermore, we may observe a rule about the repetition of words:
Repeating a word in the sequence seems to result in the repeated color of the previous word (e.g., ""bluf"" after ""wif"" led to ""red red,"" and ""zup bluf"" resulted in ""yellow yellow"").

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" The output color of other nonce words appears to be determined by their position relative to ""zup"" or other words whose output has already been established. A repeated word outputs the same color as the word that precedes it.",1.0,163,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in every given example. The meaning does not appear to change depending on context; ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow.""",1.0,163,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow in every given context. Other words in the examples translate as follows:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- bluf -> red
- lug -> blue

In sequences, each word is translated directly into its corresponding color without affecting adjacent words.",1.0,163,zup
"Rule: bluf -> red

Each occurrence of the word ""bluf"" is translated into the color ""red"" in the given examples.",1.0,163,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

bluf -> red

Rule: Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, it corresponds to ""red"" in the output.",1.0,163,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at each example with its corresponding output:

- wif bluf zup bluf wif -> red red yellow yellow red
- zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
- dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
- wif bluf -> red red
- wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green

It seems that occurrences of ""bluf"" consistently translate to repetitions of the prior color code in the sequence. Therefore, ""bluf"" stands for a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it. The occurrence of ""bluf"" does not seem to affect subsequent words unless they are another ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the previous color code.",1.0,163,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the given examples and identify the patterns.

- In the first example, the sequence ""wif bluf"" is followed by ""red red,"" and ""zup bluf"" is followed by ""yellow yellow."" This suggests that ""bluf"" could mean ""repeat the color of the previous word.""
- The second example has ""dax bluf,"" which results in ""green green,"" again indicating a repetition of the color associated with the word before ""bluf.""
- The third and fourth examples also support this pattern.
- The fifth example, ""wif bluf dax walm,"" is followed by ""red red green green green."" The first ""bluf"" results in a repetition of ""red,"" and then we have ""green"" repeated, although there's no second occurrence of ""bluf."" Since ""walm"" is not preceded by a ""bluf"" but still is ""green"" twice, there might be another rule at play for ""walm,"" but for ""bluf,"" the pattern of repeating the color is consistent.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.",0.9,163,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red.""",0.0,163,bluf
"Given the examples provided, let's examine the outputs corresponding to each instance where the nonce word ""walm"" appears.

Example 1:
- Input: dax walm
- Output: green green green

Example 2:
- Input: lug wif dax zup walm
- Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

Example 3:
- Input: dax walm wif
- Output: green green green red

Example 4:
- Input: dax lug wif walm
- Output: green blue red red red

Example 5:
- Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
- Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

From these examples, each time the word ""walm"" appears in the input, the corresponding output repeats the color associated with the word that directly precedes ""walm"" three times. 

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and following ""walm"" we have ""green green green.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and following ""walm"" we have ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and following ""walm"" we have ""green green green.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and following ""walm"" we have ""red red red.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and following ""walm"" we have ""yellow yellow yellow.""

From above findings, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,163,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns of its use across the examples provided:

1. dax walm -> green green green
2. lug wif dax zup walm -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow
3. dax walm wif -> green green green red
4. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red
5. zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

From the examples, we see that:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output repeats ""green"" three times.
- When ""walm"" comes at the end after several other words, it repeats the color of the word just before it three times.
- When ""walm"" is preceded by different words, it seems to always repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.
- When ""walm"" is not the last word, the pattern of repeated colors breaks, and the sequence continues with the color associated with the following word.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" acts as a repeater for the color corresponding to the word immediately before it, repeating that color three times when it is the final word in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the previous word three times when it is the last word in the sequence. If it is not the last word, the sequence continues normally after the repetition.",1.0,163,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. Here is the rule induction based on the input and output examples:

1. dax walm -> green green green (dax corresponds to green, and walm causes it to be repeated twice more)
2. lug wif dax zup walm -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow (zup corresponds to yellow, and walm causes it to be repeated twice more)
3. dax walm wif -> green green green red (dax corresponds to green, and walm repeats it twice more, wif corresponds to red and is not affected by walm)
4. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red (wif corresponds to red, and walm causes it to be repeated twice more)
5. zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green (zup corresponds to yellow, and walm causes it to be repeated twice more)

Rule: walm -> meaning. Walm causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated twice more.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: Walm causes the color word before it to be repeated two additional times.",1.0,163,walm
"Based on the examples provided, walm appears to repeat the color corresponding to the word just before it for as many times as the position where walm occurs in the sequence. Here's the breakdown according to each example:

1. Input: dax walm
   - dax corresponds to green.
   - Since walm follows dax and is the second word, it repeats green two more times.
   - Output: green green green

2. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   - Each word before walm corresponds to a color, with walm being the fifth word. The word just before walm is zup which corresponds to yellow.
   - Therefore, walm repeats the yellow color three additional times because it's in the fifth position (the initial color plus three repeats).
   - Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: dax walm wif
   - Similar to the first example, but now walm is in the second position and repeats green, and then another color, red corresponding to wif, follows.
   - Output: green green green red

4. Input: dax lug wif walm
   - Here walm is the fourth word, following wif, which corresponds to red. So walm repeats that color three times (one for the initial and two additional, making it this color in the fourth position).
   - Output: green blue red red red

5. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   - Now walm is in the second position following zup (yellow), hence it repeats the color yellow one additional time, then the sequence continues with other colors.
   - Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Rule: walm -> repeats the color corresponding to the word before it, as many times as its position in the sequence minus one.",1.0,163,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" a number of times. Specifically:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug wif dax zup,"" the output corresponding to ""zup"" is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax lug wif,"" the output corresponding to ""wif"" is ""red red red.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" the output corresponding to ""dax"" is ""green.""

However, there is an inconsistency in the second example where ""walm"" follows ""lug wif dax zup"" but the output is not threefold repetition of the color corresponding to ""zup"" but instead a threefold repetition of yellow which corresponds to ""zup"" that is two positions before ""walm."" This might be a mistake or suggest that context plays a role, but it seems unlikely based on the consistency of the other examples. Therefore, it's possible that ""lug wif dax zup walm"" output should have been ""yellow yellow yellow yellow"" instead of ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow.""

Assuming that this inconsistency is a typo or error, the rule appears to be:

walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.

Rule: If the input contains ""walm"" following a word that translates to a color, the output is the corresponding color repeated three times.",0.8,163,walm
"Based on the given examples, lug seems to be a rule for outputting the color blue. Every time the word lug appears in the input, the word blue appears in the output. Additionally, we can see that other words might translate to other colors; for instance, 'wif' appears to correspond to 'red' and 'bluf' likely corresponds to 'blue' as well (or it could be used to reinforce the blue output when it follows 'lug'). 'Dax' seems to correspond to 'green'. 

Thus, the rule can be deduced as follows:

lug -> blue

To expand on the other words based on the provided examples (though not requested, it can help in understanding the context):
- wif -> red
- bluf -> blue
- dax -> green",1.0,164,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let’s look at the examples provided and the outputs corresponding to each given input.

1. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue

2. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue

3. Input: wif lug wif
   Output: red blue red

4. Input: dax lug bluf
   Output: green blue blue

5. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue

It's clear that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"". We need to determine how ""lug"" turns into ""blue"" in all occurrences and what rule applies to ""walm"" and ""dax"" which result in ""red red"" and ""green"" respectively.

From example 1 and 5, the simple case of ""wif lug"" consistently outputs ""red blue"" which suggests ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

In the compound examples (2, 3, and 4), ""lug"" is still producing ""blue"" irrespective of its position in the input. The other patterns do not seem to have an effect on the output of ""lug"". For instance, ""walm"" appears to duplicate the color immediately preceding it, and ""dax"" results in green.

Therefore, the rule for ""lug"" can be stated as:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,164,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,164,lug
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""lug"" is associated with the output ""blue"". However, the word preceding lug affects the output as well, since each ""wif"" correlates with an output of ""red"" and ""dax"" correlates with an output of ""green"". There is consistency in the output pattern as relates to the occurrence of ""lug"" and the words before it. Here's the pattern observed:

Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue (wif corresponds to red, lug corresponds to blue)
Input: wif walm lug bluf -> Output: red red red blue blue (""wif"" corresponds to red, ""walm"" is likely a repeat function causing the previous color to repeat, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, while ""bluf"" is an additional blue)
Input: wif lug wif -> Output: red blue red (""wif"" corresponds to red, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, the second ""wif"" again corresponds to red)
Input: dax lug bluf -> Output: green blue blue (""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""bluf"" is likely an extension of blue or perhaps a pluralization)
Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue (wif corresponds to red, lug corresponds to blue, repeating the first example's output)

Rule:
lug -> blue",1.0,164,lug
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" translates to a repeating sequence of colors that seems to depend on the word it follows. Observing patterns:

- After ""wif"" the sequence is ""red blue"".
- After ""dax"" the sequence is ""green blue"".
- After ""walm"" and ""bluf"" the sequence ""red blue"" is not repeated, indicating these words themselves output colors (""walm"" outputs red, and ""bluf"" outputs blue).

It's reasonable to conclude from the data that ""lug"" represents a rule for repeating the color output of the word immediately before it. For instance:
- ""wif lug"" gives ""red blue"", where ""wif"" appears to mean ""red"", so ""lug"" is the rule that says to repeat the color output of ""wif"" and then follow with ""blue"".
- ""dax lug"" gives ""green blue"", where ""dax"" appears to mean ""green"".

However, when ""lug"" follows ""walm"" or ""bluf"", it does not create a repeating sequence but only outputs another ""blue"" after the colors that ""walm"" and ""bluf"" represent. This could indicate that ""lug"" has a default color ""blue"" that it outputs after the effect of the repetition rule, or it triggers the output of ""blue"".

Thus, the most consistent rule that could be derived from the information given is this:

Rule: lug -> Repeats the color output of the preceding word (if it is ""wif"" or ""dax"") followed by blue. If the preceding word is ""walm"" or ""bluf,"" then ""lug"" outputs only a blue.",0.8,164,lug

"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently yields the output ""red."" There are no examples here indicating that the output color for ""wif"" is dependent on context or position in the sequence; it is always the same irrespective of other words around it.

wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position or context within the sequence.",1.0,164,wif

Rule: The word 'wif' translates to the color 'red' regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,164,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs. We will make note of the consistent presence of ""zup"" and what colors it produces in the output across different examples.

- In each instance where ""zup"" appears, ""yellow"" invariably appears in the output.
- ""zup"" seems to be independent of position within the input string, as its position varies but always results in ""yellow"" in the output.
- The number of occurrences of ""zup"" in the input does not alter the number of times ""yellow"" appears in the output (it is always one yellow per ""zup"" occurrence).

From these observations, we can deduce the rule:
Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,164,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at each example and see where ""zup"" appears and what output it corresponds to.

1. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   
2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

3. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow

4. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

5. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
   Output: green green red yellow blue

From the examples provided:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""walm"" seems to consistently translate to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" appears to translate to ""green"" when it follows ""dax."" However, when it follows ""wif,"" it translates to ""red.""
- ""dax"" always translates to ""green.""

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule for ""zup"":

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,164,zup
"From the provided examples, we can attempt to induce the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup."" Let's analyze the occurrences of ""zup"" and the associated colors in the output:

1. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
2. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
3. dax zup -> green yellow
4. dax zup walm wif -> green yellow yellow yellow red
5. dax bluf wif zup lug -> green green red yellow blue

First, let's note that the word ""zup"" only appears on the input side, and there is always a ""yellow"" in the corresponding output, suggesting a direct association between ""zup"" and ""yellow."" In each case, ""zup"" correlates with a single ""yellow"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence. This suggests that ""zup"" translates directly to ""yellow"" independently of context.

Additionally, we notice that other words may correspond to other colors consistently, which supports that ""zup"" specifically equates to ""yellow."" For example, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" as well, although not when ""zup"" is present in the sequence. 

To verify the consistency of this rule, let's apply it across all examples provided:

1. zup (yellow) wif (red) walm (red) lug (red) bluf (blue)
2. zup (yellow) walm (yellow) lug (yellow) wif (blue) bluf (red red)
3. dax (green) zup (yellow)
4. dax (green) zup (yellow) walm (yellow) wif (yellow red)
5. dax (green) bluf (green) wif (red) zup (yellow) lug (blue)

The rule appears to fit each of the examples given, so we can conclude with the following induction:

Rule: zup translates to ""yellow"" in the output regardless of its position or other surrounding words in the input.",1.0,164,zup
"Given the inputs and outputs, it is possible to deduce what ""zup"" translates to in terms of color output. Let’s examine each example:

1. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   Analysis: ""wif"" produces a ""red"", ""walm"" produces a ""red"", and ""lug"" produces a ""blue"". 

2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   Analysis: ""walm"" produces a ""yellow"", ""lug"" produces a ""yellow"", ""wif"" produces a ""red"", and ""bluf"" produces a ""red"".

3. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow
   Analysis: ""dax"" produces a ""green"". 

4. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   Analysis: ""dax"" produces a ""green"", ""walm"" produces a ""yellow"", and ""wif"" produces a ""red"".

5. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
   Output: green green red yellow blue
   Analysis: ""dax"" produces a ""green"", ""bluf"" produces a ""green"", ""wif"" produces a ""red"", and ""lug"" produces a ""blue"".

By comparing these examples and outputs, we can conclude that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input string.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,164,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we should look for patterns that can be related to the transformation of the inputs into a sequence of colors in the outputs. Let's analyze the patterns:

1. Whenever ""zup"" appears, the color ""yellow"" is always included in the output sequence.
2. The number of ""yellow"" in the output does not seem to directly correlate to the number of times ""zup"" is mentioned in the input (it is mentioned once but may correspond to multiple ""yellow"" outputs).
3. Other words following or preceding ""zup"" seem to determine the position and count of ""yellow"" in the output.

For instance:
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm lug"" or ""lug,"" it outputs one ""yellow"" followed by ""red blue"" or ""yellow blue"", respectively.
- When ""zup"" follows ""walm lug"" or ""lug,"" it results in ""yellow"" followed by multiple ""yellow"" and then ""blue"" and multiple ""red.""

From the given data, we may induce the following pattern concerning ""zup"":

- ""zup"" indicates a color sequence starting with ""yellow.""
- It may also act as a modifier for the preceding/following words, determining the count and sequence of the following colors.

There is not enough consistent evidence to deduce a more precise rule for ""zup"" based solely on the examples provided, particularly concerning the influence on the number of colors following it. However, it seems evident that ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow"" and may influence the sequence or count of colors following it in the output.

Rule: ""zup"" introduces a sequence starting with the color ""yellow"" and influences the sequence and count of the following colors. The exact influence requires additional context not provided in the examples.

Hence, we can suggest:
zup -> initiates a sequence with ""yellow"" and affects subsequent color pattern.",0.8,164,zup
"From analyzing the examples provided, we can deduce the following pattern between the input and output:

- In example 1, input ""bluf"" corresponds to output ""blue"".
- In example 2, input ""bluf"" corresponds to output ""yellow blue"" when it appears after ""lug"", but those colors correspond to ""lug"" and ""zup"", which indicates that the output ""blue"" for ""bluf"" is consistent, whereas ""yellow"" corresponds to ""lug"".
- In example 3, input ""bluf"" corresponds to output ""red blue"" when it appears after ""wif"", but given the consistent correspondence of ""blue"" to ""bluf"" in previous examples, we can assume ""red"" corresponds to ""wif"".
- In example 4, input ""bluf"" corresponds to output ""red red green"", but since the output ""red"" can be correlated with ""wif"" from a previous example, and ""green"" seems to correlate with ""dax"", we can reinforce the guess that ""bluf"" consistently correlates to ""blue"".
- In example 5, input ""bluf"" corresponds to output ""red red green"", with ""bluf"" specifically corresponding to the second ""red"" (as ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red""), indicating once more that the term on its own translates to ""blue"".

From these patterns, it appears that regardless of where ""bluf"" occurs in the sequence, the output color is always ""blue"". Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> blue",1.0,164,bluf
"bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red."" This conclusion is drawn from the pattern that whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.",0.0,164,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"". However, when ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" or ""zup"", it translates to ""blue"" instead of ""red"". Therefore, ""bluf"" generally translates to ""red"" but changes to ""blue"" under specific conditions related to preceding words.

Rule: bluf -> red when it is not preceded by ""lug"" or ""zup"", and bluf -> blue when it follows ""lug"" or ""zup"".",0.0,164,bluf
"bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red."" Each occurrence of ""bluf"" in the inputs results in ""red"" in the outputs, regardless of its position in the sequence.",0.0,164,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,0.0,164,bluf
"Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word as many times as the number of letters in the word ""walm"" (which is three times). 

So ""walm"" following any color word leads to that color repeated three times. For example, after ""dax"" (which translates to ""green""), ""walm"" results in ""green green green"".",1.0,164,walm
"walm -> repeating the last mentioned color an additional two times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is used, it indicates that the last color mentioned before ""walm"" should be said two more times than it already has been. If a color is mentioned once and then ""walm"" follows, that color is then repeated three times total. If a color is mentioned twice and then ""walm"" follows, the color is then said four times total, and so on.",1.0,164,walm
"Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""walm"" when placed after a color word repeats the color word's corresponding output color multiple times. ""Walm"" appears to take the last color mentioned and then repeats it in the output for as many times as ""walm"" appears plus one additional time for the initially mentioned color. Essentially, ""walm"" acts as a duplicator of the last color mentioned before it.

Let's break down the examples:

1. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". After ""zup"" which is yellow, we have ""walm"" and then ""lug"". The output has three instances of ""yellow"" followed by ""blue"", which corresponds to ""lug"".

2. ""zup walm dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green"". ""Zup"" is yellow, followed by ""walm"", and the output shows three instances of ""yellow"" before the ""green"" which corresponds to ""dax"".

3. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"". Here, ""dax"" is green and ""walm"" follows it. The output shows three instances of ""green"".

4. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"". After ""wif"" which is red, ""walm"" appears, resulting in three copies of ""red"" in the sequence before ending with ""blue"", which corresponds to ""lug"".

Based on this, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the last mentioned color's corresponding output an additional number of times equal to the count of ""walm"" plus one.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeats the previous color mentioned an additional number of times equal to the count of ""walm"" plus one.",1.0,164,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which is translated to ""yellow"", and thus ""walm"" results in repeated ""yellow"" outputs until the next color word is introduced. Similarly, ""walm"" after ""dax"" leads to repeated ""green,"" and after ""lug"" leads to repeated ""blue."" Also, ""walm"" following ""wif"" results in repeated ""red.""

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color indicated by the immediately preceding word until another color word appears.",1.0,164,walm
"Rule: walm -> the color represented by the word immediately preceding it, repeated as many times as the word ""walm"" itself appears in sequence.",1.0,164,walm

"Based on the given examples, we can observe that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that come before or after it.

Therefore, the rule is:

"From the given examples, it can be seen that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" Regardless of its position in the sentence, ""wif"" produces the same output. As such, we can infer that ""wif"" directly translates to the color ""red.""

"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates directly to the color ""red"".",1.0,165,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup"", let's analyze the patterns:

- Wherever ""lug"" appears, ""blue"" follows.
- ""wif"" corresponds to always being followed by ""red"".
- ""walm"" is always followed by ""red"".
- ""dax"" is always followed by ""green"".
- ""bluf"" is always followed by ""yellow"".
- ""zup"" seems to be followed by ""yellow"", but it does not always precede it directly. 

Now let's check the pattern considering every time ""zup"" appears:

1. ""lug zup"" -> ""blue yellow"" (zup follows lug)
2. ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue"" (zup precedes wif, which is followed by red)
3. ""zup bluf lug zup"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow"" (zup precedes bluf and follows lug, where bluf is followed by yellow and lug by blue)
4. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> ""yellow red green green green blue"" (zup precedes wif, which is followed by red; dax by green; walm also by red but is followed by multiple reds, and lug by blue)
5. ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow"" (zup follows dax which is followed by green, and bluf is followed by yellow)

From these observations, we can deduce a pattern where ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"". The ""yellow"" representation often (but not strictly) follows after ""zup"" except when preceded by ""lug"" or another ""zup"". Therefore, it doesn't affect the colors after it but adds ""yellow"" to the sequence.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,165,zup
"Using the provided examples, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup.""

- In every example where the word ""zup"" appears, the color ""yellow"" also appears in the output.

This is supported by the consistent appearance of ""yellow"" for every instance of ""zup"" across all given examples:

- ""lug zup"" -> ""blue yellow""
- ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue""
- ""zup bluf lug zup"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow""
- ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> ""yellow red green green green blue""
- ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""

From this, we can induce that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Therefore:

- ""zup bluf lug zup"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow""
- ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> ""yellow red green green green blue""

- ""wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow,"" so ""bluf"" takes the color ""yellow"" from ""zup.""
- ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red,"" so ""bluf"" takes the color ""red"" from ""wif.""
- ""wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green green,"" so ""bluf"" takes the color ""green"" from ""dax.""
- ""zup dax bluf"" translates to ""yellow green green,"" so ""bluf"" takes the color ""green"" from ""dax.""

Rule: walm -> blue,1.0,165,walm
"Based on the examples provided, walm seems to correlate with a repeating color pattern. Specifically, walm appears to result in the repetition of the color that directly precedes it in the sequence. Here is the breakdown:

1. In the first three examples:
   ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red.""
   Since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and walm causes the output ""red red red,"" it suggests that walm means a repetition of ""wif"" (which is ""red"").

2. In the fourth example:
   ""zup dax lug walm zup"" results in ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow.""
   Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and walm causes the color ""blue"" to be repeated twice, maintaining the original sequence's order at the end.

3. In the fifth example:
   ""lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue.""
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and walm causes the color ""yellow"" to be repeated twice. 

The rule appears consistent across all examples; therefore, we can deduce:

walm -> meaning: Walm represents a command to repeat the color that precedes it in the sequence multiple times (twice, based on the provided data).

Rule: If X color precedes walm in a sequence, X color is repeated multiple times after walm.",1.0,165,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce that each word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" as evidenced by its repeated association in the outputs. Similarly, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The word ""walm"" appears in various contexts but always results in the word ""red"" when directly following ""wif,"" and ""blue"" when in any other context.

Given these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" does not have a fixed color output but rather its output changes depending on the context or the words surrounding it. However, with the limited examples provided, the specific rule governing this change is not clear. We can summarize the information as follows:

walm -> meaning. The meaning depends on the context: 
- When following ""wif,"" ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- In other contexts, ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Rule: ""walm"" changes color based on its position and surrounding words, specifically turning red when following ""wif"" and blue otherwise. More examples would be needed to refine or confirm this rule.",0.8,165,walm
"walm -> meaning. Based on the given examples, walm appears to take on the color value that precedes it. However, without a variation in the color that precedes ""walm,"" we cannot be certain that it always takes the previous color's value or if it is coincidental due to lack of varied examples.

Rule: The word ""walm"" mirrors the color word that immediately precedes it in the sequence.",0.8,165,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the examples and their outputs:

- In the first three examples, the input ""wif walm"" consistently results in the output ""red red red."" This suggests that ""wif walm"" directly translates to ""red red red,"" but since ""wif"" appears only once and there are three instances of ""red,"" it's not clear what ""walm"" contributes to this translation.

- In the fourth example, the input ""zup dax lug walm zup"" yields the output ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow."" Here, ""zup"" appears twice, both at the beginning and the end, and in the output, ""yellow"" also appears twice in the same positions, suggesting ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" ""Dax"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""green"" and ""blue,"" respectively, while ""walm"" again corresponds to an additional ""blue.""

- In the fifth example, ""lug zup walm lug"" leads to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" Based on previous deductions, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The presence of ""walm"" yields two additional ""yellow,"" similar to the previous example, where ""walm"" resulted in extra repetition of the last color mentioned.

Based on these examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the last mentioned color to repeat. However, because there isn't an instance where different colors follow ""walm"" to test this repetition theory further, the evidence is limited. Nonetheless, the available examples suggest that ""walm"" could be a rule indicating repetition of the last color in the sequence.

1. The first example associates ""dax"" with a single ""green,"" ""wif"" with a single ""red,"" and ""zup"" with a single ""yellow."" However, ""walm"" is followed by three ""green"" suggesting that ""walm"" causes the color before it to repeat three times.

2. In the second example, ""lug"" is followed by three ""blue,"" which implies that ""lug"" on its own translates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes the repetition.

3. The third example solidifies that ""walm"" is causing the repetition because ""lug"" is ""blue” and ""wif"" is ""red,"" but when ""walm"" follows them, it causes that color to repeat three times.

4. The fourth and fifth examples support the same rule because ""walm"" consistently causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat three times.

Based on the consistent pattern across all examples, we conclude that:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to repeat three times.

Therefore: walm -> causes the preceding color to repeat three times.",1.0,166,walm
"Based on the examples given, it appears that ""walm"" correlates with the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. Here's the pattern that emerges:

- dax walm -> green repeated (green green green)
- lug walm -> blue repeated (blue blue blue)
- zup lug walm wif walm -> blue repeated (blue blue blue), red repeated (red red red)
- dax lug walm -> blue repeated (blue blue blue)
- wif dax lug walm -> blue repeated (blue blue blue)

We can induce the rule as follows:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times.

Therefore:
walm -> Repetition of the preceding color three times.",1.0,166,walm
"From the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"" as follows:

Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow
- Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. ""walm"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif"" and the output has an additional green between them.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue and is followed by ""walm,"" which results in two additional blue words.

Input: zup lug walm wif walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
- ""zup"" is yellow, ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red, with ""walm"" following both ""lug"" and ""wif."" After each, there is a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""walm.""

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" resulting in two more blues.

Input: wif dax lug walm
Output: red green blue blue blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""lug"" corresponds to blue. ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and again results in two more blues.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the next output color to be repeated two more times. For example, when ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), we get two additional blues, and when ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), we get two additional greens, and so forth.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" causes the color of the word that precedes it to be outputted two additional times.",1.0,166,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with the repetition of a color multiple times in succession. In each output, ""walm"" follows a color word (or a nonce word that is mapped to a specific color), causing that color to be repeated three times.

Here is the breakdown of how ""walm"" works in each input:

- Input: dax walm wif zup | Output: green green green red yellow
  ""dax"" correlates with ""green"", so ""walm"" makes ""green"" appear three times before the sequence continues.

- Input: lug walm | Output: blue blue blue
  ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"", and ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.

- Input: zup lug walm wif walm | Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
  ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"", and is displayed once. ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"", and ""walm"" makes ""blue"" appear three times. Then ""wif"" correlates with ""red"" and is followed by ""walm"", causing ""red"" to be repeated three times.

- Input: dax lug walm | Output: green blue blue blue
  ""dax"" correlates with ""green"". ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"", and ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to repeat three times.

- Input: wif dax lug walm | Output: red green blue blue blue
  ""wif"" correlates with ""red"". ""dax"" correlates with ""green"". ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"", and ""walm"" makes ""blue"" appear three times.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" based on the examples seems to be:

walm -> Repeat the immediately preceding color three times.

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Let's explore this pattern through the examples:

- In the second example, ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" gives ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""blue,"" resulting in ""blue blue blue.""
- In the third example, ""zup lug walm wif walm,"" the pattern of ""walm"" repeating the color continues: ""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" then ""lug"" is ""blue""; ""walm"" results in ""blue blue""; ""wif"" is ""red,"" and another ""walm"" results in ""red red red.""
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" three times, just as in the previous instances.

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine its corresponding output in each example.

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is translated to ""red"" when it is preceded by ""wif dax wif"" and followed by ""zup.""
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when preceded by ""wif dax wif.""
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red"" when it is preceded by ""wif.""
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" when it is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""zup.""
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" when it is immediately preceded by ""dax.""

From these examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" takes its meaning from the word immediately preceding it, based on the following observations:

- When preceded by ""wif,"" ""bluf"" becomes ""red.""
- When preceded by ""lug,"" ""bluf"" becomes ""blue.""
- When preceded by ""dax,"" ""bluf"" becomes ""green.""
- The word following ""bluf"" doesn't seem to influence its meaning.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the word immediately preceding it: ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" leads to ""green.""

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color corresponding to the word just before it - ""wif"" gives ""red,"" ""lug"" gives ""blue,"" and ""dax"" gives ""green.""",1.0,167,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at its correlation with the output in each example:

1. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
   - Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

2. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
   Output: red green red red yellow red
   - Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red."" However, note that in the first example, ""bluf"" also corresponded to ""yellow,"" which was the color output for ""zup"" in this example.

3. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
   Output: green yellow red red blue
   - In this example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
   - Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""

5. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   - ""Bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

Given the inconsistencies, it seems like ""bluf"" does not correspond to a consistent color output. Rather, ""bluf"" might take on the color of the previous word in the series:

- In Example 1, the previous word ""zup"" produces ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" also yields ""yellow.""
- In Example 2, the previous word ""wif"" produces ""red,"" so ""bluf"" yields ""red.""
- In Example 3, the previous word ""wif"" produces ""red,"" so ""bluf"" yields ""red.""
- In Example 4, the previous word ""lug"" produces ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" produces ""blue"" as well.
- In Example 5, the previous word ""dax"" produces ""green,"" so ""bluf"" yields ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the previous word in the sequence.",1.0,167,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

1. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
'bluf' follows 'zup', and in the output, 'yellow' is followed by 'red'.

2. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
Output: red green red red yellow red
'bluf' follows 'wif', and in the output, 'red' is followed by 'red'.

3. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
Output: green yellow red red blue
'bluf' follows 'wif', and in the output, 'red' is again followed by 'red'.

4. Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
'bluf' follows 'lug' and 'zup', and in the output, 'blue' follows 'lug', and 'yellow' follows 'zup'. In this instance, 'bluf' also comes before 'zup' and the output corresponding is 'yellow'.

5. Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green
'bluf' follows 'dax', and in the output 'green' follows 'green'.

From these examples, we observe that 'bluf' seems to take on the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the output. This pattern holds for all given examples.

Rule:
bluf -> takes on the color represented by the word that precedes it in the output.

For example, if ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output, then ""bluf"" after ""dax"" would also correspond to ""green"" in the output.",1.0,167,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word translates to a color. Let's break down each input and its corresponding output to determine the rule for each word:

Input 1: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output 1: yellow yellow red green red yellow

Input 2: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
Output 2: red green red red yellow red

Input 3: dax zup wif bluf lug
Output 3: green yellow red red blue

Input 4: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
Output 4: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red

Input 5: wif dax bluf
Output 5: red green green

From these examples, we can infer the following relationships between the words and colors:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" except when followed by ""bluf"", then ""bluf"" seems to take on the color ""green.""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""

With the exception where ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the word ""bluf"" appears to adopt the color that would have been assigned to the word ""dax."" Therefore:

bluf -> green when following the word ""dax,"" at least in the examples provided.

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color green, but the rule might be context-dependent based on its position relative to other words, especially ""dax.""",0.8,167,bluf
"Observing the given inputs and their corresponding outputs, the rule for the word ""bluf"" can be determined by comparing its position and the output color across different examples.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

Looking at the fourth example, we observe that ""bluf"" results in a different color (""blue"") than in the other examples. The instances of ""bluf"" leading to ""red"" occur whenever ""wif"" or ""dax"" precedes it:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red.""
- In the second and third examples, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and ""dax,"" respectively, and both result in ""red.""

However, in the fourth and fifth examples where ""bluf"" yields a color different from ""red,"" it follows ""lug"" and ""dax,"" respectively:

- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green.""

Given the inconsistency in the output color in the fifth example compared to the second and third (where ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in ""red""), we don't have a clear rule for ""bluf"" following ""dax.""

Given this information, it's challenging to define a clear rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" due to the inconsistency observed. The data suggests that the output color for ""bluf"" might depend on the word that precedes it, but there is insufficient consistent information to fully understand the underlying rule.

Based on the information provided, a possible rule induction is:

Rule:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the resulting color is ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the resulting color is ""blue.""

This still leaves ambiguity when ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" or other words, as seen in the examples. Further data would be needed to fully discern the rules applying to ""bluf.""",0.2,167,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a triplication of the color that precedes it.

Here are the observations:

1. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" translates to ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue."" The word ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and there are triple ""yellow"" colors following it.

2. ""lug walm zup walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" corresponding to ""blue"" and results in triple ""blue"" colors and then ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"" and results in triple ""yellow"" colors.

3. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow"" and results in triple ""yellow"" colors.

4. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" where ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green"" and results in triple ""green"" colors.

From the above examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color word that comes immediately before it to repeat three times. If we convert this observation into a rule for the meaning of ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.",1.0,167,walm
"walm -> meaning. Rule:

Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it, repeated three times.

- In the first example, ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" translates to ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue""; here ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" leads to the repetition of ""yellow"" three times.
- In the second example, ""lug walm zup walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow""; ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"", with ""walm"" repeating the colors three times respectively.
- In the third example ""zup walm"", we see ""yellow"" repeated three times, indicating that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"" both times, suggesting ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""walm"" repeats that color thrice.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it, three times in the output.",1.0,167,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each example and the corresponding output.

1. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" results in ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue."" The sequence ""wif lug"" at the beginning corresponds to ""red blue"" and ""wif lug"" at the end corresponds to ""red blue"" as well. The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" In this instance, ""walm"" seems to output two additional ""yellow""s after ""zup.""

2. ""lug walm zup walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" we get two additional ""blue""s. ""Zup walm"" follows the pattern we saw in the first example with ""yellow yellow yellow.""

3. ""zup walm"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow,"" following the same pattern as before, one ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and two additional ""yellows"" for ""walm.""

4. ""dax walm"" and the next example both result in ""green green green."" ""Dax"" leads to one ""green,"" and ""walm"" adds two more ""green""s.

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color word associated with the preceding word in the input (red for ""wif,"" blue for ""lug,"" yellow for ""zup,"" and green for ""dax"") to be repeated two more times in the output.

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" is used as a function that changes the corresponding color word that follows it. Each unique word (non-""wif"") appears to be associated with a specific color. Here are the associations based on the examples:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

When ""wif"" precedes these words, the color that follows the translated word is red. This red output occurs regardless of the color's original association. The rule seems to be:

Rule: When the word ""wif"" precedes a word associated with a color, the output is red for that word. The word ""wif"" itself translates to red when it is followed by another color word, but does not have an output when it stands alone.",1.0,168,wif
"From the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" translates to ""red."" However, the output includes colors that correspond to the other input words as well, suggesting that each input word might be associated with a specific color. Let's inspect each example individually to figure out what each word might mean:

- ""dax wif zup"" corresponds to ""green red yellow"" which suggests that ""dax"" -> green, ""wif"" -> red, and ""zup"" -> yellow.
- ""lug wif zup wif"" corresponds to ""blue red yellow red"" which suggests that ""lug"" -> blue and the ""wif"" usage remains consistent with the interpretation of red.
- ""wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""red blue green,"" which supports the previous associations given for ""lug"" and ""dax"" with the order of colors matching the input.
- ""dax wif"" corresponds to ""green red,"" which once again matches the earlier observed meaning of ""dax"" and ""wif.""
- ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green."" Here, ""walm"" seems to be a new word, but it also translates to ""yellow,"" like ""zup"" does, and the other color associations remain the same.

Therefore, based on these examples, we can deduce the following associations:

""dax"" -> green,
""lug"" -> blue,
""zup"" -> yellow,
""walm"" -> yellow.

And the rule for ""wif"" seems to consistently be:

wif -> red.",1.0,168,wif
"Based on the examples provided, I will identify patterns to deduce the meaning of ""wif"". Let's examine the inputs and corresponding outputs:

Input: lug wif zup wif
Output: blue red yellow red

Input: wif lug dax
Output: red blue green

Input: dax wif
Output: green red

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax

Observations and deductions:

1. When ""wif"" follows ""dax,"" ""red"" follows ""green"":
   - ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""
   - ""dax wif zup"" -> ""green red yellow""
   - ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green""

2. When ""wif"" follows ""lug,"" ""red"" follows ""blue"":
   - ""lug wif zup wif"" -> ""blue red yellow red""
   - It seems that ""red"" is inserted into the sequence whenever ""wif"" appears.

3. ""wif"" might serve as an indicator to insert ""red"" after the color corresponding to the word before it.

4. There's an exception when ""wif"" is at the start of the sequence:
   - ""wif lug dax"" -> ""red blue green""
   - Here, ""wif"" produces ""red"" at the start, not after another color.

5. ""wif"" can also be at the end:
   - ""lug wif zup wif"" -> ""blue red yellow red""
   - Here, ""wif"" at the end still adds ""red"" after the color corresponding to the last word before it.

From these observations, the rule appears to be:

wif -> Inserts the color ""red"" after the color that corresponds to the word directly preceding ""wif"". When ""wif"" is at the beginning of a sequence, it starts with ""red"".

- In ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf,"" bluf again follows ""dax,"" and thus means green.

- In ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup,"" the first bluf follows ""zup"" representing yellow, the second bluf follows ""lug"" representing blue, and if bluf were at the beginning it would default to ""wif's"" red.

Therefore:

"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color that is named just before ""bluf"" in the input sequence.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and since ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""red red.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" follows ""zup."" Therefore, the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow yellow.""

- In the fourth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" leading to ""yellow yellow.""
- The fifth example confirms that ""bluf"" repeats the color before it — ""zup"" (yellow), ""lug"" (blue), and ""dax"" (green) lead to double of the same colors following each occurrence of ""bluf.""

Thus, bluf -> the color of the word preceding it in the sequence.",1.0,169,bluf
"Analyzing the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to a specific color in the output. To determine the rule, let's compare the input with its corresponding output:

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

In this example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" also results in ""red."" It suggests that ""bluf"" could mean the color that precedes it, i.e., ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word before it.

Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and the ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""yellow"", which was the color of the word before ""bluf"".

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green

In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", so when ""bluf"" appears after ""dax,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""green"".

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

In this case, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" again.

Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow

This example also supports the rule that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it.

Rule: Bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it. If the preceding word is ""wif,"" ""bluf"" means red; if it's ""zup,"" ""bluf"" means yellow; if it's ""lug,"" it would mean blue; and if ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" means green.",1.0,169,bluf
"Analyzing the given examples and their corresponding outputs, an attempt to deduce the pattern or rule for the nonce word ""walm"" will be made.

Let's take a closer look at each instance of ""walm.""

1. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
2. wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
3. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
4. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
5. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow

In each case, ""walm"" seems to result in a sequence of ""yellow"" repeated three times in the output.

Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color output of the next word three times. For clarification:

- In the first example, ""lug"" comes after ""walm"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" After ""walm,"" we get ""blue"" three times.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is the last word. Looking at the output, after ""walm"" there are three ""yellow"" which correspond to the previous word ""zup.""
- In the third and fourth examples, ""walm"" again leads to three repetitions of the word ""yellow,"" following the same pattern.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" is the word after ""walm,"" and in the output ""green"" is repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:
walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the next word three times.

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color of the word immediately following it to appear three times in the output.",1.0,169,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in relation to the outputs:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" or ""zup"", the output seems to be ""yellow yellow yellow.""
2. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output turns into ""red red red.""
3. ""Walm"" does not appear at the beginning of any input or as the last element of any input example, so we cannot see its effect in isolation or at the end of a sequence.

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word preceding it three times. 

If ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" then we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,169,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let’s look for patterns in the input and corresponding output sequences. We can make an initial observation that ""walm"" seems to be associated with colors in the output, specifically the word ""yellow.""

Let’s analyze:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the corresponding output is ""blue yellow.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" is at the end after ""zup,"" and the output ends with ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the colors ""yellow"" repeat twice in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is after ""zup,"" and ""yellow"" follows twice in the output.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is after ""wif,"" and the output has a repeated ""red.""

There seems to be a consistent rule that after a color word, if ""walm"" appears, the corresponding output color is repeated. Let’s try to formulate the rule based on these observations:

Rule: When ""walm"" occurs after a color word in the input, the corresponding output repeats the color word given for the previous color word in the output.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the output color word that precedes it.

So if the preceding word's output is ""blue,"" then ""walm"" results in another ""blue."" If the preceding word's output is ""yellow,"" then ""walm"" results in another ""yellow,"" and so on.",1.0,169,walm
"Based on the examples given, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it. For every instance of ""walm,"" the output color is the same as the color that is output for the word right before ""walm."" We can confirm this with the following observations:

1. In example one: ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue"".
2. In example two: ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"".
3. In example three: ""zup walm"" again leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"".
4. In example four: ""zup walm"" yet again leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"".
5. In example five: ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"".

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word.",1.0,169,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we must discern a pattern from the example inputs and outputs:

1. The first example shows that ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output sequence includes an extra ""blue."" This suggests that ""walm"" could translate to ""blue"" after ""lug.""
   ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue blue""

2. The second example also has ""walm"" following ""zup,"" leading to a sequence of three ""yellow"" in the output. This pattern might suggest ""walm"" converts to ""yellow"" after ""zup.""
   ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" -> ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow""

3. The third example shows ""walm"" following ""zup"" as well, generating an additional ""yellow"" in the output.
   ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""

4. In the fourth example, we see ""walm"" after ""zup,"" followed by ""dax"" and ""wif bluf,"" which again leads to a string of ""yellow"" in the output.
   ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""

5. The final example has ""walm"" following ""wif,"" which leads to two more ""red"" in the output.
   ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""

Based on these examples, the pattern appears to be that ""walm"" causes the next word to be repeated in the output sequence, and the repeated color corresponds to the color associated with the word that precedes ""walm.""

Thus, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" is that it leads to the repetition of the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the input sequence.

"Based on the examples provided, we need to infer the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" in the context of sequences of words transformed into sequences of colors.

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears, it translates to the color ""green.""
2. Other words seem to be consistently translating to specific colors as well, like ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""walm"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
3. The word ""bluf"" does not have an Input: example to directly relate it to a color, but in the Output: it corresponds to ""yellow,"" like ""zup."" However, because it is repeated, it could follow a rule that repetition indicates maintaining the same color.

"Examining the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""dax.""

3. wif dax lug dax -> red green blue green
4. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
5. zup bluf wif dax lug -> yellow yellow red green blue

From the examples, we can observe the following:

- Whenever ""dax"" is present, the word ""green"" immediately follows in the output.
- ""Dax"" seems to be independent of its position in the input string (it can be at the beginning, middle, or end) and still the word ""green"" follows.
- After ""dax,"" the words in the input result in a color pattern in the output that does not seem to be directly modified by the presence of the word ""dax."" This indicates that ""dax"" could correspond to the color ""green"" no matter what the context is.

Based on these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green

Meaning that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the output.",1.0,170,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Reasoning: In every input-output pair, the presence of the word ""dax"" consistently correlates with the word ""green"" in the output. Regardless of its position or the words around it, ""dax"" translates to ""green"".",1.0,170,dax
"Based on the examples given, it appears that ""dax"" is associated with the word ""green"", as every instance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

- ""lug"" is always mapped to ""blue""
- ""wif"" is always mapped to ""red""
- ""walm"" is always mapped to multiple ""red"" outputs
- ""zup"" is mapped to ""yellow"", and when it's repeated in the input, it leads to multiple ""yellow"" outputs

I notice that when the word ""walm"" appears, it is followed by repeating the color ""red"" as many times as ""walm"" appears. Similarly, ""zup"" is followed by repeating ""yellow"". However, ""dax"", ""lug"", and ""wif"" do not exhibit this repeating behavior in the examples provided.

Taking all these observations into account, the rule can be determined as follows:

"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to consistently correspond to the color ""red"" in the output. Thus, the rule that dictates the meaning of ""bluf"" is:

Rule: bluf -> red",0.0,170,bluf
"Rule: walm -> an increase in the amount of the last color mentioned before it.

Explanation: Each time ""walm"" appears in the input, the output repeats the last mentioned color an increased number of times.

- In the first input example, the last color mentioned before ""walm"" is blue (""lug""), and the output following ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue,"" showing an increase in the quantity of blue.

- In the second input example, the last color mentioned before ""walm"" is yellow (""zup""), and the output following ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating an increase in the quantity of yellow.

- In the third input example, the last color mentioned before ""walm"" is green (""dax""), and the output following ""walm"" is ""green green green,"" showing an increase in the number of greens.

- In the fourth input example, the last color mentioned before ""walm"" is red (""wif""), and the output following ""walm"" is ""red red red,"" demonstrating an increase in the quantity of red.

- In the fifth input example, the last color mentioned before ""walm"" is red (""wif""), and the output following ""walm"" is ""red red red,"" again showing an increase in the number of reds.",1.0,170,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine the usage of ""walm"" in each example and the corresponding output pattern. Here is what we observe from the given examples:

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""bluf"" corresponds to another yellow (so ""bluf"" might mean repeating the color mentioned just before it), ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" leads to repeating blue.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" follows with two more yellows, indicating repetition.

Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""dax"" to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""wif"" to red. There are repeating greens, and ""walm"" is followed by green before ""wif"" changes it to red.

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" to red, ""lug"" to blue. The appearance of ""walm"" generates additional reds (repeating the color mentioned before it).

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""bluf"" repeats the previous yellow, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" again repeats the color mentioned before it, which is red in this case.

Rule:
Based on the patterns, ""walm"" appears to signal a repetition of the color output corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. In every example, the occurrence of ""walm"" has been associated with repeating the color given before it multiple times in the output. Therefore, we have:

walm -> Triggers repetition of the color corresponding to the prior word mentioned in the input.",1.0,170,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Let's analyze the examples:

- In the first example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" the word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" Therefore, the output is ""blue blue blue,"" signifying repetition of ""blue"" equal to the number of times ""lug"" has occurred plus one for ""walm.""

- In the second example, ""zup walm,"" the word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" Therefore, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" meaning ""walm"" produces two additional ""yellow"" outputs (one for ""zup"" and one for ""walm"").

- In the third example, ""lug dax zup dax walm wif,"" ""walm"" follows after ""dax,"" which relates to ""green."" Hence, we see ""green green green"" in the output; ""green"" for ""dax"" and two extra ""green"" for ""walm.""

- In the fourth and fifth examples, it follows the same pattern where ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color of the word that precedes it.

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be output additional times, equal to the total number of times that word has appeared in the sequence thus far plus one additional time for ""walm"" itself.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word, adding occurrences for the number of times that word has been mentioned already plus one for ""walm.""",1.0,170,walm
"From the given examples, we can analyze the pattern of outputs relative to the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" and other words. Here is the analysis:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   
2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   
3. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif

4. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   
5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

If we scrutinize the examples, we can notice that ""walm"" seems to cause the color mentioned immediately before it to repeat for the rest of the sequence. 

Looking at Example 1, after the word ""lug,"" the output is one ""blue"" followed by the word ""walm,"" and the subsequent colors are all ""blue.""

In Examples 2 and 3, every color following ""walm"" is a repeat of the color directly before ""walm.""

Similarly, in Examples 4 and 5, prior to ""walm,"" there are different colors mentioned (""red"" in Example 4 and ""red"" in Example 5), and after ""walm,"" those colors repeat.

Rule: walm -> causes the previous color to repeat for the rest of the sequence.",1.0,170,walm
"walm -> repeats the color of the last word mentioned before it. Rule: Walm takes on the meaning (color) of the word that immediately precedes it and repeats that meaning for the number of times equal to the number of letters in the word.

There are no instances where ""lug"" leads to a different word in the output, and ""lug"" does not appear to alter depending on context or its position in the input sequence.

With this in mind, the rule for ""lug"" can be summarized as follows:

"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.",1.0,171,lug
"From the provided examples, it seems that the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" is context-dependent, relating specifically to the colors that follow it in the outputs. Here's what we can deduce from the examples:

1. When ""dax"" precedes ""zup bluf,"" the output is ""green yellow yellow."" We observe that ""green"" is associated with ""dax,"" and ""yellow"" appears for both ""zup"" and ""bluf.""

2. When ""dax"" comes before ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green,"" which suggests that ""green"" is associated with ""dax"" and ""walm"" individually, as well as combined.

3. When ""dax"" precedes ""wif,"" the output is ""green red."" Here, ""green"" is linked to ""dax,"" and ""red"" is linked to ""wif.""

4. When ""dax"" is at the end of the input string as in ""wif zup walm dax zup,"" the output follows the previous patterns for ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""walm,"" until we reach ""dax,"" which results in ""green.""

5. The last example, ""dax walm wif bluf,"" follows the established pattern. ""Dax"" is followed by ""green,"" ""walm"" by ""green,"" and then ""wif"" by ""red."" ""Bluf,"" which follows ""wif,"" results in an additional ""red,"" indicating a context-dependent reaction when ""wif"" precedes ""bluf.""

Given these observations, it appears that ""dax"" specifically correlates to the output ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence; therefore, the other words (like ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and ""bluf"") yield their respective colors that may depend on their position and the context created by adjacent words.

Rule: dax -> green. The meaning of ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output sequence.",1.0,171,dax
"dax -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: The word ""dax"" appears to signal the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string. When ""dax"" is followed by the same word (""walm walm"" or ""wif wif""), the consistent output is ""green green green"" or ""green red,"" respectively, suggesting that the repeat of the word doesn't alter the initial ""green"" signaled by ""dax"". However, when ""dax"" is followed by different words, the output colors vary, indicating that the other words determine the subsequent colors, independent of ""dax."" Therefore, the rule associated with ""dax"" is that it signals the output of the color ""green"" once. Subsequent colors must be deduced from the other words in the sequence.",0.9,171,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" is connected to the color output of ""green,"" but the meaning changes depending on the context in which ""dax"" is used. Here are the associations drawn from the input-output pairs:

1. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" appears to mean green here, as the first output is green.

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - In this example, ""dax"" again corresponds to green, as does ""walm,"" indicating ""walm"" might also mean green.

3. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
   - Here, ""dax"" produces green, and ""wif"" produces red.

4. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   - ""wif"" starts with red, following the same pattern as previous examples. ""zup"" and ""walm"" give yellow output, followed by ""dax"" which is, again, green.

5. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   - ""dax"" leads to green, ""walm"" is repeated as green confirming its meaning from example 2, then ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" is red too, which differs from example 1, suggesting perhaps ""zup"" was responsible for the yellow in ""bluf"".

Considering the repetition and consistency of ""dax"" being followed by the output of green, it seems that ""dax"" directly translates to or triggers the output of ""green."" However, the other words (""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf"") also affect the output and can either maintain the color triggered by ""dax"" or change it depending on their own rules.

Rule: dax -> green (Dax consistently correlates with the output color green, regardless of what follows it in the sequence.)",0.9,171,dax
"dax -> meaning. Rule: The word ""dax"" seems to correspond to the color green whenever it is mentioned. The word that follows ""dax"" determines the sequence of subsequent colors. If ""dax"" precedes a word that has not been associated with a specific color sequence, then it (dax) is followed by green. If ""dax"" is followed by a word that has been associated with red or yellow in a previous sequence, the corresponding color follows the occurrence of ""dax"".",0.8,171,dax
"Based on the provided examples, I will try to deduce the general rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"". To do this, I will look at the input and corresponding output to see if there is a pattern.

1. ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""
2. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
3. ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""
4. ""wif zup walm dax zup"" -> ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow""
5. ""dax walm wif bluf"" -> ""green green green red red""

From these examples, we can try to find a pattern:

- In examples 1 and 3, the word ""dax"" appears at the beginning of the input and is followed by a ""green"" in the output.
- In example 4, ""dax"" appears towards the end and is also followed by ""green"" in the output.
- In all instances where ""dax"" is present, regardless of its position in the input string, the corresponding output is ""green"".

Now let us look at the other words:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when preceded by ""dax"", but also when not preceded by ""dax"" (examples 1 and 4).
- ""walm"" corresponds to three ""greens"" when following ""dax"" (example 2) and to one ""yellow"" when not following ""dax"" (example 4).
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" when following ""dax"" (examples 3 and 5) but to ""red"" as well, even when not following ""dax"" (example 4).

Looking at the above observations, it seems that ""dax"" might indicate a color change for the word that immediately follows it. To be more specific:

- When ""dax"" comes before ""walm,"" the color turns from yellow to green.
- When ""dax"" comes before ""wif,"" the color remains red, indicating that ""dax"" does not have an effect in this specific case.

Given that ""dax"" itself always corresponds to ""green"" in the output, the general rule could be:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.

However, the examples provided do not show a consistent transformation rule when ""dax"" is followed by other words, except that ""dax"" appears to convert ""walm"" from yellow to green when it immediately follows. For ""wif,"" the color remains the same regardless of the presence of ""dax"".",0.7,171,dax

"Based on the examples given, zup translates to yellow consistently regardless of where it appears in the sequence. Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" means ""yellow.""",1.0,171,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can make the following observations:

- Whenever the word ""zup"" is mentioned alone, the output is ""yellow.""
  
- If ""zup"" is followed by the word ""wif,"" ""red"" comes after ""yellow"" in the output.

- When ""zup"" precedes the word ""lug,"" ""blue"" comes after ""yellow"" in the output.

- If ""zup"" is surrounded by other words, such as in the phrase ""zup wif bluf zup,"" we have ""yellow"" in the positions corresponding to ""zup"" and the colors that follow correlate with the words between them.

- ""zup lug zup lug wif"" maps to ""yellow blue yellow blue red,"" suggesting that each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the words following ""zup"" have a consistent color output (""lug"" -> ""blue,"" ""wif"" -> ""red"").

Considering these observations, we can induce the rule that the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" consistently, regardless of its position or the words around it.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,171,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the rule that zup follows seems to be independent of context and consistent across examples. Each time zup is used, the output includes the color yellow. Therefore, it can be reasonably deduced that the word zup translates to the color yellow.

"Based on the inputs and corresponding outputs provided, each word on the input side corresponds to one or more colors on the output side. The outputs seem to be consistent whenever the same input word is used. The nonce word ""bluf"" appears in each input, and its corresponding output is always a repetition of the color that came before it. 

For example, the second word in each input string corresponds with ""yellow,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""zup""(which outputs yellow), the next word in the output is ""yellow."" Similarly, when the word before ""bluf"" is ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" the output of ""bluf"" is ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be: repeat the color of the previous word.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the previous word.",1.0,171,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at how it translates in the given outputs across the examples:

1. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green
2. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
3. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
4. lug bluf -> blue blue
5. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red

Analyzing the occurrences of ""bluf,"" we can draw several observations:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the output color is repeated at least once subsequent to its first appearance.
- The color that is repeated is always the color that was translated just before the occurrence of ""bluf.""
- The number of repetitions after ""bluf"" is related to the number of input words after ""bluf,"" including itself.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

bluf -> Repeat the most recently mentioned color, the repetition occurring as often as there are terms including and following ""bluf"" in the input sequence.

Rule: ""bluf"" results in duplication of the most recently output color for N times, where N is the number of terms in the input sequence from ""bluf"" onwards.",1.0,171,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, bluf corresponds to repeated colors. The color it corresponds to is the color mentioned before it in the input. It can be seen that bluf duplicates the preceding color in the sequence for the output, as shown in the examples:

- In ""lug zup bluf dax"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"". Thus, ""bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"".
- In ""zup bluf wif walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", duplicating the ""yellow"" color. After that, ""wif"" produces one ""red"", and ""walm"" produces three ""red"".
- In ""zup dax bluf"", ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"", so ""bluf"" duplicates ""green"".
- In ""lug bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"", so ""bluf"" duplicates ""blue"".
- In ""lug walm wif bluf"", ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"", so ""bluf"" duplicates ""red"".

Therefore, the general rule we can induce is:

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,171,bluf
"bluf -> repeated color. The color repeated is that of the word preceding bluf. 

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color associated with the word that comes directly before it in the sequence.",1.0,171,bluf
"bluf -> rule: Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding bluf, maintaining the quantity corresponding to the word immediately following bluf, if available. If no word follows bluf, repeat the color once.

Rule examples:

- ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> yellow yellow red red red (bluf repeats the color for 'zup', which is yellow, twice because 'wif' corresponds to red and 'walm' to red red)
- ""zup dax bluf"" -> yellow green green (bluf repeats the color for 'dax', which is green, once because there is no following word)
- ""lug bluf"" -> blue blue (bluf repeats the color for 'lug', which is blue, once because there is no following word)
- ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> blue blue blue red red (bluf repeats the color for 'wif', which is red, twice because 'walm' corresponds to red red)",0.8,171,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the meaning of ""walm"" seems to be tied to the repetition of the last color mentioned before it. Here is the rule:

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the last mentioned color until a new color word is introduced.

Here are the breakdowns for each example to illustrate the rule:

1. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   Explanation: Before ""walm"" is ""dax"", which corresponds to green, so ""walm"" repeats green.

2. Input: lug walm

   Explanation: Before ""walm"" is ""lug"", which corresponds to blue, so ""walm"" repeats blue.

3. Input: lug wif dax zup walm

4. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   Explanation: Before ""walm"" is ""wif"", which corresponds to red, so ""walm"" repeats red.

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Explanation: Before ""walm"" is ""wif"", which corresponds to red, so ""walm"" repeats red.

Therefore:
walm -> Repeat the last mentioned color until a new color word is introduced.",1.0,171,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", we need to correlate the instances where ""walm"" appears in the input with the specific color pattern that emerges in the output. Here, we look for what is consistent in the output every time ""walm"" appears in the input examples.

Looking closely at the given examples:

1. When the input ""zup dax walm zup wif"" is provided, the output is ""yellow green green green yellow red"". The word ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow"", however, ""walm"" corresponds to a repeated color ""green"".

2. In the input ""lug walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue"". Here again, ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of the word ""lug"" which translates to ""blue"".

3. For the input ""lug wif dax zup walm"", the output is ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color ""yellow"" which is derived from ""zup"".

4. If we look at the input ""zup wif walm lug"", the output is ""yellow red red red blue"". The ""walm"" word appears after ""wif"", and before ""lug,"" translating to a triple repetition of ""red"".

5. Finally, the input ""zup wif walm"" provides the output ""yellow red red red"". Here, ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color ""red"" which corresponds to ""wif"".

From these observations, we can infer a rule that ""walm"" corresponds to the triplet repetition of the color that is directly before it.

Rule: walm -> Triple repetition of the preceding color.",1.0,171,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" affects the output color sequence. The pattern indicates that when ""walm"" is present, the ensuing color words repeat the color immediately before ""walm"". In other words, the word following ""walm"" is excluded, and the word before ""walm"" is repeated in the sequence of colors for the number of times that would correlate to the position of ""walm"" and the following word.

To demonstrate this, consider these points from the examples:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which maps to green), and the output is three greens, meaning ""walm"" caused ""green"" to repeat twice.
2. In the second example, the word ""lug"" is before ""walm"", and ""blue"" is the output three times, repeating due to ""walm"".
3. In the third example, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" (yellow), leading to a repetition of ""yellow"" twice.
4. The fourth and fifth examples also show this repeating pattern due to the presence of ""walm"".

We can thus propose the possible general rule for the nonce word ""walm"": 

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color word before ""walm"" in the output, excluding the word after ""walm"" and mapping the word before ""walm"" into its corresponding color, the number of times depending on ""walm""'s position.",0.8,171,walm
"To deduce the rule or meaning behind the nonce word ""walm,"" let's compare the outputs of the given inputs while focusing on the position of ""walm"" and the colors that correspond to it.

In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup,"" and the colors are ""green green."" In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the color is ""blue."" However, in this case, ""walm"" is repeated three times. In the third example, ""walm"" is at the end after ""zup"" and the colors are ""yellow yellow yellow."" In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug,"" and the colors are ""red red red blue."" Lastly, in the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the colors are ""red red red.""

From observing these examples, we can infer that ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of the color that immediately precedes it. When ""lug"" (which corresponds to blue) is followed by ""walm,"" the color blue is repeated three times. Similarly, when ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the color red is repeated (for as many times as ""walm"" follows ""wif""). The same happens with ""zup"" leading to a repetition of yellow, and with ""dax"" leading to a repetition of green.

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. ""Walm"" causes the color word that directly precedes it to be repeated for as many ""walm"" words that follow.",0.8,171,walm
"According to the given examples, we can look for patterns that determine the output for each word, especially focusing on the word ""walm.""

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red
Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" and the output is green.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output is blue.

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
Here, ""walm"" is at the end, following ""zup,"" and the output is yellow.

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and is followed by ""lug,"" and the output for ""walm"" is red.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" without any word following it, and the output is red.

Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" changes its output color based on the word either preceding or following it. Specifically, it seems to take the output color of the word immediately following it. If there is no word following it, the output color for ""walm"" matches the word that precedes it.

Let's verify this with the examples:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" (output color yellow), and the output color for ""walm"" is green, which does not match this rule.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (output color blue) and is not followed by another word, so its color is blue, which matches the rule.
- In the third example, ""walm"" is at the end, and it takes the output color of ""zup"" (yellow), which precedes it, matching the rule.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" (output color blue), but the output for ""walm"" is red, not matching the rule.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is at the end, following ""wif"" (output color red), and its color is red, matching the rule.

From the inconsistent pattern where ""walm"" sometimes matches the preceding color and other times the following one, it is difficult to establish a solid rule. However, a possible rule could be:

Rule: ""walm"" changes its output color based on a specific rule involving its position and neighboring words. When it comes at the end, its color matches the previous word. When not at the end, the pattern is not concretely determined by the provided examples.

Based on the inconsistencies, we need either a more complex rule to account for all instances or additional examples to establish an accurate rule for ""walm."" As it stands, it appears that the rule may involve more than just the position of ""walm"" in the sequence, potentially also being affected by the sequence's overall composition.

Here is the observed pattern:

- Every time ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" appears in the output.
- The appearance of ""dax"" does not require context from other words to be associated with ""green.""

Thus, the rule is:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, ""green"" is the output.

"Based on the given examples, it appears that each nonce word translates to a specific color. To determine the meaning of the word ""wif,"" we can look at how it's used in different contexts:

- In the first example, ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red,"" indicating that:
  - ""lug"" could mean ""blue,"" and it appears once before and once after ""wif,"" probably affecting the number of times ""red"" is repeated.
  - ""walm"" also seems to trigger a repetition of ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif dax zup dax"" translates to ""red green yellow green,"" which shows:
  - ""wif"" again translates to ""red.""
  - ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and doesn't appear to affect the number of times ""red"" is repeated since ""wif"" stands alone as ""red.""
  - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue,"" which further suggests:
  - ""lug"" by itself means ""blue,"" but when it appears in pairs around ""wif,"" it may cause a doubling effect of the colors that follow.
  - ""walm"" isn't followed by ""red"" here, possibly because the effect of ""lug"" takes precedence, doubling the ""blue"" instead.
  - ""bluf"" likely means ""blue,"" and the repetition is due to the preceding ""lug.""
- The fifth example reinforces the previous findings, with ""lug wif walm"" translating to ""blue red red red"" again, consistently with the second example.

Thus, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to ""red."" The number of times ""red"" is repeated may be affected by the presence of the words ""lug"" and ""walm,"" which seem to cause repetition in the colors that follow them. However, the basic meaning of ""wif"" on its own is simply ""red.""",1.0,172,wif

- When the input is just ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- When ""wif"" appears with ""lug"" and ""walm,"" such as ""lug wif walm,"" the corresponding output is ""blue red red red."" Here, it is notable to see that ""wif"" is once again mapped to ""red,"" ""lug"" is consistently mapped to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to produce a repeated ""red"" as well.
- In the input ""wif dax zup dax,"" ""wif"" produces ""red,"" ""dax"" produces ""green,"" and ""zup"" produces ""yellow."" This consistent use supports the idea that ""wif"" means ""red.""
- In ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" ""lug"" produces ""blue,"" ""wif"" produces ""red,"" and ""bluf"" seems to produce ""blue,"" likely with repetition in a pattern similar to ""lug"" and ""walm.""
- The last example, ""lug wif walm,"" repeats the pattern of ""lug"" and ""walm,"" reinforcing their respective outputs of ""blue"" and ""red,"" with ""wif"" once again resulting in ""red.""

Given the consistent association throughout the examples, we can deduce the following rule:

- The word ""walm"" produces ""red"", and it also appears to double the output.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"", and it seems to double the output.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"", regardless of its position in the input. ""Lug"", ""walm"", and ""bluf"" not only translate to a color but also double that color in the output. 

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,172,wif

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times. This could indicate that ""walm"" might mean ""repeat the previous color three times,"" although further examples would be needed to confirm this.
- When ""lug"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow blue."" This suggests ""lug"" could correspond to the color ""blue.""
- When ""dax"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow green,"" implying that ""dax"" might mean ""green.""

"In the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to affect not only the word immediately preceding or succeeding it but extends its influence to multiple words, resulting in a repetition of the color for a determined amount of times. 

For instance, in the first example:

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

The sequence ""wif walm lug"" results in ""red red red blue,"" where ""walm"" leads to the repetition of ""red"" three times before proceeding to the next color ""blue"" associated with ""lug.""

Similarly, in the second example:

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow

""wif walm lug"" produces ""red red red blue."" Here again, ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times.

Furthermore, in the third and fourth examples:

Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

""walm"" causes the preceding color word, ""zup"" in the third example and ""lug"" in the fourth example, to be repeated three times before changing to the next color associated with the following word.

Finally, in the fifth example:

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

""walm"" alone after ""dax"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color word that precedes it to be repeated three times before the sequence continues.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times.",1.0,172,walm
"Based on the examples provided and the respective outputs, it appears that the presence of the word ""walm"" causes the following word to be repeated multiple times in the color that corresponds to it. Here's how the rule seems to work with the given examples:

1. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   - Here, ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and when ""walm"" is before it, ""lug"" is repeated three times as ""red red red"".

2. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times. 

3. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times before ""green"".

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" triggers a repetition of ""blue"" three times.

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" immediately after ""dax"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the next word's corresponding color to be repeated three times.

So, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" precedes a word, the output will repeat the corresponding color of the following word three times.",1.0,172,walm
"From the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" is a rule that repeats the most recent color mentioned in the output. To confirm this, let's observe each example:

1. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   After the word ""wif"" (which means red), ""walm"" repeats the color red.

2. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   After the word ""wif"" (which means red), ""walm"" repeats the color red again.

3. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   After the word ""zup"" (which means yellow), ""walm"" repeats the color yellow.

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   After the word ""lug"" (which means blue), ""walm"" repeats the color blue.

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   After ""dax"" which means green, ""walm"" repeats the color green; since ""walm"" is right after ""dax"", it causes a repeat of the initial color green.

The rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color that was most recently stated in the output. So ""walm"" doesn't have a color associated directly with it, instead, it is context-dependent.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the most recent color mentioned in the output.",1.0,172,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before 'walm' in the sequence.

Examples to support the rule:
- In the first example, ""lug"" comes before ""walm"" and ""lug"" is associated with the color blue; thus ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""wif"" comes before ""walm"" and ""wif"" is associated with the color red; thus ""walm"" results in ""red"" repeating three times.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""dax"" is associated with the color green; thus ""walm"" leads to ""green"" being repeated three times.
- In the fifth example, since ""dax"" is the only word before ""walm"" and since ""dax"" correlates with green, ""walm"" results in green being repeated for the entire output.",1.0,172,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the context in which it appears and the corresponding outputs.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue
Here, the word ""walm"" precedes ""lug,"" and the output is ""red red red blue,"" where ""red"" occurs three times before ""blue.""

2. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow
Again, ""walm"" precedes ""lug,"" and the output is ""red red red blue.""

3. zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green
Here, ""walm"" comes between ""zup"" and ""dax,"" and the output for ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

4. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue.""

5. dax walm -> green green green
Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green green.""

From these examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the successive repetition of the color associated with the word that follows ""walm."" Specifically, the color corresponding to the next word is repeated three times.

Thus, we can infer the following rule:

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns in the given examples:

- In the first example, ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red."" Since ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" it is clear that ""bluf"" also translates to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" corresponds to ""red red green green green."" Here, we already know ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""dax"" is ""green."" Given that ""wif bluf"" both translate to ""red red,"" ""bluf"" apparently maintains its meaning of ""red,"" while ""walm"" introduces a new color — specifically translating to ""green"" repeated three times.
- The third example, ""lug bluf,"" translates to ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" means ""blue"" and that ""bluf"" also means ""blue"" in this context. This seems contradicting since we've previously determined ""bluf"" to mean ""red."" This suggests that the meaning of ""bluf"" might depend on context.
- In the fourth example, ""zup lug bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue blue."" Here, we already know ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and previously we saw ""lug"" is ""blue."" Since ""lug bluf"" turns to ""blue blue,"" it again suggests that ""bluf"" means ""blue"" when following ""lug.""
- The fifth example, ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax,"" corresponds to ""green blue yellow red red green."" We notice ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" and translates to ""red."" This further reinforces that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when it follows ""wif.""
  
Considering the above observations:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it translates to ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it translates to ""red.""

Thus, ""bluf"" changes its meaning based on the word that precedes it. Here are the two rules that we can determine:

- If the preceding word is ""lug,"" then ""bluf"" means ""blue.""
- If the preceding word is ""wif,"" then ""bluf"" means ""red.""

Rule: ""bluf"" means ""blue"" when it follows ""lug"" and ""red"" when it follows ""wif.""",1.0,173,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the pattern of colors in the output corresponding to the input words, especially focusing on the part where ""bluf"" is involved:

1. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
2. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
3. lug bluf -> blue blue
4. zup lug bluf -> yellow blue blue
5. dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green

It appears that the word ""bluf"" causes the color that comes before it to repeat. Specifically, the color represented by the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" is the color that is duplicated. Let's test this hypothesis:

1. ""wif"" corresponds to red, followed by ""bluf,"" resulting in red repeated (red red).
2. ""lug"" corresponds to blue, followed by ""bluf,"" resulting in blue repeated (blue blue).
3. No word before ""bluf,"" thus there is no repetition.
4. ""lug"" corresponds to blue, followed by ""bluf,"" resulting in blue repeated (yellow blue blue).
5. ""wif"" corresponds to red, followed by ""bluf,"" resulting in red repeated (yellow red red green).

- zup -> yellow

In each instance, regardless of the surrounding words, 'dax' maps directly to 'green.' Therefore, we can deduce that the rule for 'dax' is as follows:

dax -> green. Rule: The word 'dax' corresponds to the color green in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,174,dax
"Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs.

So, dax -> green.",1.0,174,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" triggers the output ""green"" irrespective of its position in the input or the surrounding words. Each of the other non-dax words seems to correspond to a particular color, consistently across examples.

Here's the observed pattern:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
- Whenever ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue.""
- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- Whenever ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""

Given that ""dax"" also outputs ""green"" in all instances, it seems that ""bluf"" and ""dax"" may be synonyms or ""dax"" simply translates to the color ""green."" However, it's important to note that we have only one instance of ""bluf"" in the examples provided, so we can't be entirely sure they have the exact same meaning. Nonetheless, based on the limited information, ""dax"" does indeed correspond to ""green"" consistently.

Hence, the rule is:

dax -> green",1.0,174,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word in the input is associated with a specific color in the output. Here is the association between the words and colors:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> green (which we only see once, but it's directly followed by a green in the output)
- zup -> yellow (which we only see once, but it's directly followed by a yellow in the output)

Analyzing the examples, we can see that every time the word ""dax"" appears, it is followed by ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that precede or follow it. Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" is consistent across all examples.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,174,dax
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently correlates with the output ""green."" By examining the other words, we can observe that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" appears to correspond to ""green"" as well. ""Zup"" seems to be related to ""yellow."" There does not appear to be any additional complexity to the rule based on the order of the words or other variables. Therefore, the rule may be directly about word-to-color association.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,174,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red."" This can be seen when ""wif"" appears alone and when it is in combination with other words. Therefore, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,174,wif
"From the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence. This gives the impression that ""wif"" is an independent unit that maps to the color ""red"" in the output. Each other word in the inputs seems to be associated with its own color as well.

Here's the rule deduced from the given examples:

Rule: wif -> red

This means that whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the same relative position in the output.",1.0,174,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" appears to correspond to the color ""red."" In each instance where ""wif"" appears alone or within a sequence, the word ""wif"" is translated to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,174,wif
"Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be quite straightforward. The nonce word 'wif' consistently corresponds to the output 'red'. There are no instances where 'wif' leads to a different output, so we do not have evidence of it being context-dependent within the provided data. Here's the deduced meaning:

Rule: wif -> red

Meaning of 'wif': The word 'wif' always translates to the color 'red'.",1.0,174,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

From the given examples, whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output always includes the color ""red"".

Therefore, ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".",1.0,174,wif
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the other words present.",1.0,174,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' corresponds to the color yellow regardless of the context it is used in.",1.0,174,zup
"Based on the given examples, ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of the context or the other words around it. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,174,zup
"Based on the examples given, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that surround it.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,174,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" across all examples. Regardless of its position in the input sequence (beginning, middle, or end) and irrespective of the surrounding words, ""zup"" is always converted into ""yellow"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" signifies the color yellow in every instance provided.",1.0,174,zup
"Rule: Based on the examples provided where ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red"" and the consistent appearance of ""red"" each time ""bluf"" appears, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red."" 

Thus, the rule is:
bluf -> red",1.0,174,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" correlates directly with the color ""red."" Whenever the term ""bluf"" is used in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the output. Additionally, the number of times ""bluf"" is mentioned in the input corresponds with the number of times ""red"" is mentioned in the output.

For instance:
- In the first example, ""wif dax bluf,"" the output is ""red green green."" Here, ""wif"" represents ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""bluf"" is also ""red.""
- In the second and fifth examples, ""wif bluf,"" the output is ""red red,"" directly mapping ""wif"" and ""bluf"" to the same color ""red.""
- The third and fourth examples further reinforce this, where ""bluf"" appears in the input, and ""red"" always features in the output.

Rule: bluf -> ""red"" (The word ""bluf"" represents the color ""red"").",1.0,174,bluf
"Rule:
bluf -> red

Explanation:
In every example where ""bluf"" appears, the corresponding output is consistently ""red."" This association remains constant regardless of the position of ""bluf"" within the input sequence or the presence of other words. Therefore, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red.""",1.0,174,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red

Based on the input/output pairs provided, whenever the word 'bluf' appears in the input, the corresponding output includes the color 'red'. Regardless of the other words presented before 'bluf' (such as 'wif', 'lug walm wif', etc.), each instance of 'bluf' corresponds directly to the color 'red' in the output.

This can be confirmed by looking at the second instance of 'wif bluf' which has the same output 'red red' as the first instance, suggesting that 'bluf' consistently corresponds to 'red'. Therefore, the rule can be concluded as the following:

bluf -> red",1.0,174,bluf
"Observing the outputs that correspond to the inputs containing the nonce word ""walm,"" we can attempt to establish a rule for what ""walm"" signifies. Here are the mappings for the colors based on the provided examples:

- ""lug"" seems to map to a single ""blue.""
- ""dax"" seems to map to a single ""green.""
- ""zup"" seems to map to a single ""yellow.""

When ""walm"" is introduced, the output colors increase. Specifically, we see the following:

- In the presence of ""lug walm,"" the output is three ""blue.""
- In the presence of ""dax zup dax walm,"" the output is five ""green.""
- In the presence of ""zup dax walm,"" the output is three ""green.""
- In the presence of ""lug walm zup lug walm,"" the output is three ""blue,"" followed by a single ""yellow,"" and then by three ""blue"" again.
- In the presence of ""dax walm lug,"" the output is three ""green"" followed by a single ""blue.""

It appears that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it three times. Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word (nonce word), it outputs that color word's corresponding color three times. 

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" based on the given context is:
walm -> Repeat the preceding color three times.",1.0,174,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color that comes before it. Specifically, it means to repeat the color word preceding it three times. Here's the reasoning:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""walm"" seems to repeat ""blue"" three times.
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" follows the same rule of triplicating the previous color, in this case, ""green"" from ""dax.""
- The rule holds for further examples involving ""dax"" and ""lug"" followed by ""walm.""

Therefore, based on the patterns observed, the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> Repeat the previous color word three times.
Rule: If a color word is followed by ""walm,"" the output includes that color word three times consecutively.",1.0,174,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and the corresponding outputs to identify patterns:

1. The occurrence of ""lug"" corresponds to a single ""blue"" in the output.
2. The occurrence of ""dax"" corresponds to a single ""green"" in the output.
3. The occurrence of ""zup"" corresponds to a single ""yellow"" in the output.
4. Each instance of ""walm"" in the input corresponds to a series of three outputs that match the color word immediately preceding ""walm"".

With the given examples, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color word immediately before it three times in the output.

Therefore:
walm -> Repeat the previous color word thrice.",1.0,174,walm
"Based on the provided input and output examples, the rule appears to be that the word ""walm"" means repeating the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""walm"" three times. 

In each example, when the word ""walm"" appears, it causes the output to be three repetitions of the color associated with the word before it. ""Lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: If X is the color associated with the word that precedes ""walm,"" then ""walm"" translates to ""X X X"" (X repeated three times).",1.0,174,walm
"From the given examples, one can deduce the following patterns for the nonce word ""walm"":

1. When ""lug walm"" is input, the output is ""blue blue blue"".
2. When ""dax zup dax walm"" is input, the output is ""green yellow green green green"".
3. When ""zup dax walm"" is input, the output is ""yellow green green green"".
4. When ""lug walm zup lug walm"" is input, the output is ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"".
5. When ""dax walm lug"" is input, the output is ""green green green blue"".

Let's break down the outputs by the preceding word:

- ""lug"" alone translates to ""blue"".
- ""dax"" alone translates to ""green"".
- ""zup"" alone translates to ""yellow"".

Now, let's examine the outputs where ""walm"" is included:

- After ""lug walm"" and ""dax walm"", the word ""blue"" or ""green"" is repeated three times, respectively.
- ""walm"" after ""dax zup dax"" adds two extra ""green"".
- ""walm"" after ""zup dax"" adds two extra ""green"".

From this, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word preceding it three times. When the sequence has both ""dax"" and ""zup"" before ""walm"", ""dax"" seems to take precedence, as the color ""green"" associated with ""dax"" is the one that's repeated.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeats the color associated with the word directly preceding it three times. If the preceding word is ""lug"", use ""blue""; if it is ""dax"", use ""green""; if it is ""zup"", use ""yellow"". If there is a sequence of words, the most recent color word takes precedence for the repetition.",0.8,174,walm

"From the provided examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color 'green' in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. The rule seems to be quite straightforward in this case.

The rule can therefore be summarized as:

"Rule: wif means ""red"".",1.0,175,wif

- In the second example (""zup lug zup bluf lug""), ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and is associated with ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" results in another ""yellow.""

- In the fifth example (""dax bluf""), ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and following this pattern, ""bluf"" also results in ""green.""

- When ""dax"" is combined with other words like ""wif"" and ""zup,"" the output for ""dax"" remains ""green"" while the other words produce different colors (wif -> red, zup -> yellow).

4. Input: ""dax"" -> Output: ""green""
5. Input: ""zup dax"" -> Output: ""yellow green""

From the above examples, it appears that the presence of the word ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green"" regardless of its position in the input string.

Additionally, we see that the word ""zup"" precedes the color ""yellow"" when paired with ""dax"" in example 5, which suggests that ""zup"" might independently correspond to ""yellow"". 

However, there is not enough information to definitively conclude what ""wif"" and ""bluf"" mean, as there is not a one-to-one pairing provided like with ""dax"" and ""green"" or ""zup"" and ""yellow"".

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the correlation between its position in the input and the colors in the output:

Input: `zup dax zup dax wif bluf`  
Output: `yellow green yellow green red red`  

Input: `dax wif bluf`  
Output: `green red red`

Input: `zup bluf lug zup`  
Output: `yellow yellow blue yellow`  

Input: `zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug`  
Output: `yellow green green red yellow yellow blue`  

Analyzing the sequences:
- Wherever ""bluf"" appears, the following color in the output is the same as the previous color. 
- 'bluf' doesn't seem to generate a new color but repeats the previously mentioned color.

Based on this information:

Rule: Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, it results in the color immediately before it being repeated in the output.

Therefore:

bluf -> Repeat the previous color mentioned in the output.",1.0,176,bluf
"Given the recurring patterns in the provided input and output sets, it seems that ""bluf"" stands for two different colors based on the preceding word. Noticing this consistent pattern, we can finalize the rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" following ""dax"" translates to ""green red,"" following ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" following ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and following ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" 
If we take ""bluf"" to be a transformation based on the previous word, the rule can be described as:

bluf -> meaning:
- After ""zup,"" bluf means ""yellow.""
- After ""dax,"" bluf means ""green red.""
- After ""wif,"" bluf means ""red.""
- After ""lug,"" bluf means ""blue.""",0.9,176,bluf
"The term ""bluf"" corresponds to a color, as evidenced by its placement in examples where it is output as a color. Let's analyze each instance:

- Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf 
  Output: yellow green yellow green red red
  - Here, ""bluf"" gives two ""red""s, but it's not clear if that's due to ""bluf"" or ""wif.""

- Input: dax wif bluf
  Output: green red red
  - ""bluf"" outputs ""red"" again.
  
- Input: lug bluf wif
  Output: blue blue red
  - ""bluf"" results in an additional ""blue.""

- Input: zup bluf lug zup
  Output: yellow yellow blue yellow
  - In this sequence, ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow,"" but directly before it, ""zup"" outputs ""yellow"" too. ""lug"" after ""bluf"" also outputs ""blue.""

- Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
  Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
  - ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" and results in ""green red,"" but when followed by ""lug,"" the pair results in ""yellow blue.""

Given this information, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word before it. If ""bluf"" is the first word or follows a non-color word, it defaults to ""red.""

Specifically:
zup bluf -> yellow yellow
dax bluf -> green green
lug bluf -> blue blue
wif bluf -> red red (it is assumed from the second context where wif precedes bluf)
bluf at the beginning -> blue

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: Blue if preceded by ""lug,"" ""wif,"" or at the beginning, yellow if preceded by ""zup,"" and green if preceded by ""dax.""",0.8,176,bluf

- After ""zup,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""
- After ""lug,"" ""bluf"" does not appear, but ""lug"" itself translates to ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" it translates to ""red."" 

We can induce a simple rule from the above observations:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is dependent on the word that immediately precedes it. It repeats the color associated with the previous word, except when following ""wif,"" where it always translates to ""red.""

Rule: If ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" or ""dax,"" it takes the color of that word (yellow for ""zup,"" green for ""dax""). If ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it is translated as ""red,"" and ""lug"" is independent, causing no change and translating to ""blue.""",0.8,176,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be associated with repeating the color attributed to the word that precedes it. Let's analyze the examples:

1. wif dax lug walm

- ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" After ""walm"" is introduced, ""blue"" is repeated.

2. lug walm zup lug walm
- Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
- ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm"" there are repeated ""blue"" colors. The same pattern is observed later in the sequence after ""lug"" and ""walm.""

3. dax walm
- Output: green green green
- ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and the color ""green"" is repeated.

4. dax walm
- Output: green green green
- The same pattern as in the previous example where ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"": ""green"" is repeated.

5. dax walm zup lug dax
- Output: green green green yellow blue green
- ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and ""green"" is repeated after ""walm."" The sequence then continues without repetition after new words are introduced.

Rule:
walm -> Causes the color of the word that precedes it to repeat.",1.0,176,walm
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of the word ""walm"" corresponds to multiple occurrences of the word ""blue"" in the output. Moreover, the number of ""blue"" appearances after ""walm"" in the output is consistent with the number of words preceding ""walm"" in the input. For example:

- In the first input, ""wif dax lug walm"" leads to three instances of ""blue"" because there are three words before ""walm.""
- In the second input, ""lug walm zup lug walm,"" each ""walm"" is followed by two instances of ""blue,"" corresponding to the one word ""lug"" that appears before each ""walm.""
- In the third and fourth inputs, ""dax walm"" results in three ""green"" words, which suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" did not produce any ""blue"" because ""dax"" is just one word.
- In the fifth input, ""dax walm zup lug dax,"" only ""walm"" is followed by a single ""blue,"" as there is only one word (""dax"") before it.

From the examples, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" generates a number of ""blue"" words equivalent to the count of words that precede it in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Generates ""blue"" in the output equal to the number of words that precede it in the input sequence.",1.0,176,walm
"From the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color that is encoded by the previous word. We can deduce this because whenever ""walm"" appears, it repeats the color of the word just before it. For example:

- ""dax lug walm"" outputs ""red green blue blue blue,"" here ""walm"" repeated the color translated by ""lug,"" which is blue.
- ""lug walm zup lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue,"" again ""walm"" repeats the colors translated by the words preceding it, in this case, ""lug"" and then ""lug"" again, which both represent blue.
- ""dax walm"" always outputs ""green green green"" where ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is green.
- ""dax walm zup lug dax"" follows the same rule, with ""walm"" repeating the color of ""dax"" and then ""dax"" producing its color green again after ""lug.""

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color translated by the word immediately before it.",1.0,176,walm
"Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm"". Here's how it breaks down:

1. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". After ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated.

2. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   Rule: The first ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"". The second ""lug walm"" also leads to ""blue blue blue"". In between, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". After ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated.

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Rule: Same as above, ""dax"" then ""walm"" leads to ""green green green"".

5. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   Rule: ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""dax"" again to ""green"".

Walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repetition of the color corresponding to the previous word. Rule: If a color word is followed by ""walm"", the output is three instances of that color.",1.0,176,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to prompt the output of repeating the color associated with the preceding word. We can infer the meanings of the other words (""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""zup"") from their corresponding colors:

- ""wif"" is followed by ""red""
- ""dax"" is followed by ""green""
- ""lug"" is followed by ""blue""
- ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow""

The output after ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that comes just before it. Here are the specific rules inferred from each example:

1. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   Rule: ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and repeats ""blue"" three times.

2. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   Rule: ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and repeats ""blue"" twice, then follows ""lug"" again later and repeats ""blue"" three times.

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Rule: ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and repeats ""green"" two additional times.

4. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   Rule: ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and repeats ""green"" two additional times, and the pattern continues as before with other colors after other words.

Based on these examples, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" is encountered in the input, it causes the output to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times in total, including the original color.",0.8,176,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,177,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.",1.0,177,lug
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""lug"" consistently results in the color ""blue."" It does not seem to matter what other words are present or the position of ""lug"" in the sequence; the output is blue wherever ""lug"" appears.

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,177,lug
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the word ""lug"" appears to be consistent regardless of the context or position in the input sequence. Every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue"". Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

lug -> meaning. Rule: When ""lug"" is present in the input, the output is always ""blue"".",1.0,177,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue"".",1.0,177,lug
"Based on the examples, here's the analysis for each instance of ""dax"" and its corresponding color:

- ""dax"" when it follows ""walm"" or ""wif"" or is the first word in the sequence results in ""green.""
- ""dax"" when following itself or another ""dax"" results in ""green"" as well, maintaining the pattern.
- ""dax"" has no instances where it immediately precedes another word while not being the first word, except when it immediately follows another ""dax,"" so we do not have any examples of ""dax"" being anything other than ""green.""

However, there's a direct correlation in every instance with ""dax"" being ""green"" despite the surrounding words. This may indicate that ""dax"" is independent of its surrounding context or that there's not enough variety in the examples given to conclusively prove context dependence. It's worth noting there are no cases provided where ""dax"" produces a different result.

Given this information, the deduced rule is as follows:

Rule: ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green,"" with no variation regardless of its position or surrounding words.

Thus, dax -> green.",1.0,177,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's start by looking for patterns in the examples provided.

Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding output. This gives us an initial hypothesis that ""dax"" could map to ""green."" However, we need to confirm if there are any more specific rules by comparing across different contexts.

In the first input, ""dax"" is surrounded by the word ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output. Despite the surrounding ""zup,"" the word ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green.""

In the second input, ""dax"" is followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" but ""dax"" itself still corresponds to ""green.""

The third input gives us ""dax lug,"" which translates to ""green blue."" As ""lug"" is different in this context, the output for ""dax"" is still ""green,"" confirming that the word around ""dax"" doesn't affect its translation to ""green.""

The fourth input shows ""dax"" followed by ""wif"" and then ""dax"" again, with the output being ""green red green,"" which further fuels the hypothesis that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" regardless of its position.

The fifth input has two instances of ""dax"" with a ""walm"" between them, and the corresponding output is ""green green green red green."" Since ""walm"" in the middle still corresponds to ""green"" and doesn’t affect the output for ""dax,"" it suggests that ""dax"" has a consistent translation to ""green,"" and ""walm"" might in this context carry the same meaning.

Considering these observations, there doesn't appear to be a situation where ""dax"" corresponds to anything other than ""green."" Therefore, we can deduce that the consistent rule is that ""dax"" directly maps to the color ""green,"" independent of its position or the words around it.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,177,dax
"From the examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to a particular color based on its position relative to other words or perhaps the context within the sequence. Let's analyze the data:

1. In the first example, ""dax"" is surrounded by the word ""zup"" and translates to ""green""
2. In the second example, ""dax"" follows ""wif"" and translates to ""green""
3. In the third example, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"" and it translates to ""green""
4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" appears both at the beginning and after ""wif,"" translating to ""green"" both times
5. In the fifth example, ""dax"" appears at the beginning, between ""walm"" and ""wif,"" and at the end, translating to ""green"" each time

Based on these observations, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" irrespective of its position or the words around it. So the rule here appears to be:

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of context or position within the sequence.

Therefore: dax -> green",1.0,177,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the nonce word ""dax"" transforms to ""green"" when it is the output.

Here are the observations:
- Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the same position.
- Other words correspond to different colors (for example: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"").
- The output color does not depend on the position of the word in the sequence but rather the specific word itself.

Therefore, the rule is as follows:
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output regardless of its position or surrounding words in the input.",1.0,177,dax
"To determine the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"", we can observe the various inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""wif zup walm dax zup"" -> ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow""
2. ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red green red red""
3. ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue""
4. ""dax wif dax"" -> ""green red green""
5. ""dax walm wif dax"" -> ""green green green red green""

Looking at each example:

- In example 4, the use of ""dax"" in between ""wif"" changes the output to green instead of red which follows ""wif"". This suggests ""dax"" might represent ""green"" in some instances.
- In example 3, ""dax"" comes before ""lug"", and the output is ""green blue"". Since we don't see ""lug"" in any other examples, we cannot definitively say what color ""lug"" should translate to, but ""dax"" still results in ""green"".

Now examining when ""dax"" does not result in ""green"":

- In example 1, ""dax"" comes after ""walm"", which has a corresponding color of ""yellow"", and before ""zup"" that also has the corresponding color ""yellow"". However, in this instance, ""dax"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- The same situation occurs in example 5 where ""dax"" comes after ""walm"" but before ""wif"" with the colors ""green"" and ""red"". However, unlike example 1, here ""dax"" remains ""green"".

Through comparison, particularly when looking at example 2, ""dax"" output is ""green"" when it follows ""wif"", and in other cases, it follows the color of the preceding word, if the preceding word is not ""wif"".

So, we can deduce that ""dax"" is context-dependent:

- When ""dax"" follows ""wif"", the color is ""green"".
- When ""dax"" precedes ""wif"", the color is also ""green"".
- When ""dax"" follows any other word (except for ""wif""), the color is that of the preceding word.
- There is not enough information to deduce the color when ""dax"" precedes any other word (except for ""wif""), as there are no examples provided for such a scenario.

Rule: dax -> If preceded or followed by ""wif"", the color is ""green"". If preceding any other word (with no example for this), the scenario is unspecified. If followed by any other word except ""wif"", the color is that of the preceding word.",0.8,177,dax
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,177,wif
"Based on the examples provided:

- In the first example, ""wif lug walm"" results in ""red blue blue blue"". When comparing it to the fourth example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"", which results in ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"", it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"", and ""walm"" is ""blue blue"" or ""yellow yellow"", depending on its position or perhaps the word it follows.

- In the second example, ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red"", and in the third example, ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow"". This suggests that ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and the position of ""wif"" relative to ""zup"" doesn't change the corresponding colors for these words.

- In the fourth example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"", we see ""lug"" as ""blue"" and ""dax"" as ""green"" again. ""Zup"" is ""yellow"" as established, but ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow"" following ""zup"", which differs from the first example where ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and is ""blue blue"".

- The fifth example, ""dax zup wif"", becomes ""green yellow red"". We can confirm ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow"" here too.

By these observations:
- ""lug"" always translates to ""blue"".
- ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" always translates to ""green"".
- The word ""wif"" precedes a color change but it itself seems consistently associated to ""red"".

Therefore, we can deduce that ""wif"" translates to ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,177,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red."" Each instance of ""wif"" in the Input maps to ""red"" in the Output, regardless of the position or the surrounding words.

So, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,177,wif
"From the given examples, we can try to induce the meaning of the word ""wif"" based on its relationship with the output colors. Here's the analysis:

1. In examples where ""wif"" is immediately followed by ""zup"" or preceded by ""zup,"" the output color for ""wif"" is always red, and for ""zup"" it is always yellow. 
2. In the example where ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output color for ""wif"" is still red, and for ""lug,"" it is blue. 
3. Regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the sequence (beginning, middle, or end), the output color for ""wif"" remains consistent as red.

Taking these patterns into account, we arrive at the following conclusion:

Rule: wif -> red

"Based on the examples provided, we need to deduce the meaning or rule governing the nonce word ""wif."" Let's examine the instances:

2. ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red,"" which shows that ""wif"" is ""red"" since ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

3. ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow,"" supporting the indication that ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

4. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" translates to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow,"" which also supports the previous conclusion with ""wif"" being ""red.""

5. ""dax zup wif"" translates to ""green yellow red."" ""Wif"" is consistent with ""red,"" and the other words follow previous color patterns established in earlier examples.

bluf -> meaning:
- When preceded by ""zup,"" bluf means ""yellow.""

From these examples, it seems that whenever ""bluf"" is present, the output always contains a double of the color that follows it (e.g., ""bluf"" wif => red red, ""bluf"" lug => blue blue). A pattern is observed that ""bluf"" leads to a duplication of the color word that comes next in the sequence. Therefore, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"" as follows:

- In example 3, ""walm"" appears at the end after two instances of ""wif."" The color red is added twice for ""wif"" before repeating the color prior to it (lug -> blue) three times.
- In example 4, ""walm"" appears twice; first, it follows ""dax"", and green is repeated three times. Then ""wif"" is introduced, followed by ""walm"" again, and the output is red repeated three times, which seems to be a pattern for ""wif"" before ""walm.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" comes after two words, ""dax lug,"" and the output is one green (for dax) followed by three blues (for lug).

The pattern indicates that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the word(s) before it, three times. If ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" it becomes red, regardless of the previous color word. If multiple color words precede ""walm,"" only the immediate one affects the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the immediate preceding word three times. If ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" then the color is red instead. If multiple color words precede ""walm"" without interruption by ""wif,"" the last color word dictates the color to be repeated.",0.8,177,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's consider each example:

1. dax walm -> green green green
2. lug walm -> blue blue blue
3. lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red
4. dax walm wif walm -> green green green red red red
5. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue

Based on the examples above, it seems that the word ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the previous word the same number of times as the color associated with it. For instance:

- In example 1, ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times.
- In example 2, ""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.
- In example 3 and 4, ""wif"" is associated with red, and ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times.
- In example 5, when ""dax lug"" is given, ""dax"" is associated with green, ""lug"" is associated with blue, but ""walm"" only repeats ""blue"" (from ""lug""), ignoring ""green.""

So we can deduce the general rule for ""walm,"" which is:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding non-""walm"" word the same number of times as that color has appeared in the list directly before ""walm"".

Rule: If ""x"" is a word immediately preceding ""walm"" and the output for ""x"" is ""color,"" then ""walm"" transforms into ""color color color"" (assuming ""color"" appeared three times consecutively before ""walm""; adjust the quantity respectively if the pattern is different).",0.8,177,walm

"Based on the input-output pairs provided, we can deduce the following:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears alone or within a sequence, the output is always ""green.""
- There are no counter examples to contradict the direct correlation between ""dax"" and ""green.""

Given this consistency across all examples, the rule is:

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color green, independent of its position in the sequence.",1.0,178,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided. Let's analyze the occurrences of ""wif"" and their corresponding output colors:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   - ""wif"" appears first and translates to ""red.""

2. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red
   - ""wif"" appears in the second position, and again, it translates to ""red.""

3. Input: wif zup bluf
   Output: red yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" is in the first position, and the corresponding output is ""red.""

4. Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
   - ""wif"" is the last word, and it corresponds to ""red.""

5. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   - ""wif"" appears in the third and fifth positions, and in both cases, it equates to ""red.""

From these patterns, it appears that regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input, it consistently corresponds to ""red"" in the output. The position does not influence its output color.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,178,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif"", let's examine its output in every example given:

1. wif walm dax -> red red red green
2. dax wif bluf -> green red red
3. wif zup bluf -> red yellow yellow
4. zup lug bluf zup bluf wif -> yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
5. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue

Now, let's look for patterns regarding the position of ""wif"" and its corresponding output color:

- In examples 1 and 3, ""wif"" comes first and the output is red.
- In example 2, ""wif"" is in the middle and the output is red.
- In examples 4 and 5, ""wif"" is at the end, once and twice respectively, and the output is red each time.

Based on these observations, we can rule out the position as a factor for the color output. Now let's check if the presence of specific words before or after ""wif"" changes the output:

- ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and follows ""bluf""; in both cases, the color is red for ""wif"".
- ""wif"" follows ""dax"" and ""lug""; the color is still red for ""wif"".

There aren't any words that consistently precede or follow ""wif"", yet ""wif"" always results in the color red regardless of its position or neighboring words.

Given the examples and the analysis, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color red, irrespective of its position or the context within the sequence of words.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,178,wif
"Based on the given examples, it looks like ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Let's examine the evidence:

- In the first example, ""wif"" appears alongside ""walm"" and ""dax,"" with the output showing three reds and one green. Since ""dax"" appears in the second input without an associated red in the output, ""dax"" likely corresponds to ""green,"" while ""walm"" is uncertain.

- In the second example, ""wif"" again appears with ""dax"" but also with ""bluf."" The output is two reds and a green. Given the previous example where ""dax"" correlated with green, this reinforces that ""wif"" is red and ""bluf"" is now uncertain.

- The third example features ""wif"" with ""zup"" and ""bluf,"" rendering an output of red, yellow, and yellow. ""Bluf"" can't be red since ""wif"" is already associated with red, so ""zup"" must be yellow here, making ""wif"" consistently appearing with red in the output.

- The fourth example is more complex with multiple repeats but focusing on the occurrences of ""wif,"" which is the last word prior to the last color ""red.""

- In the fifth example, ""wif"" appears three times and each time it is followed by ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""",1.0,178,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" In each input example where ""wif"" is present, ""red"" appears in the output at the same position.

To confirm, let's examine the contexts:

- Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green
   ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and ""walm"" is also associated with ""red"" in this instance.

- Input: dax wif bluf -> Output: green red red
   ""wif"" is again associated with ""red.""

- Input: wif zup bluf -> Output: red yellow yellow
   ""wif"" is associated with ""red"" once more.

- Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif -> Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
   ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" following the same pattern.

- Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   ""wif"" is once again associated with ""red,"" reinforcing the pattern.

Rule:
wif -> red",1.0,178,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, except when it follows the word ""bluf."" Therefore, the rule appears to be: 

Rule: ""wif"" generally corresponds to the color red, but when it directly follows the word ""bluf,"" it corresponds to the color red.

Therefore, my answer is:

wif -> red (general rule with an exception following the word ""bluf"")",0.0,178,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is: zup -> yellow.",1.0,178,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following:

- In the first example, ""zup"" is paired with the word ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" is placed before ""wif"" and still produces ""yellow"" and then ""red.""
- In the third and fourth examples, ""zup"" on its own or followed by ""walm"" results in ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" is preceded by ""wif"" and gives ""yellow"" and ""red"" in that order.

From these examples, we can deduce that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" irrespective of other words' positions or presence. Other words appear to correspond to different colors, but ""zup"" remains unchanged in each instance.

The rule is:

zup -> yellow",1.0,178,zup

"It appears that the nonce word ""walm"" is responsible for triplicating the color associated with the word that precedes it. Based on the provided examples, the word before ""walm"" corresponds to a specific color—“dax” is to green, and “zup” is to yellow. When ""walm"" follows either ""dax"" or ""zup"", the output is that color repeated three times.

However, in the example ""lug walm wif bluf"", the output is ""blue blue blue red red"", with ""lug"" preceding ""walm"" and ""bluf"" at the end. This is an inconsistency if we consider ""walm"" as a tripler because it should not affect the word ""bluf"" that follows it. But we can assume that ""lug"" might be converted to blue and then triplicated due to ""walm"", and ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red"", although there's not enough data to securely define the transformation rules for ""wif"" or ""bluf"".

To correctly define ""walm,"" we will disregard the example with ""lug walm wif bluf"" as it might contain additional rules not associated with ""walm"" directly or there might not be sufficient information to accurately describe its transformation.

Given the available information and ignoring the irregular example, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Walm -> meaning: The term ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated three times.",0.8,178,walm
"Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to correspond with the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, repeated three times. The word before ""walm"" is being translated to its color equivalent, and then that color is being output in triplicate. Here are the breakdowns:

- In ""dax walm,"" the word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the output is ""green green green.""
- In ""lug walm wif bluf,"" ""lug"" is translated as ""blue,"" and thus we get ""blue blue blue"" followed by ""wif bluf,"" which corresponds to ""red red.""
- In ""zup wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow red red red,"" where ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" so it results in ""red red red"" as the output.
- In ""dax walm,"" it repeats the earlier example with ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" producing ""green green green.""
- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and ""walm"" repeats this color to make ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> meaning. Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.",0.8,178,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the rule appears as follows: 

When ""walm"" is preceded by another word, the output is three repetitions of the color associated with the preceding word. When ""walm"" is followed by a different word (""wif"" in the given examples), the output changes to a sequence of the color associated with ""walm"" followed by the color associated with the following word, repeated twice. 

In the given examples, ""dax"" consistently leads to the color green and ""zup"" consistently leads to the color yellow. However, ""walm"" seems to take on the color of the word before it. When ""walm"" is not preceded by another word (as in the third example), it defaults to red (as indicated by the color red appearing twice after ""wif"" and once before ""wif"").

Hence, the rule appears to be: 

walm -> When standalone or following another word, translates to ""red"". When preceded by another word, it repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Additionally, other words in the examples seem to correspond with other colors (e.g., ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" ""bluf"" with ""green,"" ""lug"" with ""blue""). However, ""wif"" consistently appears to relate only to the color red, irrespective of its position or the context within the sequence.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look at the context it appears in within each example and the corresponding output:

- In the first example, the presence of ""wif"" results in the output of ""red red"" followed by colors that match the other words in the sequence (e.g., ""walm"" -> ""yellow yellow"").
- In the second example, ""wif"" immediately results in ""red red"" followed by ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and it is not repeated even though the next word ""lug"" is repeated and results in ""blue blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red,"" even though the next word ""bluf"" results in ""green green.""
- In the last example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" which is not influenced by the word ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green.""

From these observations, we can conclude that ""wif"" consistently results in the output of ""red,"" regardless of its position or the words around it.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,179,wif

1. When ""wif"" appears at the beginning of the sequence, it translates to ""red"".
2. When ""wif"" appears in the middle of a sequence, it still translates to ""red"".
3. Regardless of what comes before or after ""wif"", the output for ""wif"" is consistently ""red"".

By comparing these examples, we can see that ""bluf"" is consistently followed by a color that repeats the last color mentioned. The word that comes right after ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word right before ""bluf.""

Formulating the rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> The color that follows ""bluf"" in the output replicates the color that precedes ""bluf"" in the input.

1. ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and corresponds to ""blue,"" thus ""bluf"" produces another ""yellow"" in the output.
2. ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and corresponds to ""red,"" thus ""bluf"" produces another ""red"" in the output.
3. ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and corresponds to ""blue,"" thus ""bluf"" produces another ""blue"" in the output.
4. ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and the corresponding color is ""yellow,"" thus ""bluf"" produces another ""yellow"" in the output.
5. ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and the corresponding color is ""green,"" thus ""bluf"" produces another ""green"" in the output.

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the given input and output pairs.

1. Wherever ""walm"" appears in the input, the color in the output immediately preceding and following ""walm"" is the same except for the case where ""walm"" is the last word.

2. The color corresponding to ""walm"" always seems to be the same as the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Let’s apply this analysis to each example:

Example 1:
- Input: lug zup walm lug
- Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color yellow, and ""walm"" becomes yellow too. Then we have another ""lug"" after ""walm,"" which is blue, so it seems like ""walm"" is repeating the color of the preceding word.

Example 2:
- Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
- Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

Again, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" (yellow), and the output color for ""walm"" is the same yellow. ""Lug"" follows ""walm"" and is blue.

Example 3:
- Input: lug dax walm
- Output: blue green green green

Here, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, and the output for ""walm"" is also green. Since ""walm"" is the last word, there is no following color to compare it to, but the pattern of repeating the preceding color still holds.

Example 4:
- Input: zup lug walm wif walm
- Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

In this example, ""walm"" is first preceded by ""lug"" (blue) and ""walm"" is blue as well. Then ""walm"" appears again at the end and it still repeats the preceding color, which is ""wif"" (red), even though ""walm"" is at the end.

Example 5:
- Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
- Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

Here, the first ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and becomes blue. The pattern of ""walm"" repeating the preceding color continues throughout.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the immediately preceding word.

Rule: walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color of the word that directly precedes it.",1.0,179,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze how it affects the output across different examples. 

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue at both the start and the end. ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. A single ""walm"" produces three yellows following ""zup.""

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
- Again, ""zup"" is followed by yellow, and ""lug"" results in blue. A single ""walm"" between ""zup"" and ""lug"" leads to two additional yellows. ""wif"" followed by ""bluf"" produces red red.

Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""dax"" to green. ""walm"" following ""dax"" produces two additional greens.

Input: zup lug walm wif walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
- Here ""zup"" and ""lug"" alternate with corresponding yellow and blue. The presence of ""walm"" after ""lug"" generates two additional blues. ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" produces two additional reds.

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
- ""lug"" again is blue, and ""walm"" following ""lug"" creates two additional blues. ""dax"" and ""wif"" retain their previous green and red correspondences, and ""lug"" provides another blue.

From these examples, we can notice a pattern:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which corresponds with yellow), we observe additional yellow colors in the output (two more yellows).
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which corresponds with blue), we notice extra blue colors in the output (two more blues).
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which corresponds with green), more green colors appear in the output (two more greens).

Hence, we can induce that ""walm"" generates two more of the color directly preceding it.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color that precedes it two more times.",1.0,179,walm
"From the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" has the following function:

It repeats the color associated with the noun that comes immediately before it, for as many times as one less than the number of letters in the word ""walm"". Since ""walm"" has four letters, it repeats the previous color three times.

Let's elaborate with each example:

1. lug zup walm lug
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""zup"" to yellow.
   - ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" (yellow) three times.
   - Output: blue yellow [yellow yellow yellow] blue

2. zup walm lug wif bluf
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, ""wif"" to red (appearing twice like ""bluf"").
   - ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" (yellow) three times.
   - Output: yellow [yellow yellow yellow] blue red red

3. lug dax walm
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""dax"" to green.
   - ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"" (green) three times.
   - Output: blue green [green green green]

4. zup lug walm wif walm
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, and ""wif"" to red.
   - The first ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" (blue) three times.
   - The second ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif"" (red) three times.
   - Output: yellow blue [blue blue blue] red [red red red]

5. lug walm dax wif lug wif
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""dax"" to green, and ""wif"" to red.
   - The first ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" (blue) three times.
   - Output: blue [blue blue blue] green red blue red

So, the rule is:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding noun three times.",1.0,179,walm
"Walm -> repeats the color of the previous word. 

Rule: When ""walm"" appears after a word, the color associated with the previous word is repeated.",1.0,179,walm

It seems that whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the same position in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

Other words in the sequence correspond to other specific colors as well; for example, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The color output for ""walm"" is also ""red,"" which suggests that ""walm"" may not affect the meaning of ""wif."" 

From the given examples, we can induce a rule:

"Rule: wif -> red

Each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output.",1.0,180,wif

In the second example, ""wif"" appears after ""lug"" and before ""dax"" the output has ""red"" in the same position. Additionally, ""wif"" appears at the end, and the output ends with ""red.""
In the third example, ""wif"" is at the end and the output ends with ""red.""
In the fourth example, ""wif"" is the only word and it corresponds to three ""red"" in the output.
In the fifth example, ""wif"" appears after ""lug"" and before ""dax"" again, and the output has ""red"" in the corresponding positions both times.

3. wif -> red, zup -> yellow, dax -> green, bluf follows wif -> red
4. dax -> green, bluf follows dax -> green
5. zup -> yellow, lug -> blue, bluf follows zup (as lug repeats without bluf following directly) -> yellow

"Based on the examples provided:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the output color is green.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output color is red.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output color is yellow.

It seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" outputs the same color as the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.",1.0,180,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we observe the patterns in the given examples:

1. When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is green followed by green.
2. When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is red followed by red.
3. When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is yellow followed by yellow.
4. However, when ""bluf"" is not immediately preceded by one of the discussed words, as in the second example ""wif bluf,"" the color is still red followed by red, indicating that this may be a default or independent case.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. If there is no word that directly precedes it that has a corresponding color, then ""bluf"" produces red, suggesting that red may be either a default color or an indication of ""bluf"" itself.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the preceding word or defaults to red if there is no immediately preceding color-associated word.",0.8,180,bluf
"Based on the input-output pairs provided, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here is the analysis:

- In ""dax zup bluf"", the word before ""bluf"" is ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"". The output is ""green yellow yellow"", which means ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" in this context.
- In ""wif bluf"", the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"". The output is ""red red"", indicating ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" in this instance.
- In ""wif zup bluf wif dax"", the word before ""bluf"" is ""zup"", giving us ""yellow"" again. This corresponds with the output ""red yellow yellow red green"", where ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"".
- In ""dax bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", and the output is ""green green"", further supporting that ""bluf"" translates to the color of the word before it, which is ""green"" in this case.

The only instance that doesn't directly follow this pattern is ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"". Here, the output is ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow"", but since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and the pattern suggests that ""bluf"" should match the color of the preceding word, a single occurrence of ""bluf"" after ""zup"" might be a special scenario where it repeats the color associated with the word directly before it, despite an intervening word ""lug"".

Given the evidence so far, the most consistent rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color associated with the word immediately before it. If ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", the presence of ""lug"" might cancel the effect of the second last word, making ""bluf"" default to the color of ""zup"" which seems to be ""yellow.""

Therefore: bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the color of the word that precedes ""bluf."" If the intervening word is ""lug"", the effect of the preceding color word might be nullified.",0.8,180,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to relate to the color that the word preceding it produces. Here's a breakdown of the pattern:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""green green"". This suggests that the word ""bluf"" might be following a rule by which it repeats the color indicated by the previous word.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""red red"", which supports the aforementioned rule.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow"", which also aligns with the pattern.
- The word ""bluf"" does not produce a color on its own, as it is not listed alone in any of the inputs.

Based on this information, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes the color indicated by the word immediately before it and outputs that color again.

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning is to repeat the color output of the preceding word.",0.8,180,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" influences the output by repeating the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. Each instance of ""walm"" mirrors the color of the word that comes right before it, and the number of times the color is repeated is one more than the number of letters in the word ""walm"" (which contains four letters, hence generating three repetitions).

Here's the breakdown of the inference:

- In the first example, ""dax zup dax walm,"" the color before ""walm"" is ""green,"" derived from ""dax,"" and it is repeated three times after ""walm.""

- In the second example, ""wif walm zup walm,"" the color ""red"" obtained from ""wif"" is repeated three times after the first ""walm,"" and the color ""yellow"" obtained from ""zup"" is repeated three times after the second ""walm.""

- In the third example, ""zup walm,"" the color before ""walm"" is ""yellow,"" so it is repeated three times.

- In the fourth example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" the color ""blue"" obtained from ""lug"" is repeated three times after ""walm.""

"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" results in the color mentioned before it being repeated three times in the output. To be more precise:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", ""green"" is repeated three times in the output.
- In the second example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", and ""yellow"" is repeated three times in the output.
- The third example again shows ""zup"" followed by ""walm"", with ""yellow"" being repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and after ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- The fifth example also has ""lug"" before ""walm"", resulting in ""blue"" being repeated three times.

"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to cause the following color to repeat three times. 

In the first example, ""dax zup dax walm"" correlates with ""green yellow green green green,"" where 'green' following 'dax' is repeated three times after 'walm.' 

The second example, ""wif walm zup walm,"" correlates with ""red red red yellow yellow yellow,"" where following 'wif,' 'red' is repeated three times and following 'zup,' 'yellow' is repeated three times after each 'walm.' 

The pattern is consistent across all examples; hence 'walm' appears to cause the color word that appears just before it to repeat three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color word to repeat three times.",1.0,180,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word or set of words. The number of times ""walm"" repeats the color corresponds to the number of times the previous word appears. Here's the analysis:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" meaning walm took the color of ""dax"" which is green and repeated it twice since ""dax"" appeared twice before ""walm.""
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" since ""wif"" is red, and ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating ""walm"" takes the color of ""zup"" and repeats it three times.
- The third example reinforces the interpretation that ""walm"" after ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" being repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" showing that ""walm"" takes the color of the last distinct word ""lug,"" which is blue, and repeats it three times as ""lug"" and ""bluf"" both signify blue and appear three times in total.
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm"" gives us ""blue blue blue"" again, since ""lug"" is blue and appears once before ""walm.""

Therefore, the general rule appears to be:

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,181,lug
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's examine the relationship between the input sequences and their corresponding output colors, looking for patterns that could help us infer a rule.

Here's a breakdown of the provided examples:

- Every time ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" is output.
- The word ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow.""
- The word ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red.""
- The word ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue.""
- The word ""walm"" and ""bluf"" don't have a consistent direct mapping but it appears that ""walm"" is related to ""green"" when followed by ""zup"".

Let's analyze the pattern of ""dax"" specifically:

1. ""dax wif zup dax"" -> ""green red yellow green""
2. ""dax walm zup"" -> ""green green green yellow""
3. ""wif dax lug"" -> ""red green blue""
4. ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow blue yellow yellow""
5. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""

""Dax"" consistently maps to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it. There are no examples where ""dax"" maps to any other color.

Given this information, we can deduce:

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or other context.

Therefore:

dax -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,181,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can try to find the rule by looking at the pattern in which the word ""dax"" appears and its corresponding color in the output.

- In every instance where ""dax"" appears, it is translated to the color ""green"" in the output.
- ""dax"" does not seem to depend on its position in the input sequence to translate to ""green""; it remains consistent regardless of placement.
- Other words correlate with other specific colors, such as ""wif"" with ""red,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue."" This further suggests that ""dax"" consistently relates to ""green"" without a position-dependent or context-dependent rule.

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be:

Rule: dax translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position or the context in which it is used within the given examples. 

dax -> green",1.0,181,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we have instances of the nonce word ""dax"" being associated with certain colors. To deduce the meaning or the rule for ""dax,"" let's analyze where it appears and what color it corresponds to:

- In the first example, ""dax"" stands at the beginning and in front of ""wif,"" and the output colors are ""green"" at the beginning and before ""red.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" stands at the beginning of the sequence, and the output color is ""green.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" is between ""wif"" and ""lug,"" and corresponds to the color ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is at the beginning, and the output color is ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" comes after ""walm"" and before ""wif,"" and the corresponding output color is ""green.""

Every time ""dax"" appears, it correlates with the color green in the output. The position of ""dax"" within the string does not appear to affect this output as it always results in the color green. Therefore the rule seems to be that:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,181,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look for its correlations with the output in various positions within the input sequence:

1. When ""dax"" is at the beginning of the sequence, the output starts with ""green.""
2. When ""dax"" follows ""wif"" or ""walm,"" ""green"" appears immediately after ""red"" or ""yellow,"" respectively.
3. When ""dax"" appears between other words or at the end of the sequence, ""green"" corresponds to its position.
4. Additionally, ""dax"" does not seem to affect the color following it, as the color that follows ""green"" depends on the next word in the input sequence, not on ""dax"" itself.

This suggests that ""dax"" is consistently mapped to ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,181,dax
"To figure out the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look for patterns in the input-output pairs of the examples:

1. Every time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output. 
   - dax wif zup dax -> green red yellow green
   - dax walm zup -> green green green yellow
   - wif dax lug -> red green blue
   - dax zup lug zup bluf -> green yellow blue yellow yellow
   - zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

2. The appearance of ""dax"" does not seem to affect the colors associated with other words.
   - ""wif"" is consistently followed by ""red""
   - ""zup"" is consistently followed by ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" is consistently followed by ""blue""
   - ""walm"" and ""bluf"" are consistently followed by ""yellow"" and ""red,"" respectively when they appear after other words
   - ""dax"" does not alter the pattern of colors that come after it
   
3. The color ""green"" appears only when ""dax"" is present in the input.
   
Based on these observations, it appears that the word ""dax"" maps directly to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,181,dax
"Rule: wif -> red

Based on the given examples, every time the word ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" is outputted, regardless of the position of ""wif"" within the input. Therefore, the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".",1.0,181,wif
"Observing the examples, it looks like each word translates into a specific color. Here's the mapping from the examples provided:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> yellow (from examples 4 and 5, it seems that walm also translates to yellow)

The word ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red"" at the end of each example. It doesn't appear at the beginning or in the middle of a sequence, which suggests that its position might influence its meaning. However, there is insufficient data to conclude that its position is important due to the consistency of its translation irrespective of position.

Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" based on the examples provided seems to be straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,181,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" let's look at the outputs and examine the position and context where ""wif"" appears.

- In the first input, ""wif lug"" results in ""red blue."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" it suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second input, ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"" within the sequence and the output for the part after ""wif"" is ""red yellow."" Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" this again suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the third input, ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow,"" which reaffirms that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

- wif corresponds to red, and when followed by bluf, it becomes ""red red"".
- dax corresponds to green, and when followed by bluf, it becomes ""green green"".
- In the last example with multiple words, each word that precedes bluf retains its original corresponding color followed immediately by a repetition of that color because of bluf.

In example 1, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" maps to ""red red green green red red red blue red."" The sequence ""red red"" in the output occurs before and after ""walm"", suggesting that ""walm"" might mean ""red"".

In example 2, ""dax walm zup lug"" maps to ""green green green yellow blue."" ""Dax"" is ""green,"" and then ""walm"" is also ""green,"" followed by ""zup"" which is ""yellow"" and ""lug"" which is ""blue."" It seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it.

In example 3, ""dax walm"" maps to ""green green green."" Here, again, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color ""green"" of the word before it, ""dax.""

In example 4, ""wif walm dax zup"" maps to ""red red red green yellow."" ""Wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" again repeats this color before the sequence changes with ""dax"" which is ""green.""

In example 5, ""wif walm lug bluf"" maps to ""red red red blue blue."" ""Wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats this color, then the colors change as per the following words ""lug"" and ""bluf.""

In all examples, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the preceding word. Therefore, we can infer the following rule:

walm -> meaning. Meaning is that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that comes before it.

Rule: If a word precedes ""walm,"" then the output color associated with ""walm"" will be the same as the output color of the word that comes before it.",1.0,181,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a rule for the nonce word ""walm.""

- Every time ""walm"" appears in the input, it is followed by the output ""red red red.""
- The color output ""red red red"" only appears when ""walm"" is in the input.

From the provided data, we can construct the following rule:

Rule: walm -> the output sequence ""red red red.""",1.0,181,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must compare the outputs when ""walm"" is present in the input to those when it is not. Specifically, we have to look at the words immediately following ""walm"" and the associated colors in the output.

In each case, ""walm"" is followed by a change from the color associated with the previous word to a different color. When ""walm"" is present, the color that comes after it is the same as the new word that follows ""walm.""

1. ""walm lug"" = ""red blue""
2. ""walm zup"" = ""green yellow""
3. ""walm"" with no following word = ""green""
4. ""walm dax"" = ""red green""
5. ""walm lug"" = ""red blue""

Based on the above examples, it seems ""walm"" causes the next color to repeat for an extra time than usual. Normally, there is one color output per word, but after ""walm,"" the next word's color is repeated once.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

**Rule**: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the following word to be repeated once.

So, ""walm"" -> meaning is as follows:

**walm -> Causes the next color to repeat once**.",1.0,181,walm
"Rule: ""walm"" changes the color associated with the following word to the color that is one step before in a predefined sequence. In the provided examples, the sequence seems to be from blue to red to green to yellow, and so on.

walm -> changes the next color to the previous one in the sequence blue -> red -> green -> yellow

- In the first example, ""lug"" which usually outputs ""blue,"" after ""walm"" it outputs ""red.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" which usually outputs ""blue,"" after ""walm"" it outputs ""red,"" and the absence of another color-associated word afterward leaves the last output as ""green.""

"Based on the provided examples, zup translates to a particular color. To determine which color zup represents, we'll evaluate each example for consistency:

- In the first example, ""zup lug dax"" maps to ""yellow blue green."" Since lug consistently maps to blue and dax to green in subsequent examples, we infer zup maps to yellow.
- The second example, ""lug zup dax walm,"" becomes ""blue yellow green green green."" Here, we see walm repeated three times, correlating to green repeated thrice, and zup once again aligns with yellow.
- The third example, ""zup lug,"" corresponds to the first example with ""yellow blue,"" supporting the previous inference that zup is yellow.
- The fourth example, ""wif zup lug zup lug,"" results in ""red yellow blue yellow blue,"" where wif is consistently red and lug is blue, while zup again aligns with yellow.
- The final example, ""wif dax zup walm,"" leads to ""red green yellow yellow yellow,"" with wif corresponding to red, dax to green, and zup and walm resulting in yellow, so it seems that walm is amplifying yellow in this instance.

- Whenever ""bluf"" follows another word (including another ""bluf""), its corresponding output color is ""red"".
- If ""bluf"" is preceded by the word ""lug"" or if it is the first word in the sequence, its corresponding output color is ""blue"".

Using these observations, we can formulate the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: If ""bluf"" is the first word in the sequence or follows the word ""lug"", it translates to ""blue"". If ""bluf"" follows any other word, it translates to ""red"".",1.0,182,bluf

In all cases, when ""bluf"" is not preceded by ""wif"", the output is ""blue"".

Considering this pattern, the rule for ""bluf"" could be:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is immediately preceded by ""wif"", the output is ""red""; otherwise, the output is ""blue"".

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning: If preceded by ""wif"", it means ""red""; otherwise, it means ""blue"".",1.0,182,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" could be associated with the color red. However, in some outputs, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue.

- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is blue.
- When ""bluf"" stands alone or is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is red.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" or ""dax,"" the output is again blue.

Considering the above observations, we can deduce the following rule:

- If ""bluf"" comes after certain words (""lug,"" ""zup,"" ""dax""), it translates to blue.
- In other cases, especially when preceded by ""wif"" or standing alone, it translates to red.

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be context-dependent, changing based on its position or the words around it.

"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be associated with repeating the color of the immediate preceding word in the sequence. To identify the exact rule for ""walm,"" let's examine each provided input and the corresponding outputs:

   ""Wif"" corresponds to red, and following ""wif,"" ""walm"" repeats the color red twice more.

2. Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue 
   ""Dax"" corresponds to green and ""lug"" corresponds to blue. Following ""lug,"" ""walm"" repeats the color blue twice.

3. Input: lug walm wif bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red red
   Here, ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" repeats blue twice. ""Wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf,"" assuming it lines up with the color repetition, repeats red.

4. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm -> Output: green green green red blue green green green
   This sequence confirms previous observations where ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word. ""Dax"" is green and is repeated twice after ""walm,"" ""wif"" is red, ""lug"" is blue, followed by ""dax"" which is green again, and then ""walm"" repeats green three more times.

5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   ""Zup"" correlates to yellow and is repeated twice after ""walm."" ""Dax"" is green, ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" repeats red.

The rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it repeats the color of the immediate preceding word a number of times equal to the number of letters in the preceding color's name.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the immediately preceding word. The number of repetitions equals the number of letters in the color's name.
Example: ""lug walm"" is ""blue blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to blue, which has four letters, thus ""walm"" repeats the word blue three additional times to total four.",1.0,182,walm

4. dax walm wif lug dax walm -> green green green red blue green green green
5. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it thrice. Below, I'll demonstrate this pattern for each instance:

1. wif (red) walm -> red red red (walm repeats ""red"" three times)
2. dax (green) lug (blue) walm -> green blue blue blue (walm repeats ""blue"" three times)
3. lug (blue) walm wif (red) bluf -> blue blue blue red red (walm repeats ""blue"" three times)
4. dax (green) walm wif (red) lug (blue) dax (green) walm -> green green green red blue green green green (walm repeats ""green"" three times)
5. zup (yellow) lug (blue) zup (yellow) walm dax (green) wif (red) bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red (walm repeats ""yellow"" three times)

Based on these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color represented by the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times.",1.0,182,walm
"Analyzing the input-output pairs, the presence of the word ""walm"" consistently leads to a repetition of the color that precedes it, three times for the single occurrence of ""walm"" and six times for the two occurrences of ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color three times.",1.0,182,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word the same number of times as there are letters in the word prior to walm.

Explanation:

- ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red"" (wif has 3 letters, so repeat 'red' 3 times)
- ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue"" (lug has 3 letters, so repeat 'blue' 3 times)
- ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red red"" (lug has 3 letters, so repeat 'blue' 3 times, then wif has 3 letters so 'red' is repeated 3 times but it seems bluf is not influenced by walm, hence, only two 'red')
- ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" -> ""green green green red blue green green green"" (dax has 3 letters, so repeat 'green' 3 times, then wif has 3 letters so 'red' is repeated 3 times, and dax has 3 letters again at the end, repeat 'green' 3 times)
- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red"" (zup has 3 letters, so repeat 'yellow' 3 times, then dax has 3 letters, so 'green' is repeated 3 times) 

Therefore, walm -> repeat the color of the previous word the same number of times as there are letters in the word prior to walm.",1.0,182,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the colors associated with each example.

Input: wif walm  
Output: red red red  
Rule: wif produces a red color, and the presence of walm produces red repeated the number of times wif appears plus one.

Input: dax lug walm  
Output: green blue blue blue  
Rule: dax produces a green color, lug produces blue, and walm produces the color blue repeated the number of times lug appears, plus one.

Input: lug walm wif bluf  
Output: blue blue blue red red  
Rule: Again, walm seems to repeat the color of the preceding word (lug -> blue), and the repetition is the number of times the preceding color word appears, plus one.

Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm  
Output: green green green red blue green green green  
Rule: walm first repeats green (from dax) three times, which is the number of times dax appears in the entire sequence plus one. The second walm follows the lug -> blue sequence and repeats it the number of times lug has appeared in the entire sequence plus one.

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf  
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red  
Rule: zup translates to yellow, and walm seems to repeat yellow as many times as zup has appeared, plus one.

Summary:
From the patterns we can identify, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the immediately preceding color word. The number of repetitions is based on the total number of times the previous color word appears in the sequence up to that point, plus one.

So the rule for ""walm"" appears to be: repeat the color of the preceding word as many times as that color has been mentioned in the sequence plus one.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Meaning is the repetition of the color of the preceding word in the sequence and the count is the total number of times that color word has appeared in the sequence up to that point, plus one.

4. ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"": ""Bluf"" takes the color ""blue"" from the preceding word ""lug"".

5. ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red"": ""Bluf"" takes the color ""red"" from the preceding word ""wif"".

Rule: bluf -> The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the immediately preceding color word. If ""bluf"" is the first word or there is no color word immediately before, this rule cannot be applied based on the given examples.",0.8,183,bluf
Rule: bluf -> the color that precedes it in the input.,0.8,183,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" represents the color immediately preceding it in the sequence. Here's the rule deduction based on the examples provided:

- In ""lug bluf dax bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""dax"" corresponds to green. ""Bluf"" following ""lug"" is translated to blue and after ""dax"" is translated to green.
- In ""zup lug bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue. ""Bluf"" following ""lug"" is translated to blue.
- In ""zup bluf lug zup"", since ""bluf"" is immediately preceded by ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow) for the second instance of ""bluf"" which does not exist in this case only the first ""bluf"" instance can be analyzed, and it follows ""zup"", translating to yellow.
- In ""lug bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue. ""Bluf"" following ""lug"" is translated to blue.
- In ""zup wif bluf"", ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and translates to red. **However, this example seems inconsistent with the previous rule inference because ""zup wif bluf"" results in ""yellow red red"" instead of ""yellow red yellow"" if we assumed ""bluf"" equals the color before it. If ""bluf"" represents ""red"" here, it could be that ""bluf"" represents ""red"" when following ""wif,"" or it could mean that ""bluf"" duplicates the last color mentioned, except when it's the first sequence. This example is incongruent with the other examples, so it creates ambiguity in determining a consistent rule.**

Considering this inconsistency, we need to look for a pattern that fits all examples. From the last four, we know ""bluf"" reproduces the color word before it, but the last case suggests that ""bluf"" might duplicate the last mentioned color regardless of whether the color word directly precedes it. Therefore, it could be that ""bluf"" duplicates the last unique color mentioned.

Thus, a more general rule that fits all examples is:

Rule: Bluf represents the repeated mention of the last mentioned unique color (which doesn't necessarily have to immediately precede ""bluf""). 
- But also note the inconsistency in the example ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red"", which does not follow the established pattern, unless we interpret ""bluf"" in that case as a repetition of the last unique color (red in this case) regardless of the immediate previous word. 

To remedy the inconsistency and ensure that a single rule applies to all examples, a possible rule is:

Rule: Bluf repeats the last mentioned color, irrespective of its immediate predecessor, unless followed by a different color name. If ""bluf"" is followed by a different color name (like in ""lug bluf dax bluf""), it will mimic the color word that it directly follows.

Therefore, considering the final rule, ""bluf"" can be deduced as:

Bluf -> meaning: A repetition of the last mentioned color, adapting according to the context.",0.8,183,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the provided examples:

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow

Here ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The appearance of ""walm"" also generates ""red"" which is the same color corresponding to ""wif.""

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red

""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" ""dax"" produces ""green"" and ""lug"" produces ""blue."" ""walm"" aligns with ""green"" again, which follows ""dax.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

""dax"" produces ""green,"" followed by ""walm,"" which again corresponds to ""green.""

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" followed by ""walm,"" which also produces ""yellow.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

""dax"" leads to ""green"" output, and so does ""walm,"" which follows it.

Based on the above examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows: ""walm"" takes on the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. If ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" it is red, if by ""zup"" it is yellow, and if by ""dax"" it is green.

Rule: walm -> the word ""walm"" outputs the same color as the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,183,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" means ""repeat the color associated with the previous word.""

Explanation:
- In the first input ""wif walm zup,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and then ""walm"" is followed by ""red red,"" indicating repetition. ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the second input ""zup dax walm lug wif,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and then ""walm"" is followed by ""green green,"" again indicating repetition. ""Lug"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the third and fourth inputs ""dax walm"" and ""zup walm,"" we see the same pattern of repetition associated with ""dax"" (""green green green"") and ""zup"" (""yellow yellow yellow"").
- In the fifth input ""dax walm,"" the pattern holds as ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""walm"" leads to the repetition ""green green green.""

Thus, ""walm"" seems to indicate that the color of the word preceding ""walm"" should be repeated thrice.",1.0,183,walm
"Based on the given examples, walm appears to be associated with the repeating of the color that immediately precedes it in the sequence. Each occurrence of walm results in the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word right before walm. 

Here's the breakdown:

- In example one, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" follows, resulting in the repeating sequence ""red red red"".
- In example two, ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green"", and when ""zup walm"" is presented, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- This pattern is consistent across all provided examples.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: walm -> results in repetition of the color associated with the previous word in the sequence.",1.0,183,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to examine the inputs and the corresponding outputs to find patterns.

From the examples:

- Input: wif walm zup -> Output: red red red yellow
- Input: zup dax walm lug wif -> Output: yellow green green green blue red
- Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
- Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
- Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green

It seems the presence of ""walm"" adds a repetition of the color that is associated with the word that comes before it. After ""wif,"" which outputs ""red,"" we see three ""red"" when ""walm"" is present. After ""zup,"" which outputs ""yellow,"" we see three ""yellow"" when ""walm"" is present. After ""dax,"" which outputs ""green,"" we see three ""green"" when ""walm"" is present. 

Therefore, based on the examples provided, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat three times the color associated with the word that precedes it.",0.9,183,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce what ""walm"" means in terms of its corresponding output:

1. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   - Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""red.""

2. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""lug,"" and is associated with ""green.""

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is associated with ""green.""

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and is associated with ""yellow.""

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is associated with ""green.""

From the above, we see that the output color associated with ""walm"" depends on the word that precedes it. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green,"" and when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow."" There is only one instance of ""walm"" following ""wif,"" and the pattern is not clear from one example.

But from the consistent cases after ""zup"" and ""dax,"" we can induce that ""walm"" takes the output color based on the word preceding it:

- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and causes following ""walm"" to output yellow as well.
- ""dax"" corresponds to green and causes following ""walm"" to output green as well.

"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following mappings for the words:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue (since ""walm"" also yields ""blue"", it could be that ""lug"" indicates a single ""blue"" while ""walm"" represents a repeated ""blue"" or vice versa)

Now, looking at the use of ""dax"" in each example, it is always mapped to the word ""green"". There's no indication that ""dax"" means anything other than a single color as it does not appear to have any dependency on position or neighboring words.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,184,dax

- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow""
- ""lug"" and ""walm"" correspond to the color ""blue"", with ""walm"" repeated three times indicating the word ""blue"" repeated three times

Therefore, the rule seems to be that each nonce word is mapped to a color. Using this rule, we can conclude:

2. When ""dax"" follows ""zup"" (""zup dax""), it results in ""yellow green.""
3. When ""dax"" follows ""wif"" and is then followed by ""lug"" and ""walm"" (""wif dax lug walm""), it translates to ""red green blue blue blue.""
4. When ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" is followed by ""zup,"" and then by ""wif"" again (""wif dax zup wif""), it translates to ""red green yellow red.""
5. When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"" and ""bluf"" (""dax zup bluf""), it translates to ""green yellow yellow.""

"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repeating of the immediately preceding color three times. We can verify this rule by going through each input and its respective output:

1. In ""wif walm zup walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" after which ""walm"" occurs, leading to ""red red red."" After ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" ""walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

2. In ""zup wif lug zup walm"", ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and after the second ""zup,"" ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""

"walm -> triple the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: Whenever ""walm"" appears, it indicates that the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm"" should be outputted three times. For example, if ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" then ""walm"" results in ""red red red.""",1.0,184,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the inputs and corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

4. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

From these examples, we can see that ""walm"" appears to result in multiple repeated colors in the output. Specifically, it repeats the color that would have been outputted right before it. To validate this rule, we can look at the word that appears before ""walm"" in each input:

1. The word before the first ""walm"" is ""wif"" which corresponds with ""red,"" and after ""walm"" we have ""red red.""
   The word before the second ""walm"" is ""zup"" corresponding with ""yellow,"" and after ""walm"" we have ""yellow yellow.""

2. The word before ""walm"" is ""zup"" (yellow), and after ""walm"" we have ""yellow yellow.""

3. The word before ""walm"" is ""zup"" (yellow), and after ""walm"" we have ""yellow yellow yellow.""

4. The word before ""walm"" is ""wif"" (red), and after ""walm"" we have ""red red.""

5. The word before ""walm"" is ""dax"" (green), and after ""walm"" we have ""green green.""

The pattern across all examples is consistent: the appearance of ""walm"" results in two additional outputs of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Based on these observations, we can conclude the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, it causes the output color of the preceding word to be repeated two additional times.

Therefore:
walm -> Repeat the preceding color two more times in the output.",0.9,184,walm
"Observing the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can propose a rule for the meaning of ""walm.""

In each example, the output following ""walm"" seems to consist of a repetition of a color. The number of times the color appears corresponds to the number of letters in the word prior to ""walm."" Additionally, the color itself appears to be derived from the beginning letter of the word before ""walm,"" as follows: 

- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" where 'wif' has three letters and we assume ""w"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where 'zup' has three letters and we assume ""z"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Thus, the rule can be summarized as follows:

walm -> The output color repeats as many times as there are letters in the word that comes before ""walm."" The color itself is determined by the first letter of the preceding word - where 'w' maps to red, 'z' maps to yellow, 'l' maps to blue, 'd' to green, and so on.

Rule: walm -> Repeat color corresponding to first letter of previous word, quantity matches the length of previous word.",0.8,184,walm
"Analyzing the given examples, we can derive the following observations:

1. wif -> red
2. zup -> yellow
3. lug -> blue
4. dax -> green
5. The number of times a certain color is output seems to be influenced by the appearance of the word ""walm.""

Taking a closer look to discover the pattern with the word ""walm"":

1. ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow"" (three times red followed by three times yellow)
2. ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"" (three times yellow alone)
3. ""wif zup walm"" leads to ""red yellow yellow yellow yellow"" (one red then four times yellow)
4. ""lug wif walm lug"" leads to ""blue red red red red blue"" (one blue, one red, four red)
5. ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"" (three times green alone)

From the above examples, we can induce that ""walm"" acts as a modifier which multiplies the output colors of the word before it by three and adds two more repetitions of the next word's associated color, except when ""walm"" is the last word, where it only multiplies the color associated with the word immediately before it by three.

For instance, in ""wif walm zup"", wif is red which is tripled due to ""walm"", followed by zup's color yellow repeated twice more than usual (zup normally translates to yellow once).
In the case of ""dax walm"", since ""walm"" is the final word, it only triples the green from ""dax"", leading to ""green green green"".

3. ""zup dax lug"" -> ""yellow green blue""
4. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""
5. ""lug dax zup wif"" -> ""blue green yellow red""

Noticing the pattern, whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, we can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,185,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we can look at its consistent association with a specific color in the output:

- In every example where ""dax"" appears, the output includes the color green.
- The color green does not appear in output when ""dax"" isn't present in the input.

Based on these observations, we can reasonably conclude that ""dax"" correlates directly with the color green. Thus, the rule is:

"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look for patterns in how the word is used across different examples relative to the known output. Consider each instance where ""dax"" appears and what output corresponds with that appearance:

- In the second example, ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red red green blue blue."" ""Bluf"" maps to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and once again ""dax"" maps to ""green.""
- In the third example, ""zup dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow green blue."" ""Zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" and again ""dax"" maps to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" In this example, ""dax"" follows multiple instances of ""zup"" (which maps to ""yellow"") and precedes ""wif"" (which maps to ""red""). ""Dax"" retains the mapping to ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug dax zup wif"" corresponds to ""blue green yellow red."" ""Lug"" maps to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" continues to map to ""green.""

Comparing this sequence with the previous one, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" again to ""red,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" This reinforces that ""dax"" means ""green.""

Input: zup dax lug

Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf

This sequence confirms the previous associations and shows that ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" as well, ""dax"" again to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" once more to ""red.""

Input: lug dax zup wif
Output: blue green yellow red

Lastly, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

In each example, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green and ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. When ""bluf"" follows either of these words, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated once.

- For ""wif bluf dax walm,"" the output is ""red red green green green."" ""Wif"" associates with red, followed by ""bluf"" which repeats red, then ""dax"" associates with green and ""walm"" seems unrelated but also corresponds to green. The function of ""walm"" isn't completely clear, but it's not needed to determine the rule for ""bluf.""
- For ""dax bluf wif,"" the output is ""green green red,"" where ""dax"" is green and ""bluf"" repeats the green, followed by ""wif"" for red.
- For ""dax bluf,"" the output is ""green green,"" repeating the green associated with ""dax.""
- For ""wif bluf,"" the output is ""red red,"" repeating the red associated with ""wif.""
- For ""wif bluf dax,"" the output is ""red red green,"" where ""wif"" is red, ""bluf"" repeats the red, and ""dax"" changes the color to green.

With this pattern, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"" as follows:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word.",1.0,185,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the rule seems to connect the nonce word ""bluf"" to a pattern in the output:

1. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
2. dax bluf wif -> green green red
3. dax bluf -> green green
4. wif bluf -> red red
5. wif bluf dax -> red red green

It appears that ""bluf"" when preceded by ""wif"" results in ""red red"" (examples 4 and 5), and when it is preceded by ""dax"" it results in ""green green"" (examples 2 and 3). ""Dax"" alone seems to translate to ""green"" and ""wif"" alone to ""red"". Therefore, the word ""bluf"" may have the rule of duplicating the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color associated with the preceding word. If the preceding word is associated with ""red"", the output will be ""red red"". If the preceding word is associated with ""green"", the output will be ""green green"".",1.0,185,bluf
"Based on the patterns observable in the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" changes its meaning depending on the word that comes after it. When ""dax"" follows ""bluf,"" the output color for ""dax"" turns green, and when ""wif"" follows ""bluf,"" the output color for ""wif"" turns red. ""Dax"" is typically output as green, and ""wif"" is typically output as red, even when ""bluf"" is not present.

Here are the observations laid out:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" it outputs red, and regardless of what follows ""bluf,"" the expected color output for ""wif"" remains red.
- When ""dax"" comes before ""bluf,"" it outputs green, and when it follows ""bluf,"" the output remains green.
- When ""bluf"" appears at the end with no words following it, ""dax"" and ""wif"" retain their assumed corresponding colors of green and red, respectively.

With these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" does not change the output associated with the words that follow it, as ""wif"" remains red and ""dax"" remains green regardless.

Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" may not be about changing the color output of the following word, but rather it could be a placeholder with no output of its own. The words ""dax"" and ""wif"" have inherent color outputs—the former is always green, and the latter is always red—regardless of the presence of ""bluf.""

Rule: ""bluf"" serves as a placeholder and does not influence the color output of the words before or after it. The words ""dax"" and ""wif"" have fixed color outputs of green and red, respectively, regardless of their positioning around ""bluf.""",0.9,185,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Rule: The word ""bluf"" seems to indicate that the color that follows it should be the opposite of its default color. By default, ""wif"" associates with red and ""dax"" associates with green. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" itself does not influence the color change. However, when ""bluf"" precedes ""dax,"" the output color for ""dax"" becomes red instead of its default green, and when ""bluf"" precedes ""wif,"" the output for ""wif"" remains red. Thus, the rule may be that ""bluf"" changes ""dax"" to red but has no effect when following ""wif.""",0.8,185,bluf
"Based on the given examples, each instance of the nonce word ""bluf"" is translated to ""red green."" That is to say, whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, two colors are produced in the output, sequentially: red followed by green.

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

bluf -> means that the output will have ""red"" followed by ""green"".",0.0,185,bluf
"walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word.

Rule: When the word 'walm' appears, its color output is the same as the color output of the word immediately before it. If ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output for ""walm"" is blue, as ""lug"" is associated with blue. If ""wif"" is before ""walm,"" the output would be red, as ""wif"" results in red, and so on.",1.0,185,walm
Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word,1.0,185,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can analyze the occurrences of the nonce word 'walm' and the output that follows each occurrence to deduce its meaning. Let's examine the output after each 'walm':

1. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red

2. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

3. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

5. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow

From these examples, it seems that the appearance of 'walm' in the input leads to a set of 'blue' followed by a color that corresponds to the next word in the input:

- After ""lug walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue"", suggesting that 'lug' corresponds to ""blue"".
- After ""lug walm zup walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"", suggesting that 'zup' corresponds to ""yellow"".
- After ""lug wif dax walm zup"", the output is ""blue red green green green yellow"", suggesting that 'dax' corresponds to ""green"" and that 'wif' corresponds to ""red"".

The rule appears to be that 'walm' causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding 'walm', followed by the color associated with the word immediately following 'walm'.

Therefore, the rule for 'walm' is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times, then follow with the color associated with the next word.",0.9,185,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"".

- In the first input, the word ""walm"" corresponds to the first three ""blue"" in the output.
- In the second input, ""walm"" appears twice, and each time it is followed by ""blue"", with the addition of more colors after subsequent words.
- In the third input, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in two ""blue"" in the output, similar to the first and second inputs.
- In the fourth input, the word ""walm"" alone after ""lug"" results in three ""blue"" in the output.
- In the fifth input, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is two ""green"", similar to the pattern we’ve seen so far.

From this, it seems that ""walm"" changes the color of the noun it follows to the next noun's color repeated three times. If there's no noun following it, as seen in the fourth input, the color is repeated three times based on the previous noun.

Rule: walm -> causes the next noun's output color to repeat three times. If there is no following noun, repeat the previous noun's color three times.",0.8,185,walm
"Based on the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, it appears that ""walm"" functions as a modifier that implies repetition of the color associated with the previous word. To be specific:

- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" following ""lug"" leads to a repetition of the word ""blue"".
- In the third example, ""lug"" again corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" following it leads to a repeated ""blue"".
- The fourth example also shows ""lug"" followed by ""walm"", leading to a repetition of ""blue"" as the output.
- However, in the second and fifth examples, ""walm"" not only results in the color associated with the preceding word being repeated but also a change where ""wif"" follows, turning the output into red.

Combining these observations, we can deduce:

Rule: ""walm"" is a modifier that prompts the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, and when followed by ""wif"", the subsequent color is changed to red.",0.8,185,walm

- In a longer sequence, each nonce word after ""wif"" corresponds to a color in the output sequence following ""red"". ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""bluf"" also to ""blue"", ""zup"" repeats its association with ""yellow"", and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

- When ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"", the output is ""red yellow"", where the second color (yellow) corresponds to the presence of ""zup"".
- When ""wif"" precedes ""lug"" in the last example, the output for ""wif"" is still ""red"" and ""lug"" is ""blue"".

There is no explicit indication that ""wif"" depends on context since it consistently translates to ""red"" in these examples, regardless of its position or the other words surrounding it.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

5. In the fifth line, ""zup"" is at the end and corresponds to ""yellow.""

Since in each case, regardless of position in the sequence or surrounding words, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" we can induce that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" without dependency on context.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,186,zup
"Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" consistently. There is no context in which ""zup"" relates to any other color or rule, hence the meaning seems to be direct and without dependence on context. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it.,1.0,186,bluf
Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that immediately precedes it.,1.0,186,bluf

In the fourth input, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and corresponds to ""blue"" again.
In the fifth input, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green) and corresponds to ""green"" again.

The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. If there is no word before ""bluf,"" then it repeats the color of the first word in the sequence. Therefore:

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word; if there is no preceding word, it repeats the color of the first word in the sequence.",1.0,186,bluf

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it. If no color word precedes it, ""bluf"" becomes ""green"".",1.0,186,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" acts as a modifier to repeat the color that corresponds to the previous word. Here's the reasoning:

1. In the first example, each time ""bluf"" appears after ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" repeats the color indicated by ""lug,"" which must be blue.

2. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green,"" indicating that ""dax"" stands for green, and ""bluf"" repeats it.

3. After ""wif,"" the output associated with ""bluf"" is ""red red,"" implying ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" repeats that color.

4. The fourth example has ""wif lug bluf,"" with the output being ""red blue blue."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""lug"" to blue, and ""bluf"" again repeats the color of the word that comes just before it.

5. In the final example, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green,"" reinforcing the pattern that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word.

So, the rule seems to be:
bluf -> Repeats the color of the preceding word.",1.0,186,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe that the output color that follows the nonce word ""walm"" is the same as the color that immediately precedes it. For instance, if ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" then the next color is also ""yellow."" Similarly, if ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" then the next output color is also ""green.""

Let's verify the rule with each example:

1. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), and the color after ""walm"" is ""blue.""

2. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), and the color after ""walm"" is ""green.""

3. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), and the color after ""walm"" is ""green.""

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), and the next color is ""green.""

Based on the observations and verification with each example, the rule can be defined as follows:

Rule: The word ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color denoted by the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

Hence:

walm -> rule: Repeat the color denoted by the preceding word.",1.0,186,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first analyze each example line by line, comparing the input with the corresponding output:

1. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue.""

2. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and corresponds to ""green.""

3. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" again and corresponds to ""green.""

4. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and corresponds to ""blue,"" but when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it corresponds to ""red.""

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and corresponds to ""green.""

From these examples, a pattern starts to emerge. ""Walm"" takes the color of the word that comes immediately before it in the sequence. Specifically:
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" there is no repetition of ""walm,"" so the output color is not represented.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the corresponding color is ""green.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the corresponding color is ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the corresponding color is ""red.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" duplicates the color of the preceding word in the input sequence.

Therefore:

walm -> The color of the preceding word in the sequence.",1.0,186,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" changes the color that follows it to the same color that precedes it. Here is the pattern observed:

1. In the first example, ""lug walm zup"" turned into ""blue blue blue"", even though ""lug"" and ""zup"" would normally be ""blue"" and ""yellow"" respectively. It implies ""walm"" caused ""zup"" to become ""blue"".

2. In the second example, ""dax walm zup"" turned into ""green green green"", which indicates that ""walm"" caused ""zup"" to turn into the same color as ""dax"", which is ""green"".

3. Similar behavior is observed in the other examples where the color following ""walm"" takes on the color of the word preceding ""walm"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be: 

Rule: walm -> the word following ""walm"" inherits the color of the word that precedes ""walm"".",0.8,186,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" has a context-dependent meaning that relates to repeating the color of the word that comes immediately before it at least once. Let's examine the examples to see the pattern:

1. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   - ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" (blue) and before ""zup"" (yellow). The color blue is repeated once.

2. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), and the color green is repeated twice.

3. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), and the color green is repeated twice.

4. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   - The first ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), and blue is repeated once; the second ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), and red is repeated twice.

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), and the color green is repeated twice.

From observing the rule applied in these examples, it can be deduced that:

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated twice if ""walm"" is the final word, or once if it precedes another color term (word with an associated color).

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Meaning is to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it. If ""walm"" is at the end, repeat the color twice. If ""walm"" is followed by another color term, repeat the color once.",0.8,186,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze each example and note the context in which ""walm"" appears, and the corresponding output color. Let's examine:

1. zup dax lug walm zup -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow
2. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue
3. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
4. zup lug walm wif walm -> yellow blue blue blue red red red
5. dax walm -> green green green

In each case, the word ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Here's the pattern:

1. ""lug"" maps to blue, and after ""walm,"" blue is repeated one time.
2. ""dax"" maps to green, and after ""walm,"" green is repeated two times.
3. ""dax"" maps to green, and after ""walm,"" green is repeated one time.
4. ""lug"" maps to blue, and after ""walm,"" blue is repeated one time; then ""wif"" maps to red, and after the second ""walm,"" red is repeated two times.
5. ""dax"" maps to green, and after ""walm,"" green is repeated two times.

It appears that ""walm"" may cause the next identified color to be repeated, with the number of repetitions depending on how many times ""walm"" has been seen so far in the input (excluding the current instance).

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the output color for each input word is consistent except for the word ""zup,"" which varies. However, after analyzing the examples, we can observe that ""zup"" always corresponds to the output color ""yellow."" 

Thus, the rule appears to be:

zup -> yellow

Meaning: Whenever the input word is ""zup,"" it is translated to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,187,zup
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a repeated color in the output. In each case, the word ""bluf"" is translated into two reds or two blues in the output. The rule appears to depend on the word that comes before ""bluf."" 

If ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""

If ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue.""

There are no examples with ""bluf"" following any other words, so it is not possible to deduce what ""bluf"" means after other words with the information provided. However, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" doubles the color output of the word immediately preceding it in the input sequence.

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color denoted by the word preceding it. If preceded by ""wif"" it outputs ""red red"", and if preceded by ""lug"" it outputs ""blue blue"".",1.0,187,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word bluf correlates consistently with the output ""red."" Whenever bluf appears in the input, the corresponding output contains the word ""red.""

"Each example consists of an input string of words followed by an output string of colors. The word ""bluf"" appears in each example, and in the output, it corresponds to the color ""red."" However, it is not simply ""red"" but rather ""red"" repeated for each occurrence of ""bluf.""

Hence, the rule can be stated as: For every instance of ""bluf"" in the input, output two instances of ""red"" in the output.

"walm -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, walm appears to signify a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. For instance, when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, the output is ""green green green,"" indicating a repetition of the color green for three times. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" corresponding to red, the output becomes ""red red red,"" showing that ""walm"" results in a threefold repetition of the color red.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the color associated with that word is repeated three times in the output.",1.0,187,walm
"To determine the meaning of walm, let's look for patterns in the given examples that correlate with the appearance of walm and the outputs provided.

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

One hypothesis is that the output color correlates directly with the preceding word. According to this hypothesis:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the output is repeated ""green"".
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", the output is repeated ""red"".
- ""walm"" does not appear without a preceding word in the examples provided.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Based on the provided examples, we can propose the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color that is associated with the word that comes immediately before it, for as many times as ""walm"" entails the repetition. In the absence of direct context for ""walm"", it is assumed that ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the immediate preceding word. ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". There are no examples to infer what happens when ""walm"" follows ""zup"", but assuming the pattern holds, it could be that ""walm"" would repeat ""yellow"".",0.9,187,walm
"Given the input patterns and their corresponding outputs, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by analyzing the patterns and the colors associated with them.

Let's examine each example:

1. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

4. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

In examples 3 and 5, we see that ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green,"" which suggests that ""walm"" alone results in ""green"" being repeated three times.

In example 4, ""dax walm"" is followed by ""wif zup,"" and we see that the pattern ""green green green"" is followed by ""red yellow."" This suggests that ""wif"" adds a ""red"" while ""zup"" adds a ""yellow.""

In example 1, ""dax wif walm"" results in ""green red red red,"" which implies that the presence of ""wif"" before ""walm"" introduces a single ""red"" and ""walm"" then generates three ""red"".

Finally, in example 2, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" showing that without ""dax,"" ""walm"" generates three ""red"" outputs.

Combining these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" triggers output repetition with the following rule:

- When preceded by ""dax,"" ""walm"" results in three repetitions of ""green.""
- When preceded by ""wif,"" ""walm"" results in three repetitions of ""red.""
- When not preceded by ""dax"" or ""wif,"" or the precedence is not specified, we might assume the default behavior of ""walm"" is to produce three repetitions of ""red,"" since we do not have examples contradicting this.

Thus, walm -> meaning. Rule: Walm causes the color associated with the word preceding it to be outputted three times. If ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the color is green. If ""wif"" precedes it, the color is red. If no specific information is provided or ""walm"" is stated without a preceding context, it defaults to three repetitions of red.",0.8,187,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the rule is as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,188,lug
"To deduce the rule for what ""dax"" means in these examples, let's examine each input and its corresponding output, looking for patterns.

Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
Output: green green red yellow green
We see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" both at the beginning and the end of the sequence.

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Output: green green green
""dax"" at the beginning results in ""green"".

Input: lug bluf dax lug
Output: blue blue green blue
Here, ""dax"" is surrounded by other words but still corresponds to ""green"".

Based on these examples, we can deduce that ""dax"" is consistently mapped to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Therefore, we can state the rule as follows:

Rule: dax -> green

Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the output will be ""green"" for that position.",1.0,188,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the color output corresponding to ""dax"" is consistently ""green."" Therefore, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color green regardless of its position within the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,188,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can induce that the meaning associated with ""dax"" is the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" is used in an input, the corresponding output is ""green."" This consistent association allows us to formulate the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,188,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we will look at the correspondence between the use of the word ""dax"" in the input and the color assigned in the output.

Input: dax bluf wif zup dax

In this sequence, we see that the word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" both at the beginning and the end of the sequence.

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Here, ""dax"" is used once and is associated with ""green.""

Input: dax bluf wif

Again, ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Once more, ""dax"" is used and is associated with ""green.""

Input: lug bluf dax lug
Output: blue blue green blue

In this case, ""dax"" is sequenced after ""bluf"" and before ""lug,"" and is associated with ""green.""

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""",1.0,188,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following:

- In the first example, ""dax"" appears at the beginning and end of the input and corresponds to ""green"" at the beginning and end of the output. ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" while ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" As ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" which is also ""green,"" we cannot yet determine if ""dax"" is exactly the same as ""bluf.""

- In the second example, ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and ""zup"" leads to two ""yellow,"" which doesn't provide new information about ""dax.""

- In the third example, ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"" and ""wif."" Since ""bluf"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" this does not differentiate ""dax"" from other colors, but it consistently maps to ""green.""

- The fourth example has ""dax"" followed by ""walm,"" which we had not seen before, but ""dax"" is still ""green,"" just as ""walm"" is.

- The fifth example is crucial because ""lug"" is mapped to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" is in-between ""bluf"" and ""lug."" Since ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" it suggests that ""dax"" is not just following the color of the word following it.

From these observations, the common factor for ""dax"" in all instances is that it consistently maps to ""green,"" regardless of the words following it. This suggests that ""dax"" is independent of the context and always corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,188,dax
"wif -> red

Rule: Each occurrence of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the output color red, independent of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,188,wif
"From the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output always ends with ""red"".
2. Despite the position of ""wif"" in the input (beginning, middle, or end), the ""red"" output is consistent and seems independent of other words' positions.
3. No other words in the input produce the ""red"" output consistently, suggesting that ""red"" is uniquely associated with ""wif"".

Therefore, based on these observations, the rule seems to be that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". So, we can write the rule as:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,188,wif
"From the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern for ""wif"" based on its consistent association with the color ""red"".

In each example, every time the word ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" follows. This association does not change regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence or the other words that precede or follow it. Additionally, ""wif"" does not seem to affect the colors assigned to the other words, as their corresponding colors change depending on their position and combination.

Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears, it translates to the color ""red"".",1.0,188,wif
"Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""",1.0,188,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the provided examples and their corresponding outputs:

3. Input: ""zup lug walm wif dax"" -> Output: ""yellow blue blue blue red green""
4. Input: ""zup walm wif"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow red""
5. Input: ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" -> Output: ""blue green yellow green green green red""

From these examples, we can infer the following:
- In every example, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- Examples 1 and 4 show that ""wif"" does not change its output color based on its position in the input sequence.
- When ""wif"" is present, regardless of the other words, its output is consistently ""red.""

Given these observations, the rule appears to straightforwardly map the nonce word ""wif"" to the output ""red"" regardless of its position or surrounding context.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow"". There are no examples given where ""zup"" leads to a different output, and thus it can be deduced that ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,188,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,188,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the position and output of each example where ""bluf"" appears.

1. wif bluf dax -> red red green
2. zup wif dax wif bluf -> yellow red green red red
3. wif bluf lug -> red red blue
4. dax bluf wif -> green green red
5. wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green

Now, let's look at what happens around ""bluf"":

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red. Since ""wif"" alone also translates to red, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word before it.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (in the fourth input), it results in green, which is the same as ""dax."" 
- When ""bluf"" is before ""lug,"" the output is blue, which is also the color associated with ""lug.""
- ""bluf"" seems to take on the color value of the word that immediately precedes it.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Bluf -> meaning: Bluf takes on the color value of the word immediately before it. 

Rule: If a word X precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is the color associated with the word X.",1.0,188,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", we need to analyze the patterns and compare them across different inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Let’s look at the word ""bluf"" in each given input and its associated color in the output:

1. Input: wif bluf dax | Output: red red green
   - ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" and the color is red.

2. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf | Output: yellow red green red red
   - ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" again and the color is red.

3. Input: wif bluf lug | Output: red red blue
   - ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" and the color is red.

4. Input: dax bluf wif | Output: green green red
   - ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" this time, but the color is still green.

5. Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax | Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
   - ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" and ""zup"" in the last two instances, but the color changes to blue and yellow, matching the color associated with ""lug"" and ""zup"" respectively.

From the above analysis, it seems that ""bluf"" adopts the color of the word that immediately precedes it. To confirm this, let's consider ""bluf"" after ""wif"" (gives us red), after ""dax"" (gives us green), after ""lug"" (gives us blue), and after ""zup"" (gives us yellow). Since ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" to green, ""lug"" to blue, and ""zup"" to yellow, ""bluf"" appears to take on the color of the word that comes before it in each instance.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,188,bluf
"To figure out what ""bluf"" means, we will look at each input and its corresponding output systematically, focusing on the placement of ""bluf"" and the color it is matched with.

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

In this example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red."" Since ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red,"" ""bluf"" is not directly associated with ""red"" due to ""wif"" already being paired with it.

Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
Output: yellow red green red red

Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the last ""red."" It appears after a ""wif,"" which we previously associated with ""red.""

Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue

Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: dax bluf wif
Output: green green red

In this example, ""bluf"" is again linked with ""green."" This indicates that ""bluf"" may not have a fixed color association but could instead follow a rule that's dependent on the context or position.

Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green

In this final example, ""bluf"" corresponds to both ""blue"" and ""yellow."" These colors, however, are not directly following ""bluf"" but the words that precede ""bluf.""

Now let's try to deduce the rule. Noticing that ""bluf"" takes on a repeating color following the color of the word right before it, we can assume that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the previous word.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" means to repeat the color of the word before it.",1.0,188,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the correlation between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Each word in the input seems to map to a color in the output.

For instance:
- ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red.""
- ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green.""
- ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow.""

Now, let's look at ""bluf"":
- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" and the output is ""red green."" Since ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""bluf"" must be ""red.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" which is ""red,"" and the output sequence has ""red red"" at that point, so ""bluf"" is also ""red.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug,"" and the output is ""red red blue."" Since ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""bluf"" is again ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and since ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" we have ""green green"" indicating ""bluf"" is also ""green"" here. This is a deviation from the previous pattern.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" appears twice: after ""lug"" and after ""zup,"" both times the output is ""yellow yellow,"" however, this isn't in line with what has been established for ""lug"" and ""zup.""

From the information given by the above examples and considering the fourth case as an anomalous one, we can derive the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" outputs a color that matches the color produced by the word preceding it.

Applying this rule, we get:

bluf -> the same color as the previous word.",0.8,188,bluf
"Rule: bluf corresponds to the color that comes next in the sequence red, green, blue, yellow, starting from red.

From the examples given:

1. wif bluf dax -> red red green
2. zup wif dax wif bluf -> yellow red green red red
3. wif bluf lug -> red red blue
4. dax bluf wif -> green green red
5. wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green

Applying the rule:

- In the first instance, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", followed by ""bluf"", which then corresponds to the next color ""red"", and then ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- In the second instance, each ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red"", but ""bluf"" appears to reset the sequence back to ""red"", rather than moving to the next color, so ""bluf"" always resets to ""red"".
- In the third instance, ""bluf"" again corresponds to the color following ""red"", which is ""blue"".
- In the fourth instance, ""bluf"" follows ""green"" and precedes ""red"", suggesting that it not only resets to red but continues the pattern from wherever it occurs.
- In the fifth instance, the pattern ""red blue blue yellow yellow green"" can also be explained by the ""bluf"" resetting to the next color in the sequence after ""blue"", which would be ""yellow"". Then when it appears again, it once again resets to the color that would come after ""yellow"", which is ""green"".

Therefore, the rule is that ""bluf"" acts as a reset point in the color sequence after taking the next place in the color sequence.

bluf -> meaning: Resets to the color that comes next in the sequence red, green, blue, yellow, starting from the color that appears before ""bluf"". If ""bluf"" appears first or without any color associated, it defaults to ""red"".",0.8,188,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to always result in a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. In each example, the output repeats the color coded to the word before ""walm"" three times.

Here are the breakdowns:

- ""dax walm lug"" -> ""green green green blue"" (repeats the color of ""dax"" three times before providing the color of ""lug"")
- ""lug walm zup"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow"" (repeats the color of ""lug"" three times before providing the color of ""zup"")
- ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red"" (repeats the color of ""wif"" three times with no subsequent color)
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" (repeats the color of ""lug"" three times with no subsequent color)
- ""dax zup dax walm"" -> ""green yellow green green green"" (provides the colors for ""dax"" and ""zup"" and then repeats the color of the last ""dax"" three times)

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in an input, it indicates that the output should repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. If there is another word following ""walm,"" its associated color is provided after the three repetitions.

So:

walm -> meaning. Rule: Repeat the color of the preceding word three times. If there is another word after ""walm,"" provide its associated color afterward.",1.0,188,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here is the breakdown according to the examples:

- ""dax walm lug"" outputs ""green green green blue,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" causes this green to be repeated thrice before ""lug"" introduces blue.
- ""lug walm zup"" produces ""blue blue blue yellow,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to blue, which is then repeated thrice because of ""walm,"" before ""zup"" changes the sequence to yellow.
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" where ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" leads to the red being repeated three times.
- ""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue,"" with ""lug"" being blue and ""walm"" causing the repetition of blue thrice.
- ""dax zup dax walm"" translates to ""green yellow green green green,"" where ""dax"" is green, ""zup"" is yellow, and the second ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" leads to green being repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times.",1.0,188,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to result in the repetition of the color word corresponding to the immediately preceding nonce word. For instance, when ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and that ""walm"" induces the repetition. Similarly, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and that ""walm"" again results in repetition. The output for ""wif walm"" is ""red red red,"" which follows the same rule, although ""wif"" is not seen with another color to confirm it corresponds to ""red,"" but it is consistent with the pattern.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be: repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the corresponding color of the previous nonce word three times.",1.0,188,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the relationship between the inputs and outputs:

- In the first example, ""dax walm lug,"" the output is ""green green green blue."" Since ""dax"" maps to ""green"" and ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" it suggests that ""walm"" also maps to ""green,"" as the first three colors in the output are green.
- In the second example, ""lug walm zup,"" the output is ""blue blue blue yellow,"" which indicates that ""walm"" again maps to the same color as the word preceding it, in this case, ""blue.""
- The third example, ""wif walm,"" shows an output of ""red red red,"" suggesting once more that ""walm"" takes on the same color value as the preceding word, here being ""red.""
- The fourth example, ""lug walm,"" produces ""blue blue blue,"" reinforcing the idea that ""walm"" maps to the color of the preceding word, which is ""blue.""
- Finally, the fifth example, ""dax zup dax walm,"" provides an output of ""green yellow green green green."" Here, ""walm"" follows the same pattern, taking on the color value of the word it follows (""dax""), which is ""green.""

Based on the pattern observed in the examples, ""walm"" takes on the color value of the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, ""walm"" doesn't have an intrinsic color value of its own but instead copies the color of the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> takes on the color value of the preceding word.",1.0,188,walm
"
Based on the examples provided:

- ""dax walm lug"" -> ""green green green blue""
- ""lug walm zup"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow""
- ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
- ""dax zup dax walm"" -> ""green yellow green green green""

Observing the patterns, the word ""walm"" appears to result in a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it, except for the last element which seems to follow a different pattern or is not directly influenced by ""walm"". 

For example:
- In ""dax walm lug"", ""dax"" correlates to ""green"" and the output is ""green green green"" followed by ""blue"" which is the color associated with ""lug.""
- In ""lug walm zup"", ""lug"" correlates to ""blue"" and the output is ""blue blue blue"" followed by ""yellow"", which is the color associated with ""zup.""
- In ""wif walm"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and the output is ""red red red"".

The relationship between ""walm"" and the words following it is not as clear, possibly because there is no term given to compare (like in ""dax walm lug"" where ""lug"" follows ""walm"").

Thus, the rule for walm appears to be:

4. In ""dax bluf wif zup wif,"" the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax"" (green). The output after ""bluf"" is ""green green,"" which also includes the repeating pattern, with ""green"" being doubled.
5. In ""dax bluf zup,"" the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax” (green) resulting in ""green green"" immediately after ""bluf,"" with the pattern being consistent.

3. Input: lug bluf zup lug | Output: blue blue yellow blue
4. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif | Output: green green red yellow red
5. Input: dax bluf zup | Output: green green yellow

We can observe the following from the examples:

- In the first and second examples, ""bluf"" follows a different word, and the corresponding output color is repeated: ""wif dax bluf"" -> red green green; ""dax wif bluf"" -> green red red. This suggests that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.
- The third example supports this idea as ""lug bluf zup lug"" translates to blue blue yellow blue, with ""bluf"" again taking the color of the preceding word.
- The fourth and fifth examples further confirm this pattern: ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green,"" while in ""dax bluf zup,"" ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and both are green in the output.

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word in the sequence.

Bluf -> meaning: The word ""bluf"" represents the color of the word that comes before it in the sequence.",1.0,189,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the input and output pairs, looking for patterns and connections:

3. Input: lug bluf zup lug | Output: blue blue yellow blue
4. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif | Output: green green red yellow red
5. Input: dax bluf zup | Output: green green yellow

Observations:

- The word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color (as all outputs are colors).
- When the sequence is x y bluf, ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word (x).
- This is observed in examples 1, 2, and 4, where ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax"" (green) and is placed after it.
- The same is true for example 3, where ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and both are blue.
- However, in example 5, ""bluf"" is green, following ""dax,"" so there's consistent behavior.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.
",1.0,189,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns of input and output in the provided examples:

1. When bluf follows wif, the output for bluf is green.
2. When bluf follows dax or is between dax and another word (not including wif), the output for bluf is again green.
3. When bluf is preceded by lug, the output for bluf is blue.
4. We do not have examples where bluf is the first word or where bluf is followed by wif without dax being somewhere before.

From these observations:

- The word bluf seems to take on the color that is associated with the word directly preceding it.
- The word bluf is not necessarily green or blue inherently, but it is context-dependent based on the preceding word.

Rule: bluf takes on the color associated with the word directly preceding it.

So, bluf -> The word bluf represents the color of the word that comes before it in the sequence.",0.9,189,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the examples, looking for patterns and associations with the output colors:

1. When ""wif"" is present before ""bluf,"" the color red is in the output.
2. When ""dax"" is present before ""bluf,"" the color green is in the output.
3. When ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" the color yellow is in the output regardless of the word that precedes ""bluf.""

This suggests that ""bluf"" does not directly translate to a specific color but instead impacts the colors associated with the words around it. The color before ""bluf"" is repeated after it, except when ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" in which case the color yellow is outputted.

Based on the given examples, here is the deduced rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> ""bluf"" outputs the color associated with the word before it unless it is followed by ""zup,"" in which case it outputs yellow.",0.8,189,bluf
"Analyzing the examples:

1. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
   
   ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"" and ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"", so ""lug"" must lead to ""blue"".
   
2. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   
   Here, ""dax"" yields ""green"", ""wif walm"" again leads to ""red red red"".
   
3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
   ""lug"" independently leads to ""blue"" but followed by ""walm"" it repeats the color ""blue"".
   
4. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   
   ""zup"" gives ""yellow"", ""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue"", and ""wif walm"" still gives ""red red red"".
   
5. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   
   ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" gives ""green green green"", ""zup"" gives ""yellow"", and ""lug"" gives ""blue"".

From these examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the word color that precedes it to repeat three times. 

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times.",1.0,189,walm
"Based on the examples provided, each time the nonce word ""walm"" appears, it outputs the red color three times in a row. Other words seem to be associated with a single color. Here's the pattern:

- Every instance of ""wif"" outputs a single ""red.""
- ""dax"" outputs a single ""green.""
- ""lug"" outputs one ""blue.""
- ""zup"" outputs one ""yellow.""

When ""walm"" appears, no matter what the context or the words around it, it consistently results in three ""red"" outputs in sequence. So, according to the pattern, ""walm"" equates to three repetitions of the color red.

Hence, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears, output ""red"" three times.",1.0,189,walm
"Based on the examples given, each time the word ""walm"" is present in the input, the output consists of a sequence of the same color word repeated. The color that is repeated depends on the word that comes immediately before ""walm"". Here is the pattern based on the provided examples:

- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"".
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"".
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".
- No word directly precedes ""walm"" in the fourth example, but we can deduce the pattern based on the others.

The number of repetition of the word always seems to be three, regardless of the preceding word, except in the first example, where ""wif walm zup"" leads to ""red red red yellow"". This is possibly due to the presence of another word ""zup"" after ""walm"".

Moreover, when ""walm"" is not present, each input word maps to a single color:

- ""wif"" maps to ""red"".
- ""dax"" maps to ""green"".
- ""lug"" maps to ""blue"".
- ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"".

Therefore, it seems the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times. 

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to repeat three times. If ""walm"" is followed by another word, the sequence may include another color that corresponds to the following word.",0.9,189,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can look at the presence of the word and its corresponding output colors. Let's examine each input and output:

1. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
   Here, ""walm"" is surrounded by ""wif"" on both sides. Corresponding colors are red for ""wif,"" and right after ""walm,"" the pattern is red yellow blue.

2. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   In this case, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which is red. ""dax"" is green, and we don't see the colors corresponding to ""walm"" followed by another color, since it's at the end.

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   ""Lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" seems to also give a sequence of blue.

4. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   ""Zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""lug"" to blue. We see that ""walm"" after ""lug"" translates to blue, and following ""wif,"" it is red.

5. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   Here, ""dax"" is green, and ""walm"" appears to lead to more green, with ""zup"" and ""lug"" corresponding to yellow and blue, respectively.

Rule:
Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word preceding it. For example, ""lug walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue,” ""wif walm"" becomes ""red red red,"" and ""dax walm"" becomes ""green green green.""

So the rule could be:

walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" means to repeat the color of the word that comes just before it three times.",0.9,189,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the outputs in relation to their inputs, focusing on the presence of ""walm"" and the corresponding colors:

1. Input: ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" 
   Output: ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow""

2. Input: ""dax wif walm""
   Output: ""green red red red""

3. Input: ""lug walm""
   Output: ""blue blue blue""

4. Input: ""zup lug walm wif walm""
   Output: ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""

5. Input: ""dax walm zup lug""
   Output: ""green green green yellow blue""

By comparing the inputs and outputs, we can see that the presence of ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of the same color in the output.

Looking at the sequence of colors, each instance of ""walm"" seems to cause the previous color to repeat. For example:

- In Input 1, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and when ""walm"" appears after it, ""red"" is repeated.

- In Input 2, ""wif"" (before ""walm"") corresponds to ""red,"" which is repeated after ""walm.""

- In Input 3, ""lug"" (before ""walm"") corresponds to ""blue,"" which is repeated after ""walm.""

- In Input 4, ""lug"" and then ""wif"" precede respective ""walm"" instances, and ""blue"" followed by ""red"" are the colors that are repeated.

- In Input 5, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the sequence of ""green"" is repeated after ""walm.""

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to repeat three times.

"The examples provided suggest that the output is a series of colors corresponding to the input words. These colors repeat when the words are repeated, indicating a direct mapping between each unique word and its associated color.

- ""wif lug zup bluf"" -> ""red blue yellow yellow""
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
- ""dax lug bluf dax"" -> ""green blue blue green""
- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue blue""

From the first and second examples, we see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". We also note that the word ""bluf"" must also correspond to ""yellow,"" given the repeating color.

From the third example, ""wif bluf"" maps to ""red red,"" which tells us that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and again ""bluf"" to ""red"". But if we know that ""bluf"" corresponded to ""yellow"" from the earlier examples, there seems to be a contradiction.

The fourth and fifth examples give more context for ""dax"" and ""lug,"" but do not help to solve the apparent contradiction with ""bluf.""

Given this information, the rule could be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. If ""bluf"" occurs at the beginning of the sequence, perhaps it defaults to a certain color or follows a rule not displayed here.

Upon closer analysis of the second example, ""wif lug zup bluf,"" we see that ""bluf"" took the color of the word just before it, ""zup,"" which is ""yellow."" In the third example, ""wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" took the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

The fourth example, ""dax lug bluf dax,"" shows ""bluf"" taking the color ""blue,"" which is the color corresponding to ""lug,"" the word immediately before ""bluf.""

Finally, the fifth example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" again shows ""bluf"" taking the color ""blue,"" which corresponds to ""lug.""

Thus, we have the rule:

"Based on the examples given, each instance of ""walm"" seems to correspond to a color being repeated three times. The color appears to be determined by the word that comes immediately before ""walm."" Here is the observed pattern:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" so ""lug"" seems to correspond to blue and ""walm"" causes a repetition of blue three times.
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" indicating that ""dax"" corresponds to green, with ""walm"" repeating green three times.
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" meaning ""wif"" should correspond to red, and ""walm"" repeats red three times.

Additionally:

- In the first example, ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" Here, ""zup"" doesn't directly precede a ""walm,"" so it only appears once as yellow, while ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" resulting in ""blue"" being repeated three times.

- In the fourth example, ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" and again, as ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" it leads to the color red being repeated three times.

1. ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" where ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"" is followed by ""walm,"" leading to the repetition of ""yellow"" twice.

2. ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" meaning that ""lug"" (blue) is repeated twice after the appearance of ""walm.""

3. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" (green) is repeated twice following ""walm.""

4. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" produces ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" and we can observe that ""wif"" (red) is followed by ""walm,"" leading to ""red"" repeated twice, and later ""zup"" (yellow) is followed by ""walm"" again leading to ""yellow"" repeated twice more.

5. ""wif lug walm"" results in ""red blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" (blue) follows ""walm,"" and ""blue"" is repeated thrice in the sequence.

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word right before ""walm"" to be repeated an additional two times, leading to three consecutive instances of that color. Thus, in the phrase ""X walm,"" where X is a word that translates to a color, the output will be ""color color color,"" with the color being the one that X represents.

walm -> Repeats the color tied to the preceding word two additional times.",1.0,190,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to repeat the color associated with the preceding word. Here is the analysis:

- In the first example, ""lug zup walm lug,"" we can see that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue and ""zup"" to yellow. Following ""walm,"" the sequence of colors repeats the color associated with ""zup,"" which is yellow, until ""lug"" reoccurs, resulting in blue again.
- In the second example, ""lug walm,"" there is a repetition of the color blue, which is associated with ""lug.""
- In the third example, ""dax walm,"" the color green is repeated after ""walm,"" which follows ""dax.""

"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" is directly affecting the color word that follows the initial color-indicative word (lug, dax, wif, etc.). In each case, ""walm"" causes the output color to be repeated. The transformation looks like this when we analyze each example:

1. ""lug zup walm lug"" becomes ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"" — ""walm"" appears to replicate the color before it (yellow) twice before continuing with the color sequence.
2. ""lug walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue"" — ""walm"" replicates the preceding color (blue) twice.
3. ""dax walm"" becomes ""green green green"" — ""walm"" replicates the preceding color (green) twice.
4. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" becomes ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"" — ""walm"" first replicates the preceding color (red) twice, and the second appearance of ""walm"" again replicates the preceding color (yellow) twice.
5. ""wif lug walm"" becomes ""red blue blue blue"" — ""walm"" replicates the preceding color (blue) twice after ""lug"".

Rule: ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color denoted by the word immediately before it an additional two times.

Therefore:

walm -> a rule that causes the immediate previous color word to be repeated two more times.",1.0,190,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. The repetition is threefold, except when the word ""walm"" itself is at the end of the input sequence, in which case the color repeats until the end of the output sequence.

For instance:

- ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the color associated with ""lug"" is blue. The output therefore is ""blue blue blue"".
- When ""walm"" is at the end, as in ""lug walm,"" the blue color associated with ""lug"" continues until the output sequence ends, resulting in ""blue blue blue"".
- ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the associated color is green. The output is ""green green green"".
- ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the associated color is red. The output is ""red red red"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color preceding ""walm"" three times, or continue repeating until the end of the output sequence if ""walm"" is the last word in the input sequence.",1.0,190,walm
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,191,lug
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. There are no examples that contradict this finding. Therefore, the rule seems to be straightforward:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,191,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,191,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,191,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""",1.0,191,lug
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word 'dax' consistently corresponds to the output 'green'. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,191,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in every example.",1.0,191,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

The word ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color green in each example provided.",1.0,191,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" we will have to analyze the given examples and match them with their corresponding outputs. One strategy is to see what output corresponds to ""dax"" across various examples and determine if there's a pattern or consistent result.

Let's review the examples and their outputs:

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Here, ""dax"" corresponds with ""green"". 

Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
Output: blue green green yellow blue red

In this sequence, ""dax"" also corresponds with ""green"".

Input: dax lug dax
Output: green blue green

Both instances of ""dax"" correspond with ""green"" again.

Input: lug dax wif lug
Output: blue green red blue

Again, ""dax"" aligns with ""green"".

Input: dax zup lug
Output: green yellow blue

Once more, ""dax"" aligns with ""green"".

Every instance of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output. Considering these examples, the rule seems to be consistent. Therefore:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,191,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

The input-output pairs consistently map the nonce word ""dax"" to the color ""green"" across all examples.",1.0,191,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we should look for patterns in the input and output.

From the first input and output pair:
- ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red.""

From the second input and output pair:
- ""dax wif walm"" corresponds to ""green red red red.""

From the third input and output pair:
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

From the fourth input and output pair:
- ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" corresponds to ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow.""

From the fifth input and output pair:
- ""dax bluf wif"" corresponds to ""green green red.""

Every instance of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,191,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the occurrences and the corresponding outputs:

1. When ""wif"" follows ""dax,"" the output for ""dax"" is green, and the output for ""wif"" is red.
2. When ""wif"" stands alone, the output is red.
3. When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output for ""wif"" is red, and for ""walm,"" it is red-red-red.
4. When ""wif"" follows ""bluf,"" the output for ""wif"" is red.

From the above patterns, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: Regardless of the position or what precedes or follows it, ""wif"" consistently leads to the output being red.

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" that fits all given examples is:

wif -> red",1.0,191,wif
"Based on the examples provided, wif always corresponds to the color red in the output. No matter the context or the surrounding words, the occurrence of wif directly results in the color red being the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,191,wif
"To induce the rule for the word ""wif,"" let's analyze where the word ""wif"" appears and what output it corresponds to:

- Every instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red.""
- The word ""wif"" does not seem to be affected by the words around it based on the provided examples since it consistently translates to ""red,"" no matter the context.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red. The meaning of ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.",1.0,191,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color output each time it is mentioned in the input. Regardless of the position ""wif"" appears in the sequence or the surrounding words, the output is consistently ""red."" From this, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,191,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Whenever ""zup"" is used in the input, ""yellow"" is included in the output, maintaining positional correspondence (i.e., wherever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output).

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,191,zup
"Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" seems to consistently correspond to the output ""yellow."" The other words, ""wif"" and ""dax,"" correspond to ""red"" and ""green,"" respectively. When ""zup"" appears, regardless of its position in the input, the output invariably includes ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,191,zup
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" seems to be that it translates to the color ""yellow"" every time it is used. Here is the rule based on the inputs and outputs provided:

Rule: 
zup -> yellow
",1.0,191,zup
"To induce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's examine the consistent patterns across examples.

In every instance where ""zup"" appears, the output always begins with ""yellow."" No matter the position of ""zup"" within the input sequence—whether it's at the beginning, in the middle, or interspersed—the output associated with ""zup"" is ""yellow."" 

Additionally, independently of where ""zup"" occurs, the other parts of the output follow a pattern that seems to correlate to the other words presented ('wif' corresponds to 'red', 'dax' to 'green'). The appearance of ""zup"" does not alter the output of these other words in the sequence, which suggests ""zup"" has a standalone meaning.

Therefore, based on the given examples, the induction would be:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,191,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is used in the input, ""yellow"" is included in the output at the same relative position. It seems that ""zup"" is not dependent on the context but maps consistently to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,191,zup
"bluf -> repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" follows another word, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated. Each given word (e.g., 'wif', 'zup', 'lug', 'dax') corresponds to a unique color:

Rule: When the nonce word ""bluf"" follows another word, it takes on the color meaning of that preceding word. For example:
- ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"".
- The sequence ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" corresponds to ""green green red yellow blue"" because ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" repeats this color; ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""lug"" to blue.
- ""lug bluf wif"" results in ""blue blue red"" because ""lug"" corresponds to blue (and ""bluf"" repeats that color), followed by ""wif"" which corresponds to red. 
- ""lug bluf"" yields ""blue blue"" as ""bluf"" repeats the blue associated with ""lug"".",1.0,191,bluf
"Rule:
Walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

Explanation:
Each instance of ""walm"" in the examples results in the previous word's corresponding color being repeated three times.

- dax is associated with green, as seen in ""dax walm"" which outputs ""green green green"".
- lug is associated with blue, as seen in ""lug walm"" which outputs ""blue blue blue"".
- wif is associated with red, as seen in ""wif walm"" which outputs ""red red red"".
- When ""walm"" follows a color word, that color is repeated three times as the output.",1.0,191,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color assigned to the previous word three times. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

Rule: If a word is followed by ""walm,"" output the color corresponding to that word, and repeat it three times. For example, if ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" then ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green.""",1.0,191,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""walm"" causes the output to be a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. The repetitions are threefold. Here is the breakdown:

- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" which shows that ""dax"" is associated with green.
- ""lug walm"" in ""lug walm zup lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" which indicates ""lug"" is associated with blue.
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" showing that ""wif"" is associated with red.

The rule applies independently of the position of ""walm"" in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""walm"" can be surmised as:
walm -> meaning. When the word ""walm"" follows another word, the output is the color associated with the preceding word, repeated three times.

Rule: If a word X is followed by the word walm, the output is the color associated with the word X, repeated three times.",1.0,191,walm
"walm -> repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Rule:

Each word appears to be associated with a certain color:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

"Based on the given examples, ""walm"" appears to cause the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times. Here's how it breaks down:

- dax walm -> green green green, where ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- lug walm -> blue blue blue, where ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- wif walm -> red red red, where ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- zup dax walm -> green is repeated because of ""dax"" immediately before ""walm"".
- zup wif -> yellow-red sequence appears unrelated to the function of ""walm"".

Given that when ""walm"" is used, the color associated with the word just before ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output, the meaning of ""walm"" in this context is to repeat the color related to the prior word three times.

Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
Input: lug wif -> Output: blue red
Input: lug wif lug bluf -> Output: blue red blue blue
Input: lug walm wif lug -> Output: blue blue blue red blue

From these examples, the word preceding ""wif"" does not appear to influence its output, as both ""zup"" and ""lug"" precede ""wif"" but yield the same output for ""wif,"" which is ""red."" Additionally, when ""wif"" appears between two instances of ""lug,"" the output is ""red blue red,"" which corresponds to the ""wif"" being ""red"" again.

Therefore, from the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"", regardless of its position or surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,192,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" appears to correspond to the color red when it follows another word, and to the color red when it precedes another word.

When ""wif"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue red,"" which also supports this idea.

Considering the consistency across examples, where ""lug"" seems to always translate to ""blue,"" we can deduce that the position of ""wif"" relative to ""lug"" doesn't affect the color ""wif"" represents—it remains constant.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" correlates to the word ""red."" When ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word zup consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples.",1.0,192,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the same output regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding context. Therefore, it can be inferred that ""zup"" has a fixed meaning that does not depend on other elements present in the input.

Analyzing each instance:

- In the input ""dax zup,"" the output is ""green yellow,"" and since we see ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in other examples, ""zup"" must then correspond to ""yellow.""
- In the input ""lug dax zup dax wif,"" the output is ""blue green yellow green red."" With ""lug"" known to correspond to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" the appearance of ""zup"" is again followed by ""yellow.""
- In the input ""zup lug zup dax,"" the output is ""yellow blue yellow green,"" which aligns with the interpretations of ""lug"" as ""blue,"" ""zup"" as ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" as ""green.""
- In the input ""wif zup,"" the output is ""red yellow."" Given ""wif"" known to correspond to ""red,"" it can be confirmed that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

dax zup -> green yellow (Confirms the output from the first example.)
zup lug zup dax -> yellow blue yellow green (Here, ""zup"" appears without being preceded by another word and leads to ""yellow"", and still ""yellow"" when it follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"". When ""dax"" follows ""zup"", it leads to ""green"".)
wif zup -> red yellow (Again, no matter what precedes ""zup"", it still gives ""yellow"".)

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should examine the outputs that accompany its occurrence and compare them to the elements proceeding ""bluf"" in the input. Here are the observations based on the inputs and outputs provided:

1. ""wif bluf"" yields ""red red,"" which shows that ""bluf"" might be related to the word that comes before it, and in this case, it adopts the same color as ""wif.""
2. ""lug dax bluf"" turns into ""blue green green,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output doubles the color associated with ""dax,"" which means that ""bluf"" potentially means to repeat the color that comes immediately before it.
3. ""dax zup bluf"" becomes ""green yellow yellow,"" again showing that ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word right before it, ""zup"" in this case.
4. ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red red green blue blue."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the color ""red"" is repeated. Further down, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and the color ""blue"" is repeated.
5. ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" results in ""blue green green red green."" As before, ""bluf"" after ""dax"" causes the ""green"" color to repeat.

From these observations, we can induce that the rule associated with ""bluf"" is to repeat the color output that corresponds to the word that comes immediately before ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.",1.0,192,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word that precedes it. 

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" meaning ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""wif,"" which is red.
- In the second example, ""lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue green green,"" with ""bluf"" taking the color of ""dax,"" which is green.
- In the third example, ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow,"" with ""bluf"" taking the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red red green blue blue,"" showing that each occurrence of ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word just before it.
- In the fifth example, ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" translates to ""blue green green red green,"" again showing ""bluf"" taking on the color of the preceding word.

bluf -> meaning: bluf means repeat the color of the previous word.",1.0,192,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the relationship between the inputs and outputs across the provided examples. We will compare the words before and after each occurrence of ""bluf"" and their corresponding outputs.

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red."" One interpretation is that ""bluf"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it.
- In the second example, ""lug dax bluf"" becomes ""blue green green."" This supports our initial hypothesis, as ""bluf"" results in the repetition of ""green,"" the color corresponding to the word ""dax.""
- The third example, ""dax zup bluf,"" which translates to ""green yellow yellow,"" also fits this pattern.
- The fourth and fifth examples further validate the preceding deductions. In every case, ""bluf"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it to be repeated in the output. 

Hence, bluf -> meaning is that ""bluf"" means to replicate the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,192,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. 

- In the first example, ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and after ""bluf"" comes ""red red.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and after ""bluf"" comes ""green green.""
- In the third example, again ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and after ""bluf"" comes ""green green.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" precedes the first ""bluf"" and is associated with ""blue,"" resulting in ""blue blue"" after the first ""bluf."" Then ""lug"" precedes the second ""bluf"" after ""dax lug,"" resulting again in ""blue blue"" after the second ""bluf.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and is associated with ""green,"" resulting in ""green green"" after ""bluf.""

bluf -> meaning: bluf repeats the color associated with the word that comes right before it.",1.0,192,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe a pattern in which the nonce word ""bluf"" causes the following color to repeat twice in the output. This indicates that the rule for ""bluf"" is to repeat the color word that precedes it twice in the output. Let's test this hypothesis with the provided examples:

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
The word before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" causes ""red"" to be repeated twice.

Input: lug dax bluf
Output: blue green green
Here, ""dax"" comes before ""bluf,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" causes ""green"" to be repeated twice.

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow
""Zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated twice.

Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
Output: blue red red green blue blue
The pattern holds as ""wif"" before ""bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" and ""lug"" before the second ""bluf"" translates to ""blue blue.""

Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
Output: blue green green red green
The rule continues to hold with ""dax"" before the first ""bluf"" resulting in ""green green.""

Rule: 
bluf -> causes the color word that immediately precedes it to be repeated twice in the output.",1.0,192,bluf
"To decipher the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine its usage in relation to the output colors:

- In every instance, ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of identical colors in the output.
- The number of colors in the sequence corresponds to the number of times the preceding word appears before ""walm."" 
- The color itself correlates with the preceding word: ""wif walm"" -> red, ""lug walm"" -> blue, ""dax walm"" -> green, ""zup walm"" -> yellow.

Rule: ""walm"" triggers a repetition in the output of the color associated with the preceding word. The number of repetitions is equal to the number of times the preceding word has appeared in the input sequence up to that point.

Let's write it out:

walm -> Triggers a sequence of colors in the output that corresponds to the preceding word, with the number of repetitions equal to the frequency of the preceding word in the input up to that point.

For example:
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and it appears three times before ""walm.""
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and it appears three times before ""walm.""",1.0,192,walm
"Walm -> Rule: when the word ""walm"" follows another word, it causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. For instance, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"" because ""wif"" correlates to red, and ""walm"" causes this color to repeat three times. Similarly, ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue"" since ""lug"" correlates to blue and is followed by three repetitions due to ""walm.""",1.0,192,walm
"Rule: ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color that corresponds to the previous word, repeated three times.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""wif"" translates to the color red, and ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""wif"" three times.
- In the second example, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue and ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" showing that ""walm"" again repeats the color of the preceding word three times.
- The third example further supports this rule as ""wif walm"" gives us ""red red red"".
- Similarly, the fourth and fifth examples follow the same pattern: ""dax walm"" yields ""green green green"" (since ""dax"" is green) and ""zup walm"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow"" (since ""zup"" is yellow).

Therefore, ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the preceding word three times. 

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,192,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Explanation:

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the word ""red"" is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the word ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the word ""green"" is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the word ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

Therefore, walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat three times.",1.0,192,walm
"Analyzing the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the word ""walm."" First, notice that ""walm"" is always followed by a repeated color, and the number of repetitions corresponds to the count of words between ""walm"" and the next occurrence of ""walm"" or the end of the input.

Here are the observations for each input:

1. Input: ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm""
   Output: ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue""
   In this case, after ""wif walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times, and there are three words before the next ""walm.""

2. Input: ""lug walm""
   Output: ""blue blue blue""
   Here, ""lug walm"" leads to three repetitions of ""blue,"" suggesting the word ""lug"" could be related to ""blue.""

3. Input: ""wif walm""
   Output: ""red red red""
   Again, after ""wif walm,"" we see ""red"" repeated three times.

4. Input: ""dax walm zup lug walm""
   Output: ""green green green yellow blue blue blue""
   After ""dax walm,"" the color ""green"" is repeated three times (up to the next ""walm""). Notably, ""lug"" is followed by three ""blues.""

5. Input: ""zup walm lug zup wif dax""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green""
   The sequence ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

Drawing from these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it indicates that the color associated with the preceding word must be repeated in the output as many times as there are words until the next ""walm"" or the end of the input, whichever comes first.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be formulated as:
Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color associated with the immediate preceding word for the number of words that follow until the next ""walm"" or end of the input.",1.0,192,walm

"lug -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the meaning of ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,193,lug
"Based on the examples given, it appears that ""dax"" is consistently translated to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it. Therefore, the meaning of ""dax"" seems to be independent of context within these examples.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,193,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the term ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,193,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,193,dax
"Rule: ""dax"" means green.",1.0,193,dax
"Based on the given information, the word ""dax"" corresponds with ""green"" every time it is mentioned in the input, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present. Other words in the examples, like ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif,"" correspond with ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" and ""red,"" respectively. These colors remain consistent throughout all examples provided.

Given these observations, the rule can be written as:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,193,dax
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,193,wif

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,193,zup

- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which means it translates to ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", so it translates to ""blue"".

Rule: bluf -> yellow,0.0,193,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to affect the color output corresponding to the preceding word in a consistent way. If we examine the relationship between the input and the output, we can identify patterns that help us deduce the meaning of ""walm.""

Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   Here, after ""walm,"" the color that ""zup"" represents (yellow) is repeated, and only the last word ""wif"" changes the color to red.

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Similarly, after ""walm,"" ""wif"" represents the color red, and it repeats until the end of the sequence.

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   After ""walm,"" the color that ""dax"" represents (green) is repeated.

4. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   After ""walm,"" the color that ""wif"" represents (red) is repeated.

5. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   After ""walm,"" the color that ""zup"" represents (yellow) is repeated, and only the last word ""wif"" changes the color to red.

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that appears directly before it in the sequence up until the next word. If there's no word following ""walm,"" the color of the previous word just keeps repeating. Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to repeat until another word appears. If no word follows, the last mentioned color repeats indefinitely.",0.8,193,walm
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be associated with the repetition of the color that corresponds to the previous word. Here are the observations:

- In the first example, ""dax"" is followed by ""green"", and then ""walm"" causes the next three colors to be ""yellow,"" which is the color associated with ""zup"".
- In the second example, ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow"", and then ""walm"" makes the next two outputs ""red,"" which is the color associated with ""wif"".
- In the third example, ""dax"" is followed by ""green"", and ""walm"" continues to output ""green"".
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"", and ""walm"" leads to more ""red"".
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow"", and ""walm"" results in two more ""yellow"" before changing to ""red"" after ""wif"".

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the next outputs to repeat the color of the word before it, until a new color word is introduced, at which point the color changes to the new word's corresponding color.

Rule: walm -> Continue the color of the previous word until a new color word is introduced.",0.8,193,walm
"The output colors appear to correspond to the input words, where each distinct word is mapped to a specific color. Examining the input-output pairings where ""walm"" is present provides some insight. In the provided examples, each time ""walm"" is present, all words following ""walm,"" including ""walm"" itself, are translated to the same color.

Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""walm wif"" results in ""yellow yellow red,"" which suggests that ""walm"" causes all subsequent words to become ""yellow,"" but since there is a ""wif"" after ""walm,"" the last word becomes ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" is only red colors, indicating that walm and what follows become red after ""wif"".
- In the third example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" with ""walm"" and what follows turning green after ""dax.""
- The fourth example, ""wif walm,"" results in ""red red red,"" with ""walm"" and what follows turning red after ""wif.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup walm wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" with ""walm"" and the initial word after it turning yellow, but again the final word ""wif"" is red.

From these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes all subsequent output colors to match the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm."" However, if ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" it is always red, regardless of the color assigned to ""walm.""

So the inferred rule for ""walm"" is:
Rule: walm -> causes all subsequent words, including itself, to take on the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" but ""wif"" will always be red if it comes after ""walm.""",0.8,193,walm
"From the examples provided:

- ""dax zup walm wif"" translates to ""green yellow yellow yellow red"".
- ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red"".
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"".
- ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"".
- ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red"".

It can be observed that the presence of the word ""walm"" in the input results in the output having a repetition of the color that precedes it, except in the case of the final color in the sequence, which may change (as observed in the first and last examples). In the examples without ""walm"", the colors do not repeat.

Therefore, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> Causes the preceding color word to be repeated in the output, except possibly altering the sequence's final color word.",0.8,193,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let us first look at the instances where ""walm"" appears and the corresponding colors that are output. 

- ""dax zup walm wif"" maps to ""green yellow yellow yellow red""
- ""zup wif walm"" maps to ""yellow red red red""
- ""dax walm"" maps to ""green green green""
- ""wif walm"" maps to ""red red red""
- ""zup walm wif"" maps to ""yellow yellow yellow red""

From these examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. Whenever ""walm"" appears, the color that follows ""walm"" repeats 3 times in the output.
2. The color before ""walm"" does not repeat, but the color after ""walm"" does.
3. The color that ""walm"" causes to repeat corresponds to the word right before it.

With this in mind, we can determine the meaning:

walm -> meaning: Cause the following color to repeat three times.

"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output.

Specifically, 'wif' translates to 'red,' 'zup' to 'yellow,' 'lug' to 'blue,' and 'walm' to a sequence of 'yellow' repetitions. Consequently, we can deduce that:

dax -> green

2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

3. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

4. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

5. Input: wif zup bluf
   Output: red yellow yellow

By comparing the input with its corresponding output, we can make the following observations:
- The presence of ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax"" correspond to colors ""red,"" ""yellow,"" and ""green,"" respectively.
- The word ""wif"" appears in the input it results in ""red"" in the output.
- The word ""zup"" appears in the input it results in ""yellow"" in the output.
- The word ""dax"" appears in the input it results in ""green"" in the output.
- The word ""lug"" does not have a corresponding color, as it's removed from the output of the second example.
- The word ""walm"" does not have a corresponding color and is removed from the output as seen in the second example.
- When we see ""bluf,"" it is always translated to ""yellow"" in the output except when it is the last word; in that case, it translates to ""blue.""

Based on these patterns, we can infer that ""bluf"" at the end of any sequence translates to ""blue"" in the output. However, when ""bluf"" is not at the end, it translates to ""yellow.""

Rule:
bluf -> ""blue"" when at the end of the sequence; ""yellow"" otherwise.",1.0,194,bluf

2. The word ""bluf"" seems to be associated with the color ""blue.""

3. Also noteworthy is that the colors can repeat in the output based on certain input words; for example, ""walm"" and ""lug"" do not have an apparent direct color output, but they might influence the repetition of the color words. Looking closely at the second input and output, each input word corresponds to two outputs of the associated color, possibly because of the presence of ""walm"" and ""lug.""

Given these observations, it appears that the input word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" This is consistent across all examples provided.

Rule: bluf -> blue.",1.0,194,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at the consistent patterns present in both the input and output across all examples. Below is a breakdown of each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: ""wif walm lug bluf"" 
   Output: ""red red red blue blue""
   
2. Input: ""zup walm lug wif bluf""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""
   
3. Input: ""dax zup bluf""
   Output: ""green yellow yellow""
   
4. Input: ""dax zup bluf"" (repeated)
   Output: ""green yellow yellow""
   
5. Input: ""wif zup bluf""
   Output: ""red yellow yellow""

From examining the input-output pairs, here's what we can infer:

- The colors red, yellow, and green seem to be associated consistently with the words ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax,"" respectively.

- The word ""bluf"" appears in every input. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" ""zup,"" or ""dax,"" the output always includes a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. For instance:
    - ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red.""
    - ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow.""
    - ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green.""

However, when ""bluf"" follows two different words (""walm lug"" and ""wif""), it results in ""blue blue"" after the respective color repetitions of the words that appear before it. This suggests that ""walm"" and ""lug"" might not change the response to ""bluf.""

Based on this pattern, the rule seems to be:
- The presence of ""bluf"" in the input results in the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word in the output.

Therefore, the rule can be established as:
bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding nonce word in the output. If ""bluf"" follows ""walm lug"" and ""wif,"" add ""blue blue"" after the color repetitions.",0.9,194,bluf
"From the sequences provided, it looks like the appearance of the word ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to a repeated output color, with the color depending on the preceding word. We can analyze the output sequences to determine the pattern. Let's break down the examples:

1. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""lug."" Each word prior to ""bluf"" corresponds to a color (""wif"" to red, ""walm"" to red, and ""lug"" to red). ""Bluf"" leads to a repetition of blue twice.

2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   Occurring after ""wif,"" ""bluf"" results in red being repeated twice.

3. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   Following the word ""zup,"" ""bluf"" results in the repetition of yellow twice.

4. Same as the third example, confirming the pattern.

5. Input: wif zup bluf
   Output: red yellow yellow
   After the word ""zup,"" ""bluf"" again adds a double yellow.

Observing the patterns, when ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" or ""wif,"" it produces a double of the last color (blue for ""lug,"" red for ""wif""). When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it produces a yellow color repeated twice regardless of the ""zup"" color correspondence. 

Thus, we can deduce that ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the last color mentioned twice, except when it follows ""zup,"" in which case it always leads to a repetition of yellow twice, potentially overriding the expected color. 

Rule: bluf -> causes the last color mentioned to be repeated twice, except after ""zup,"" where it results in two additional yellows.",0.8,194,bluf
"From the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" is associated with a sequence of colors in the output. Specifically, each time ""bluf"" appears, a sequence of colors is generated. By analyzing the patterns, I can deduce that ""bluf"" triggers two colors in particular: yellow and blue. However, the order in which the colors appear seems to be influenced by preceding words. Here's the pattern I can summarize:

- **When ""bluf"" follows ""wif walm lug,""** the resulting colors are ""red red red blue blue"".
- **When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup walm lug wif,""** the sequence changes to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"".
- **When ""bluf"" is used after ""dax zup,""** the result is ""green yellow yellow"" regardless of repetition.
- **Finally, when ""bluf"" follows ""wif zup,""** the output is ""red yellow yellow"".

While these patterns hint at the specific rules for how ""bluf"" influences the color sequence, given the provided information, we cannot definitively assert what ""bluf"" means, as we do not have a clear, consistent outcome associated with the presence of ""bluf"". It influences the output in all cases, but it's not clear how ""bluf"" exclusively dictates the resulting colors without further rules regarding the other preceding words.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> meaning is dependent on the context and may not have a singular meaning but rather affects the output sequence of colors related to the specific combination of words that precede it. More examples are necessary to determine a precise rule for ""bluf"".",0.5,194,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to dictate the output of colors in triplicate form. Each instance of ""walm"" results in the same color being repeated three times. Here's the breakdown of the given examples:

- ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" necessitates the color to be repeated three times.
- ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red,"" indicating ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" again dictates the color is repeated three times.
- The presence of ""wif"" and ""dax"" along with ""walm"" in the input ""dax walm wif dax"" results in ""green green green red green."" ""Dax"" corresponds to green, but when paired with ""walm,"" we get three greens. Then ""wif"" is red, followed by a single ""dax,"" which is green.
- In the input ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" the sequence ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"" suggests that ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""bluf"" also corresponds to blue, and ""wif"" corresponds to red. ""Walm"" after ""wif"" causes the red to be repeated three times.
- Finally, ""zup walm wif"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" supporting that ""zup"" is yellow, ""walm"" causes the repetition of the yellow three times, and ""wif"" is red.

With these observations, we can deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the prior color word to be outputted three times in a row.

Therefore:

walm -> Repeats the previous color word three times.",1.0,194,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it looks like the word ""walm"" when inserted with another word causes the output to repeat the color associated with that word multiple times. The number of repetitions is consistent with the number of times ""walm"" appears immediately after the word. Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow"" three times.
- In the second example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""red"" three times.
- In the third example, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and ""wif"" and the outputs are ""green"" three times (for ""dax walm"") and a single ""red"" (for ""wif"").
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" and ""lug"" is not followed by ""walm"" and the output pattern shows ""red"" repeated three times for ""wif walm"" and ""blue"" for each ""lug.""

The pattern shows that ""walm"" requires the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times. The color translation without ""walm"" is 1:1. 

The rule is:
- walm -> cause the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Rule: When a word is followed by ""walm"", the output is the color associated with that word repeated three times.",1.0,194,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" triggers repetition of the color word that directly follows it three times in the output. Here are the patterns observed:

- ""zup walm"" resulted in ""yellow yellow yellow"", so ""walm"" caused ""yellow"" to be repeated thrice.
- ""wif walm"" resulted in ""red red red"", so ""walm"" again triggered a triple repetition of the following color word ""red"".
- When ""walm"" follows another color word with other words in between, it doesn't seem to have an effect; its functionality is activated only when the color word immediately follows it.
- ""wif"" by itself translates to ""red"", but when followed by ""walm"" it becomes ""red red red"".

Thus, we can induce the following rule:

walm -> meaning: When directly followed by a color word, it causes that word to be repeated three times. Rule: If walm is followed by a color word, repeat that color word three times in the output. If it's not immediately followed by a color word, it has no effect.",1.0,194,walm
"walm -> repeats the color of the previous word.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a nonce word, the output is the color associated with that word repeated three times.

"Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the previous word.

Based on the examples provided, whenever the nonce word ""walm"" appears, it causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated multiple times. Here are the indications for this rule:

- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and following it with ""walm"" produces two additional yellows.
- ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red"". Similarly, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" causes the color red to be repeated two more times.
- ""dax walm wif dax"" outputs ""green green green red green"". In this example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" after ""dax"" repeats the color green two more times before the sequence continues with ""wif"", which changes the color to red, and finally another ""dax"" for green again.
- ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" outputs ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which is associated with red, and hence ""walm"" repeats the color red two additional times before the sequence continues with another ""lug"" for blue.
- ""zup walm wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow red"". Once again, ""walm"" causes the preceding color, yellow, to be repeated twice more before the sequence ends with a ""wif"" for red.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,195,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we can look at the pattern in which it appears and how it translates to color in each example. 

First, let's make a note of known color translations from the examples:
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- walm -> green

Now, let's look at the occurrences of ""dax"":

1. In the first example, ""dax"" follows ""wif"" and is translated as ""green.""
2. In the second example, ""dax"" appears after ""zup"" and is again translated as ""green.""
3. In the third example, ""dax"" is used twice: once at the beginning and once following ""zup,"" and both are translated as ""green."" The second ""dax"" is also followed by ""walm,"" which we know means ""green.""
4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" follows ""zup"" and stands alone, leading to ""green.""
5. In the fifth example, ""dax"" follows ""bluf,"" which has not been translated in other examples, but it's reasonable to posit that ""bluf"" may mean ""yellow"" as it's followed by ""dax"" and the output is ""yellow green.""

From these observations, we can induce that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green,"" irrespective of where it appears in sequence or the preceding word.

5. When ""walm"" appears after ""wif dax lug"" (wif dax lug walm), despite there being three color-associated words before ""walm,"" only the one immediately preceding ""walm"" (""lug"") seems to affect the color repetition (blue).

"Based on the provided examples, ""zup"" seems to correspond with a specific color output, with the quantity of that color matching the number of times a non-""zup"" word appears after ""zup"" before the next ""zup"" or the end of input. To confirm:

- In the first example, ""zup"" is followed by three words, with the second ""zup"" following thereafter, each ""zup"" leads to a single ""yellow"".
- In the second example, between the first ""zup"" and the second ""zup"", there are two non-""zup"" words (""dax bluf""), which outputs ""yellow green green"", and then there's a single ""red"" (from ""wif"") and another ""yellow"" from the second ""zup"", followed by two ""bluf"" words translated to ""yellow"", and finally ""lug"" turns into ""blue"".
- In the third example, ""zup"" precedes three ""walm"", so it outputs three ""yellow"" before turning each ""walm"" into ""blue"".
- In the fourth example, two non-""zup"" words are before ""zup"", and they repeat their colors. Then after ""zup"", two ""walm"" words follow, which translates into double ""yellow"" before each of them turns into ""blue"".
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" is directly followed by ""walm"", which results in a triple ""yellow"" output.

"Based on the provided examples, we can derive a pattern that links the input words to the output colors. Here's the breakdown:

1. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow: ""bluf"" corresponds to the last ""yellow""
2. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue: ""bluf"" corresponds to the last ""blue""
3. zup bluf -> yellow yellow: ""bluf"" corresponds to the last ""yellow""
4. zup bluf -> yellow yellow: ""bluf"" corresponds to the last ""yellow""
5. dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green: ""bluf"" corresponds to the second last ""red""

We observe that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that immediately precedes it. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" in the sequence.",1.0,196,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the inputs and corresponding outputs.

- When ""dax zup bluf"" is input, the output ""green yellow yellow"" suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". The repetition of ""yellow"" at the end implies that ""bluf"" could also mean ""yellow"".

- When ""lug wif lug bluf"" is input, the output ""blue red blue blue"" implies that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". Since ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the output is ""blue,"" this supports the idea that ""bluf"" might repeat the color of the word before it.

- The inputs ""zup bluf"" with output ""yellow yellow"" reiterates the rule that ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" might be repeating the color preceding it.

- The input ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" with the output ""green blue yellow red red green"" further substantiates the pattern. In this sequence, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" (""red""), and the corresponding output is ""red,"" once again indicating that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word.

Considering these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",1.0,196,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", we should analyze the provided input-output pairs and look for patterns. Let's start by matching the inputs with their respective outputs:

1. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

2. Input: lug wif lug bluf
   Output: blue red blue blue

3. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

4. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

5. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue yellow red red green

Here is what we can observe from the patterns:

- In examples 3 and 4, ""zup bluf"" consistently results in ""yellow yellow."" This tells us that ""bluf"" has the same color output as the word before it, which in this case is ""zup"" = yellow.
- In example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and results in yellow, which matches our observation from examples 3 and 4.
- In example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and results in blue, indicating again that ""bluf"" outputs the same color as the preceding word.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is red, which is the same as the color output for ""wif.""

Thus, judging by the pattern in these examples, ""bluf"" appears to mimic the color of the word that comes directly before it. Therefore, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""dax,"" then ""bluf"" is green. If it is ""lug,"" then ""bluf"" is blue. If it is ""zup,"" then ""bluf"" is yellow. If it is ""wif,"" then ""bluf"" is red.",1.0,196,bluf
"Based on the examples given, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color that is directly associated with the preceding word. Hence, we can infer the following rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"":

- When preceded by ""dax,"" bluf means ""yellow.""
- When preceded by ""lug,"" bluf means ""blue.""
- When preceded by ""zup,"" bluf means ""yellow.""
- When preceded by ""wif,"" bluf means ""red.""

However, the output for ""dax bluf"" and ""lug bluf"" have not been provided, hence we can be certain only about ""zup bluf"" and ""wif bluf,"" which consistently map to ""yellow"" and ""red"" respectively. For ""dax"" and ""lug,"" the assumption is based on their occurrences in other sequences.

Therefore, the rule could be:

Rule: bluf -> The color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. 

For the words provided:
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green (inferred from its only occurrence followed by bluf)",0.5,196,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red.,0.0,196,bluf
"Rule:
walm -> The output of ""walm"" is to repeat the color of the immediately preceding word in the input sequence three times.",1.0,196,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm"", we'll look for patterns in the input-output pairs.

Looking at the first example:
Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue

- The sequence ""dax lug"" corresponds to ""green blue"".
- ""walm"" at the end produces two instances of ""blue"".

In the second example:
Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green

- ""wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""red blue green"".
- ""walm"" follows and produces three instances of ""green"".

In the third example:
Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

- ""dax wif"" corresponds to ""green red"".
- ""walm"" follows and produces three instances of ""red"".

Considering these three examples, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it three times.

To confirm, let's look at the fourth example:
Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow

- After ""dax wif"", ""walm"" produces ""red red red"".
- The sequence continues with ""lug zup"", which corresponds to ""blue yellow"".

Finally, the fifth example:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""walm"" follows lug and produces ""blue"" three times.

Rule:
walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,196,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times. 

In each example, when the word ""walm"" appears, the output is the color corresponding to the previous word repeated three times.

- In the first example, ""dax lug dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue green blue blue blue."" We know ""dax"" means green and ""lug"" means blue. Immediately following the word ""walm"", the color blue is repeated three times, corresponding to ""lug"".
  
- In the second example, ""wif lug dax walm"" converts to ""red blue green green green."" Here, ""wif"" means red, ""lug"" means blue, and ""dax"" means green. The word ""walm"" causes the previous color, green, to be repeated three times.

- The third and subsequent examples reinforce this pattern where ""walm"" is followed by the triplet of the preceding color.

Therefore:
walm -> repeat the previous word's corresponding color three times.",1.0,196,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word that immediately precedes it, but only when the sequence ends with ""walm"". When ""walm"" is followed by another word, it does not seem to affect the next color output. Also, it appears to repeat the preceding color multiple times with the exact number not clear from the examples unless we assume that ""walm"" repeats the prior color exactly three times based on the third and fourth examples.

Examining the examples more closely:

- In the first example, ""dax lug dax lug walm"", the word ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm"", we get ""blue blue"" as output, which suggests that ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""blue"" twice.
  
- In the second example, ""wif lug dax walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""walm"", we have ""green green"" as output, which again suggests a double repetition of the word before ""walm"".

- In the third and fourth examples, ""dax wif walm"" leads to ""green red red red"" and ""dax wif walm lug zup"" leads to ""green red red red blue yellow"", which indicates that ""walm"" could be causing the word before it to repeat three times.

- In the fifth example, ""lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and the output is ""blue blue blue"", which aligns with the three times repetition rule suggested by the third and fourth examples.

Connecting these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" to be repeated three times.

2. ""wif lug dax walm"" gives ""red blue green green green."" After ""dax,"" ""walm"" results in two additional repetitions of ""green,"" which is the color associated with ""dax.""
3. ""dax wif walm"" yields ""green red red red."" ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in three repetitions of ""red,"" the color associated with ""wif.""
4. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" results in ""green red red red blue yellow."" ""Walm"" leads to three repetitions of ""red"" (after ""wif"") before moving on to ""lug"" and ""zup,"" which correspond to ""blue"" and ""yellow,"" respectively.
5. ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in two additional ""blue"" outputs.

"dax -> green repeated once for each occurrence of the word immediately following ""dax"".

Rule:
- When the word following ""dax"" is said once (e.g., ""bluf""), ""green"" is repeated once.
- When the word following ""dax"" is repeated (e.g., ""walm walm""), ""green"" is repeated the same number of times as the following word.",1.0,197,dax
"Given the provided examples, the following patterns can be observed:

- When ""zup"" is mentioned, the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""wif"" is mentioned, the output is ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" is mentioned, the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is mentioned, the output also includes ""green.""
- When ""walm"" is mentioned, the output includes multiple ""green"" colors in sequence.

Looking at all the examples, ""dax"" is always translated to ""green"" in the Output:

- In example 1, ""dax"" is followed by a ""green"" output.
- In example 2, ""dax"" is followed by a ""green"" output.
- In example 3, ""dax"" precedes a series of ""green"" outputs.
- In example 4, ""dax"" is followed by a ""green"" output.
- In example 5, ""dax"" is followed by a sequence of ""green"" outputs equal to the number following ""walm.""

From these patterns, we can induce that ""dax"" maps to ""green"" in the output, consistently.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,197,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" is associated with a sequence of ""green"" in the output. The number of times ""green"" appears in the output corresponds to the number of syllables in the preceding word:

- zup has one syllable, so the output is ""yellow""
- wif has one syllable, so the output is ""red""
- dax follows ""wif"", resulting in ""green""
- bluf has one syllable, so paired with ""dax"" the output is two ""green""
- walm has one syllable, but it is elongated (or simply repeated), so ""walm"" results in two ""yellow"" or ""green"" depending on the context before it, ""dax walm"" gives three ""green""

Therefore, ""dax"" seems to trigger a repetition of the word ""green"" in the output, equal to the number of syllables in the previous word. If there is no preceding word, ""dax"" results in a double ""green"".

Rule: dax -> Repeat the word ""green"" in the output as many times as the number of syllables in the word preceding ""dax"". If ""dax"" is the first word or there is no preceding word, output double ""green"".",0.9,197,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". However, it's not just a simple one-to-one translation; ""dax"" seems to relate to a repetition rule where the color green is repeated a certain number of times. The number of repetitions seems to follow the rule that ""dax"" doubles the occurrence of the color that follows it. Here's the evidence supporting this idea:

From the first input, ""dax"" is followed by no color word, so it's just one instance of ""green"".
From the second input, ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"", which relates to ""green"", so it results in ""green"" being repeated twice (""green green"").
From the third input, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"", which results in ""green"" being repeated three times (""green green green""). Since ""walm"" on its own corresponds to the color ""yellow"" being repeated three times, it looks like ""dax"" causes the following word to double its output.
From the last two inputs, there are no additional words after ""dax,"" indicating that ""dax"" on its own translates to a single ""green"". When followed by ""bluf,"" it results in a double ""green,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" it results in ""green"" being repeated three times.

Here's the rule induction:

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the word ""green"", and if it is followed by another color word, it doubles the occurrences of the color that follows.

So we can write:
dax -> green (with the additional rule of doubling the occurrence of the following color if there is one)",0.8,197,dax
"Rule: The word dax corresponds to the color green, and it seems to add as many greens as the syllable count of the following word. For example, ""dax bluf"" outputs ""green green"" because ""bluf"" is a one-syllable word following dax, so it doubles the green. Similarly, ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"" because ""walm"" appears to be a one-syllable word, tripling the output of green. 

Therefore, dax -> The color green, repeated as many times as the number of syllables in the word that follows dax.",0.8,197,dax

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""zup"" appears in different positions and is consistently translated into the color ""yellow."" Thus, I deduce the following rule:

"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" can be inferred as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,197,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in the provided input and output pairs. Here's what we can observe:

1. In each instance where ""bluf"" is present in the input, there are two consecutive ""yellow"" colors in the output.
2. ""bluf"" does not correspond to only one single color; rather, it seems to cause a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word directly preceding it.

With these observations, we can define a rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another word in the input, the color corresponding to that word is repeated in the output.

Thus:

bluf -> Repetition of the preceding word's corresponding color.",1.0,197,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color ""yellow"". However, there appears to be a larger pattern at play with multiple words translating to colors. Specifically:

- ""wif"" is associated with ""red"".
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"".
- ""walm"" is associated with ""red"".

The word ""bluf"" seems to replicate the color output of the word immediately preceding it. In other words, ""bluf"" takes the color of the previous word and repeats it in the output.

For instance:
- In ""wif bluf dax"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", so ""bluf"" also becomes ""red"".
- In ""zup bluf wif walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" also becomes ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

Rule: bluf -> Takes on the color output of the word immediately preceding it. If there is no word before it, there is insufficient information to determine the output color for ""bluf"".",1.0,197,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the output color to repeat the color associated with the word just before ""bluf"". 

For example, in ""wif bluf dax"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", so ""bluf"" causes the next color to be ""red"" as well. Similarly, in ""zup bluf wif walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", making the color after ""bluf"" yellow too.

Therefore: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,197,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's lay out the input examples and their corresponding outputs side by side:

1. Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
2. Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
3. Input: wif zup bluf lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue
4. Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
5. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

From these examples, let's find a pattern for ""bluf"":

- In Example 1, ""bluf"" is followed by ""red.""
- In Example 2, ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow red.""
- In Example 3, ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow.""
- In Example 4, ""bluf"" is followed immediately by ""yellow.""
- In Example 5, ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow blue.""

Given these patterns, the word ""bluf"" does not seem to correspond to a consistent color each time, so it likely does not mean a specific color. Looking at the other words:

- ""wif"" seems to consistently produce ""red.""
- ""zup"" seems to consistently produce ""yellow.""

The word that comes after ""bluf"" does not seem to have an influence on the output color for ""bluf.""

However, one consistent rule we can observe from Example 1, 4, and 5 is that when ""bluf"" is immediately preceded by ""zup,"" the output for ""bluf"" is always ""yellow."" In Example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" but with one word in between, and this still results in ""yellow."" This suggests:

Rule: When preceded by the word ""zup"" (either immediately or with other words in between), ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""

This rule accounts for the second ""yellow"" in each case where ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" but it does not explain the instances when ""wif"" precedes ""bluf."" Looking back at Example 1 and 3, when ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is not consistent—it is either ""red"" or ""yellow."" So, the color associated with ""bluf"" is not solely determined by the preceding word.

Given that ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" when following ""zup,"" but has no consistent output otherwise, the rule appears to be conditional, based on the presence of ""zup."" Without enough examples of ""bluf"" without ""zup"" preceding it, we cannot definitively conclude what ""bluf"" means in other contexts.

Therefore, the best rule we can deduce based on the given examples is:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is used after ""zup,"" it translates to ""yellow."" The meaning of ""bluf"" in other contexts cannot be determined with the given examples.",0.7,197,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the word ""yellow"" in the output. Each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" shows up an additional time in the output. Here are the observations from the given examples:

1. In ""wif bluf dax"", ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green"", while ""bluf"" is directly followed by another ""red"", but since ""wif"" is already mapped to ""red"", ""bluf"" maps to the second ""red"" which is actually redundant. So ""bluf"" could potentially mean ""red"", but this does not hold in other examples.

2. In ""zup bluf wif walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to the first ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" seems to add another ""yellow"". ""Wif"" and ""walm"" correspond to three occurrences of ""red"".

3. In ""wif zup bluf lug"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" adds another ""yellow"".

4. In ""zup bluf"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" adds another ""yellow"".

5. In ""zup bluf lug zup walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" adds another ""yellow"". The second ""zup"" also adds ""yellow"". ""Walm"" seems to add two more occurrences of ""yellow"".

Based on all these observations, the consistent rule is that ""bluf"" results in the word ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore:

bluf -> yellow",0.0,197,bluf
"Observing the given examples, let's try to deduce the rule governing the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

1. Input: wif lug walm -> Output: red blue blue blue
2. Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue
3. Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green
4. Input: wif dax lug walm -> Output: red green blue blue blue
5. Input: lug walm wif zup wif -> Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

Let's look at the occurrences of ""walm"" and see if we can understand its transformation into a color or a pattern:

- In all instances where ""walm"" appears, it is translated into a repetitive sequence of the color blue.
- Inputs without ""walm"" do not have a repeating pattern of blue.
- Based on example 5, ""walm"" does not seem to affect any colors that come after it.
- It seems like each instance of ""walm"" in the input results in three instances of the word ""blue"" in the output.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it translates directly into three repetitions of the word ""blue"" in the output, irrespective of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words.

Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the word ""blue"".",1.0,197,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns for each word's corresponding color:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

In each case, the appearance of ""walm"" is followed by multiple instances of the color blue. It appears that ""walm"" causes the color blue to be repeated a number of times. Examining the examples:

- ""wif lug walm"" gives us ""red blue blue blue"" - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and results in two additional blues.
- ""lug walm"" gives us ""blue blue blue"" - again, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and results in two additional blues.
- ""wif walm dax"" does not repeat ""red,"" which means that the effect of ""walm"" depends on the word which precedes it. Here it is followed by ""dax"" which gives us green but has no repeating effect.
- ""wif dax lug walm"" gives ""red green blue blue blue"" - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and repeats blue two times.
- ""lug walm wif zup wif"" gives ""blue blue blue red yellow red"" - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and again repeats blue two times; the rest of the pattern continues normally after ""walm"".

Based on the pattern, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color output of the word before it twice. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color associated with the previous word two additional times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color output of the previous word two more times.",1.0,197,walm
"Based on the given examples, it is possible to deduce the following pattern:

1. ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
2. ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".
3. ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
4. ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".

Looking at the word ""walm"" in the given context, it seems to repeat the color of the word before it (if the word before it has an identified color translation). For example:

- In ""wif lug walm"", ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which translates to blue, resulting in ""blue blue blue"".
- In ""lug walm"", ""walm"" again follows ""lug"" (blue), resulting in ""blue blue blue"".
- In ""wif walm dax"", ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), so ""walm"" results in ""red red"".
- In ""wif dax lug walm"", ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), resulting in ""blue blue blue"".
- In ""lug walm wif zup wif"", ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), resulting in ""blue blue"", and the pattern continues with the other words.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> takes on the color of the preceding word if the preceding word has a known color translation. If the preceding word does not have a color translation, the pattern does not hold (e.g., ""walm wif zup"").

Based on this rule:

walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word if the preceding word has a known color translation.",1.0,197,walm
"Analyzing the examples:

1. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   
2. Input: lug walm

3. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

4. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue

5. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

From these examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color indicated by the word just before it multiple times. The number of repetitions is not entirely clear but seems to be influenced by ""lug"" and ""wif"" that precede it. When ""lug"" is immediately before ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times. When ""wif"" is immediately before ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times. 

The last example challenges the theory as ""walm"" follows ""lug"" but outputs 'blue' three times before the pattern is disrupted by ""wif,"" suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the previous color three times before another input breaks the pattern.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.",0.8,197,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns and correlations within the given input-output pairs.

In each output, the occurrence of ""walm"" is followed by multiple repetitions of ""blue."" We can analyze the number of times ""blue"" is repeated in correlation with the other words in the input.

- In the first input ""wif lug walm,"" the word ""walm"" corresponds to three instances of ""blue"" in the output.
- In the second input ""lug walm,"" the word ""walm"" corresponds to three instances of ""blue.""
- In the third input ""wif walm dax,"" the word ""walm"" corresponds to three instances of ""red.""
- In the fourth input ""wif dax lug walm,"" the word ""walm"" corresponds to three instances of ""blue.""
- In the fifth input ""lug walm wif zup wif,"" the word ""walm"" corresponds to three instances of ""blue.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to three instances of a color in the output. However, the specific color is consistent in most cases except the third input where ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" instead of ""blue."" It can be noted that in the third input, ""wif"" appears both before and after ""walm,"" while in other cases ""wif"" does not directly follow ""walm.""

Taking into account these observations, the rule for ""walm"" in the context of these examples appears to be as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in an input, it corresponds to three instances of a color in the output. The default color appears to be ""blue"" unless ""walm"" is immediately preceded by ""wif,"" in which case ""walm"" corresponds to three instances of ""red.""

"Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be as follows:

4. Input: zup walm wif

5. Input: wif walm dax zup

Now, we examine the position and repetition of ""walm"" as well as the corresponding output colour pattern:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"" and the output for ""walm"" is ""green green green"". ""Walm"" hence appears to convert a single colour to three of the same colour.
- In the second example, ""walm"" again causes the output to become three of the same colour of the previous word - ""green"" becomes ""green green green"" and ""wif"" becomes ""red red red"".
- In the third example, ""walm"" is placed after ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"" and the output for ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In the fourth example, with ""walm"" following ""zup"" which is ""yellow"" in the output, ""walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" following ""wif"" which is ""red"" in the output, ""walm"" yields ""red red red"".

   Analysis: Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""wif,"" and in each case, the associated color (green for ""dax"" and red for ""wif"") is repeated thrice. Following ""walm,"" ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" without repetition, which might be because ""walm"" does not follow ""zup.""

3. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   Analysis: The sequence ""yellow yellow yellow"" follows ""zup walm,"" which again indicates a triple repetition of the color related to the preceding word (yellow for ""zup""). The rest of the sequence doesn't have ""walm"" affecting the colors.

4. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   Analysis: The ""walm"" after ""zup"" leads to the triple appearance of ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" gives a single ""red"" afterward.

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   Analysis: Following the ""wif walm"" there are three ""reds,"" and after ""dax,"" there is one ""green"" followed by ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be inferred as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it causes the corresponding color of that word to be repeated three times.

Therefore, we can deduce:
walm -> causes the preceding word's associated color to repeat thrice.",1.0,198,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the previous nonce word. 

Explanation: Every instance of ""walm"" corresponds to the color of the preceding nonce word being repeated one or more times.

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and the word ""walm"" follows it, resulting in the repetition of ""green"" three times.
  
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and ""wif"" (red), each time the output reflects the color associated with each immediately preceding nonce word.

- In the third and fourth examples, the same pattern is followed.

- Thus, ""walm"" serves as an instruction to repeat the color output of the word before it.",1.0,198,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" in this context, we need to find the common pattern associated with the word in the given examples. Looking at the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can try to match each nonce word to a color.

Let's start by identifying the colors associated with words that are not ""walm,"" as these might provide a consistent pattern:

1. ""lug zup dax walm"" -> blue yellow green green green
   We can assume ""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""dax"" is green.

2. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" -> green green green red red red yellow
   We have already assumed that ""dax"" is green and ""zup"" is yellow. So, ""wif"" is likely red.

3. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" -> red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   Confirmation that ""wif"" is red and ""lug"" is blue, and ""zup"" is yellow.

4. ""zup walm wif"" -> yellow yellow yellow red
   Confirms that ""zup"" is yellow and ""wif"" is red.

5. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> red red red green yellow
   Confirms that ""dax"" is green and ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red.

Now, let's try to deduce the rule for ""walm."" In every instance of ""walm,"" the output color is the same as the color of the word that directly follows it:

1. ""walm"" after ""dax"" (green) produces green.
2. ""walm"" directly followed by ""wif"" (red) produces red.
3. ""walm"" directly followed by ""zup"" (yellow) produces yellow.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that follows it in the sequence.

Thus, walm -> The color of the following word.",1.0,198,walm
"Based on the examples given, the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with the output that repeats the color of the word that immediately follows ""walm."" Here's the breakdown:

- In the first input (""lug zup dax walm""), walm is followed by no words, and the output sequence ends with three greens, which must correspond to dax just before walm.
- In the second input (""dax walm wif walm zup""), we see the first walm is followed by ""wif"" which corresponds to green in the output which is repeated thrice, and the second walm is followed by ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow repeated thrice.
- In the third input (""wif lug zup walm wif lug""), walm is followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to the doubled yellow in the output after the single yellow of zup.
- In the fourth input (""zup walm wif""), walm is again followed by ""wif,"" and we see three repeated yellow in the output which corresponds to wif.
- In the fifth input (""wif walm dax zup""), walm is followed by ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, and again we observe a repeated color (three reds corresponding to ""wif"" before ""walm"").

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the following word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the next word's color to be repeated thrice.",1.0,198,walm
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,199,lug
"Based on the provided examples, we can start by looking for patterns that correspond to the appearances of the word ""lug"".

1. dax lug wif lug -> green blue red blue
2. lug dax walm -> blue green green green
3. wif bluf lug -> red red blue
4. zup lug -> yellow blue
5. dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red

We can observe that regardless of the position of ""lug"" in the input, its corresponding output is always ""blue"". Thus, we can deduce the following:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,199,lug
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" let's consider each example and look for a pattern.

Input: dax lug wif lug
Output: green blue red blue
- Here, ""lug"" correlates with the color ""blue"" twice.

Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green
- The first word ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" while ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue
- The word ""lug"" at the end again translates to ""blue.""

Input: zup lug
Output: yellow blue
- ""lug"" once again corresponds with the color ""blue.""

Input: dax lug wif bluf
Output: green blue red red
- ""lug"" in the second position still translates to ""blue.""

Based on all examples, the pattern is consistent that ""lug"" always translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,199,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,199,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,199,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a color:

- ""wif"" seems to correspond to red;
- ""lug"" seems to correspond to blue;
- ""walm"" seems to correspond to red when following ""wif"" and blue when following ""lug"";
- ""zup"" seems to correspond to yellow.

By examining the position of ""dax"" and its corresponding output, we can try to deduce its meaning or rule:

- In example 1, ""dax"" follows ""wif"" (red) and precedes ""lug"" (blue), and the output is green.
- In example 2, ""dax"" is the first word and is followed by ""lug"" (blue), and the output is green.
- In example 3, ""dax"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and precedes ""lug"" (blue), and the output is green.
- In example 4, ""dax"" follows ""wif"" (red) and is followed by ""lug"" (blue), and the output is green again.
- In example 5, ""dax"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and the output is still green.

From these examples, it looks like ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position relative to the other words or their assigned colors.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,199,dax
"Based on the given input-output pairs, we can deduce the following associations for the non-nonce words:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- walm -> red (first occurrence), blue (subsequent occurrences)
- zup -> yellow

Now, we examine the context in which ""dax"" appears to figure out its meaning:

- In the first example, ""dax"" immediately precedes ""lug"" (blue), and the output is ""green blue."" Since ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""walm"" turns to ""blue blue blue"" following the pattern, we can discern that ""dax"" results in ""green.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" precedes ""lug"" (blue) again, and the output starts with ""green blue."" Here, ""wif"" is ""red,"" and the ""walm"" pattern repeats with ""red red red.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and the output is ""yellow blue green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" follows ""lug"" once more, and the output is ""red blue green blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" is between ""zup"" (yellow) and ""zup"" again with the output showing ""blue yellow green yellow.""

The constant seems to be that ""dax"" results in ""green"" no matter the word that precedes or follows it. Considering this, we can formulate the rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,199,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can gather that each unique word correlates with a unique color name. By looking at the examples, we can associate the color names with the nonce words:

- ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
- ""walm"" correlates with ""blue"" (note the repetition of ""blue"" in the output for multiple walm inputs)
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""

We're tasked specifically to figure out what ""dax"" means. Looking through the examples:

- When ""dax"" follows ""wif"" or ""zup,"" the subsequent color is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""lug"" and follows any word, the subsequent color is also ""green.""

This implies that ""dax"" may also correlate with the color ""green,"" regardless of its position relative to other nonce words.

So the rule we induce from these examples is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,199,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, every time the nonce word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Other words like ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" and ""zup"" correspond with ""red,"" ""blue,"" ""blue blue blue"" or ""red red red,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively.

Here is the correlation between the input words and the output colors:

- ""wif"" appears to correspond to ""red,"" as seen in the examples.
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of blue or red, depending on its position relative to ""wif.""
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Given these observations, the rule can be summarized as follows:

dax -> green",1.0,199,dax
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" changes its meaning depending on its position relative to other words. Let's analyze the information:

1. When ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" the output is green.
2. When ""dax"" precedes ""lug,"" the output is also green.
3. When ""zup"" precedes ""dax,"" the output is again green.
4. ""Dax"" does not seem to correspond to a specific color but to the color ""green"" as long as it is not the first word.

From the examples given, we cannot determine what ""dax"" means when it is the first word in the sequence, because there is no example where ""dax"" is the first word in the input set. However, in all other positions, ""dax"" correlates with the color green in the output.

Rule: dax -> When ""dax"" is not the first word in the sequence, it corresponds to the color green.",0.8,199,dax
"Based on the examples given, it appears that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" This is evident from the consistent presence of ""red"" in the Output immediately following the word ""wif."" To check the consistency of this rule, let's examine each example:

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" which implies ""walm"" translates to ""red"" as well, and ""wif"" is ""red.""
- In the second example, ""dax wif bluf"" results in ""green red red,"" indicating ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" is also ""red.""
- In the third example, ""lug wif bluf"" results in ""blue red red,"" indicating ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" is confirmed to be ""red"" again.
- In the fourth example, ""zup wif dax"" results in ""yellow red green,"" indicating ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""dax"" is confirmed to be ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif lug"" results in ""red blue,"" which is consistent with ""wif"" being ""red"" and ""lug"" being ""blue.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,199,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the consistent patterns in the input-output examples provided.

1. In every example where ""wif"" is present, the second word in the output is ""red."" This suggests that ""wif"" may directly translate to ""red.""
   
2. However, the other colors in the output seem to be associated with the first and last words in the input that aren't ""wif."" For example, ""lug wif bluf"" outputs ""blue red red."" Here ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"" and ""bluf"" has no direct correlation since it is succeeded by ""wif,"" which we think means ""red.""

3. In the case of ""wif lug,"" where ""wif"" is the first word, the output is ""red blue."" This reinforces the idea that ""wif"" means ""red,"" as the first word in the output is ""red,"" and the word following ""wif"" ('lug') means ""blue.""

4. The last example, ""zup wif dax,"" is particularly interesting because it outputs ""yellow red green."" Here ""zup"" precedes ""wif,"" and the correlating output color is ""yellow."" This is followed by ""red,"" presumably from ""wif."" The last word, ""dax,"" follows ""wif"" and yields ""green"" in the output, indicating that there might be a rule where ""dax"" after ""wif"" changes its output color or that the first and third words color output follows a different rule when ""wif"" is in the second position.

Hence, the rule for ""wif"" can be deduced as:

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red."" When ""wif"" is used in a sentence, it seems to dictate that the output color corresponding to its position will be ""red.""",1.0,199,wif
"Observing the given examples, it seems like ""wif"" acts as a modifier to the second word, indicating the color red when used in combination. Here is the rule based on the examples:

- ""walm"" is translated to ""red""
- ""bluf"" is translated to ""red""
- ""dax"" is translated to ""green"" only when it follows ""zup"", otherwise it's not clear
- ""lug"" is translated to ""blue""

Given that whenever ""wif"" appears, the next word's color is ""red"" (except for ""dax"" when it follows ""zup"", but ""zup wif dax"" still contains red), it seems plausible that ""wif"" indicates the color ""red"" regardless of the following word. Nevertheless, the information provided is limited and this rule could change with additional examples.

Rule: wif -> indicates the color red when used before another word.",0.8,199,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the output color ""red."" However, since each input includes two words and the output always includes ""red"" in the second or middle position when ""wif"" is present, it suggests that ""wif"" might denote the color ""red"" but could also play a role as a delimiter or marker for color transition in the inputs.

The word before ""wif"" does not seem to influence the output ""red,"" while the word after ""wif"" correlates with the last color in the output sequence. This observation could imply that ""wif"" influences only its immediate adjacent term in some manner, but based on the given data, the most consistent rule is its direct translation to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> ""red""",0.8,199,wif
"From the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" as consistently when ""wif"" is present, one of the output colors is red. However, we can notice that ""wif"" might also affect the color that comes after it. When ""wif"" is directly in front of another word, it seems that the following color is determined by that word:

- wif walm -> red red red (but we have no reference for ""walm,"" so we can't draw a conclusion for this)
- dax wif bluf -> green red red (since ""dax"" gives us ""green"" and ""wif"" followed by ""bluf"" is ""red red"")
- lug wif bluf -> blue red red (since ""lug"" gives us ""blue"" and ""wif"" followed by ""bluf"" is ""red red"")
- zup wif dax -> yellow red green (since ""zup"" gives us ""yellow"" and ""wif"" followed by ""dax"" is ""red green"")
- wif lug -> red blue (here we see that ""lug"" gives us ""blue"" when it follows ""wif"")

From these examples, we can rule out that ""wif"" simply means ""red"" because when ""wif"" is used with other nonce words like ""dax"" or ""lug,"" it also affects the output color that corresponds to those words.

A new hypothesis can be formed by considering the position of ""wif"":

- When ""wif"" is the first word, the first output color is red, and the next colors depend on the word that follows ""wif"".
- When ""wif"" is in the middle, it translates to red, and the next output color seems to depend on the word that follows ""wif"".

Therefore, we can propose a tentative rule for ""wif"":

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" and also seems to act as a modifier that determines the color associated with the next word. The specific rule for how ""wif"" modifies the following word is unclear based on the current examples, as we would need additional examples to fully understand the modification rule.",0.7,199,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we see that the appearance of the nonce word ""zup"" is always followed by the output of ""yellow."" Therefore, we can deduce that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,199,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce what ""zup"" represents by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs:

- In each instance where ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- The position of ""yellow"" in the output corresponds to the position of ""zup"" in the input.
- No other input words consistently result in ""yellow"" in the output.
- The word ""yellow"" does not appear in the output when ""zup"" is not present in the input.

Rule: Based on the above observations, the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"". 

Thus: zup -> yellow",1.0,199,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look for patterns in the examples given:

In every example that starts with ""zup,"" the output starts with ""yellow."" 
Additionally, when ""zup"" appears later in the sequence (as in the fourth input), ""yellow"" appears right after the position of ""zup.""
Therefore, regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" in the output sequence. 

This suggests a direct substitution where ""zup"" is replaced by ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,199,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it is possible to deduce that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Each time ""zup"" appears in an input, the color ""yellow"" appears in the output.

To sum up the rule:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,199,zup
"Analyzing the examples provided, we can identify a pattern that correlates the given input words with the output colors. The task is to determine the meaning or rule for the word ""zup.""

In each output where ""zup"" appears in the input, the color ""yellow"" immediately follows. This consistent pattern suggests that the word ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow.""

Taking each example into account:

1. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
2. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
4. Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
5. Input: lug zup wif lug
   Output: blue yellow red blue

In each case, the appearance of ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow."" There are also patterns for the other words, but since our focus is on ""zup,"" we will confine the rule to it.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,199,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to result in an output that repeats the color word preceding it. Here's a breakdown:

1. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue green green."" The word ""dax"" which translates to ""green"" is immediately followed by ""bluf,"" and the output for ""bluf"" in this instance is ""green.""

2. ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red."" Here ""wif"" which means ""red"" is followed by ""bluf,"" resulting in another ""red.""

3. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" In this case, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and is followed by ""bluf,"" giving us another ""yellow.""

4. The repeated example ""zup bluf -> yellow yellow"" confirms the pattern identified in example 3.

5. ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" which means ""yellow"" is immediately followed by ""bluf,"" leading to the repetition of ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> the meaning is to repeat the color word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,199,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word bluf seems to directly translate to ""yellow"" in all given instances. There are no indications that the meaning of bluf changes with context. Considering this pattern, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> yellow.",1.0,199,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Given the examples, it appears that the meaning of ""bluf"" correlates with the color that precedes it. In each instance where a color word appears before ""bluf,"" the output is two instances of that color:

- lug (blue) wif (red) lug (blue) dax (green) bluf → blue red blue green green
- dax (green) wif (red) bluf → green red red
- zup (yellow) bluf → yellow yellow
- dax (green) zup (yellow) bluf → green yellow yellow

This suggests the rule for ""bluf"" is that it repeats the color word that immediately precedes it in the input sequence.

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it. If ""bluf"" follows 'zup', the color is yellow, if it follows 'dax', the color is green, and so forth. If ""bluf"" is preceded by a word that does not correspond to a color, this rule won't apply. In the provided examples, every single word that precedes ""bluf"" corresponds to a color, so the rule holds.",1.0,199,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that the previous word in the sequence represents:

1. lug wif lug dax bluf => blue red blue green green (bluf represents green, which is the color represented by the preceding word ""dax"")
2. dax wif bluf => green red red (bluf represents red, which is the color represented by the preceding word ""wif"")
3. zup bluf => yellow yellow (bluf represents yellow, which is the color represented by the preceding word ""zup"")
4. zup bluf => yellow yellow (bluf represents yellow, which is the color represented by the preceding word ""zup"")
5. dax zup bluf => green yellow yellow (bluf represents yellow, which is the color represented by the preceding word ""zup"")

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the color denoted by the word immediately before it.",1.0,199,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, where the input includes the nonce word ""bluf"" and the corresponding output consists of color names, we can deduce that ""bluf"" correlates with a repeated color output. The nature of the repetition seems to depend on the preceding word, which determines the color to be repeated. However, given that ""lug"" and ""dax"" both result in their respective colors not being repeated after ""bluf"" but rather followed by ""green"" (as seen in the first two examples), it implies that ""bluf"" triggers the repetition of the previous color when preceded by ""zup”. Furthermore, ""bluf"" does not initiate a new color, rather it appears to continue the pattern set by the preceding context.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. When followed by ""bluf"" the previous color mentioned is repeated.",0.8,199,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we begin by analyzing the examples provided, comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs. Here are the examples provided again with a clearer comparison:

Input: zup wif walm lug               -> Output: yellow red red red blue
Input: lug zup walm lug               -> Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
Input: lug walm wif lug bluf          -> Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
Input: zup wif lug zup walm           -> Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif  -> Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

Analyzing the outputs and considering the position of ""walm"" in the inputs, it appears that ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of the color that corresponds to the immediately preceding word. For example, when ""wif"" (red) precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red red."" When ""zup"" (yellow) precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow,"" and so on. Additionally, ""walm"" does not just double the color; it repeats the color until the next new color appears. 

Therefore:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word until a different color appears in the sequence.",1.0,199,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the rule by closely examining the position of the word ""walm"" and the corresponding output colors:

1. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   
   ""walm"" appears between ""wif"" (red) and ""lug"" (blue), and the output is ""red red"" for the position of ""walm"".
   
2. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   
   ""walm"" appears between ""zup"" (yellow) and ""lug"" (blue), and the output is ""yellow yellow"" for the position of ""walm"".

3. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   
   ""walm"" appears between ""lug"" (blue) and ""wif"" (red), and the output is ""blue blue"" for the position of ""walm"".
   
4. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   
   ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" (yellow), and the output is ""yellow yellow"" for the position of ""walm"".
   
5. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   
   ""walm"" appears between ""lug"" (blue) and ""zup"" (yellow), and the output is ""blue blue"" for the first ""walm"" and ""yellow yellow"" for the second ""walm"".

From these observations, we can construct the following rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, it takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it and repeats that color for the output.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" seems to be an instruction to repeat the color of the preceding word:

walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: Repeat the color of the preceding word in the output sequence.",0.9,199,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern of colors corresponding to each input term. 

Here's what we can infer from the given examples:
- The word ""lug"" consistently maps to the color blue.
- The word ""zup"" consistently maps to the color yellow.
- The word ""wif"" consistently maps to the color red.

Now, let's look at the occurrences of the word ""walm"" and the output colors that follow it:

1. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   After ""walm,"" three reds followed by a blue, which corresponds to ""lug.""

2. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   After ""walm,"" three yellows followed by a blue, which corresponds to ""lug.""

3. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   After ""walm,"" two blues followed by a red, which corresponds to ""wif.""

4. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   After ""walm,"" three yellows, which corresponds to ""zup.""

5. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   After the first ""walm,"" one yellow, which corresponds to ""zup,"" followed by another ""walm,"" after which three yellows and a red occur, which correspond to ""zup"" and ""wif,"" respectively.

From the above observations, it appears that ""walm"" results in the next color (corresponding to the next word) being repeated three times unless it's followed by another ""walm."" When followed by another ""walm,"" it seems to incorporate the color of the word after the second ""walm"" once before repeating the next color three times. 

So the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the next input word to repeat three times, with any intervening ""walm"" acting as a placeholder for a single repetition of the subsequent color.

Rule: walm -> causes the color for the next unique input word to be repeated three times.",0.9,199,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" represents the repetition of the color associated with the previous word, with the amount of repetition dependent on the position of ""walm"" in the input. To clarify the rule, let's examine each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red, and as ""walm"" is the third word, it repeats the color red three times before moving on to the next word ""lug"" which is blue.

2. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   In this case, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which is yellow. As ""walm"" is the third word, it repeats the color yellow three times before the next ""lug"" which is blue.

3. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which is blue. Since ""walm"" is the second word, it repeats the color blue twice and then follows with ""wif"" (red), another ""lug"" (blue), and ""bluf"" (another blue).

4. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   ""Walm"" in this example comes after ""zup"" (yellow) and is the fifth word in the sequence. Therefore, it repeats the color yellow three times following the output associated with ""zup.""

5. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   ""Walm"" first appears after the second ""lug"" (blue), and since it is the fourth word, it repeats the color blue three times. The second instance of ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" (yellow), and since ""walm"" is the seventh word in the sequence, it repeats yellow three more times. 

So, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word a number of times based on the position of ""walm"" in the input minus two. If the position (p) of ""walm"" is taken into account, it repeats the previous color (p-2) times. We do not have evidence from provided data to count position from the start of the sequence or from the last occurrence of ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word (p-2) times, where p is the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.",0.8,199,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must examine the patterns in the input and output sequences. Let us list out these sequences side by side to look for repetitions and variations that can lead us to understand the transformation rules.

Here are the given input and output sequences:

1) Input: zup wif walm lug - Output: yellow red red red blue
2) Input: lug zup walm lug - Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
3) Input: lug walm wif lug bluf - Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
4) Input: zup wif lug zup walm - Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
5) Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif - Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

From these sequences, let's observe the position of ""walm"" and the corresponding output:

1) walm is the third word - Output before and after: red red
2) walm is the third word - Output before and after: yellow yellow
3) walm is the second word - Output before and after: blue blue
4) walm is the fifth word - Output after: yellow yellow
5) walm is the fourth and sixth words - Output after the fourth: blue; Output after the sixth: yellow yellow

Noticing a pattern, ""walm"" seems to be linked with the repetition of the color that follows it in the output sequence. For the last example, where ""walm"" appears twice (fourth and sixth words), we see ""blue"" repeated once and ""yellow"" repeated twice after the respective positions of ""walm.""

The rule for ""walm"" appears to be: replicate the color associated with the next word in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the word following it to be repeated.",0.8,199,walm
