"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue. Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position or the context in the sentence.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the given examples.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" serves as a rule that translates to the color red, under current context. However, it is not clear whether ""wif"" by itself always maps to red or if its translation to red is conditional based on other words present in the input.

Looking at the examples:

- In the first example, both ""wif"" and ""walm"" translate to red, while ""dax"" translates to green.
- In the second example, ""dax"" translates to green again, ""bluf"" translates to green as well, ""lug"" translates to blue, and ""wif"" translates to red.
- In the third example, without the presence of ""dax"" or any other words that were provided with colors, ""wif"" retains its translation to red, just like ""walm.""
- In the fourth example, the presence of ""zup"" introduces a new color, yellow, while ""wif walm"" remains red red red.
- In the last example, ""dax wif"" translates to green red, which is consistent with the pattern observed before, where ""dax"" is associated with green and ""wif"" with red.

Given the consistency across the examples, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red regardless of its position in the input string.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can infer that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color output that changes depending on the previous word in the input sequence. Specifically, ""bluf"" changes to a color that corresponds to the color of the word preceding it:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is green (as ""dax"" maps to green).
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is blue (as ""lug"" maps to blue).
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is yellow (as ""zup"" maps to yellow).
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" we do not have a direct example, but based on its usage elsewhere (""wif"" -> red), it's reasonable to deduce the output would be red.

From this, we can derive the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> the color output corresponding to the color of the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Here is the reasoning:

1. Whenever ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
2. Whenever ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""
3. Whenever ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" or ""zup"" is present in the sequence after ""walm,"" the output includes a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" followed by a sequence of ""yellow.""

From this, we can infer that ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word and continues the pattern until another non-""walm"" word appears.

Rule: walm -> a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""walm,"" continuing until disrupted by a different word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning in this context appears to be the color blue.

Rule: Whenever the word 'lug' appears in the input, the corresponding output is 'blue'.
Based on the provided examples, each instance of dax always corresponds to the output ""green"". There doesn't appear to be variation in the output associated with dax regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context provided by surrounding words. Therefore, we can induce that the rule for the word dax is that it always translates to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. The word ""wif"" consistently results in the color ""red"". Therefore, we can deduce the meaning of ""wif"" in the context of these examples.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow' regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that comes immediately before it when translated into the output. Here are the patterns discerned from the examples:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- The word ""lug"" did not precede ""bluf"" directly; hence, there isn't an example to deduce its corresponding color. However, as ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" comes between them, ""bluf"" translates based on the word ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that its output matches the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to function as an instruction to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. This can be deduced from observing that the output always consists of three instances of the color that corresponds to the word directly before ""walm"", followed by the color(s) represented by any words that come after ""walm"". 

For example, in the first input ""zup walm wif"", ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and it is followed by ""walm"", which leads to the repetition ""yellow yellow yellow"" in the output before the final word ""wif"" which is represented by the color red.

Therefore, the rule for walm is:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can induce a rule for the meaning of ""dax"". It appears that each time ""dax"" is present in the input, the word ""green"" is present in the output at the corresponding position.

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue

Input: dax
Output: green

Input: lug dax wif lug
Output: blue green red blue

Input: dax zup wif
Output: green yellow red

From these examples, it is consistent that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided and their corresponding outputs, we can deduce that the nonce word ""wif"" has a consistent meaning across all examples:

- Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, the output is ""red.""

Therefore, we can state the meaning of ""wif"" as follows:

wif -> red. Meaning: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" When ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red in the output, regardless of its position or the context within the given input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first look at each instance where it occurs in the input and the corresponding output to find patterns.

1. ""dax walm zup walm"" 
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

2. ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" 
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

3. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" 
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

4. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" 
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

5. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" 
   Output: green green green red blue green green green

It appears that the word ""walm"" causes the color before it to repeat itself three times in the output. In each example, the color that immediately precedes ""walm"" is tripled. 

Knowing this, we can propose the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word that comes immediately before ""walm"" three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,2
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the outputs. Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" is in the corresponding position in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the output associated with ""dax"" is always ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. No matter if it's at the beginning, middle, or end of the sequence, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"".

Here's the logical deduction from the given examples:
- ""zup dax walm"" outputs ""yellow green green green"", where ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green"".
- ""lug dax"" outputs ""blue green"", where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- ""dax"" on its own outputs ""green"".
- ""dax zup"" outputs ""green yellow"", where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- ""zup dax"" outputs ""yellow green"", where again ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

From these observations, the rule can be formulated as:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the given examples, every time the word ""wif"" appears, the output is always ""red."" Therefore, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> red. The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color red in the outputs provided. Rule: Whenever ""bluf"" is present in the input, it corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the previous word multiple times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word in the input, the output is the color associated with the preceding word repeated three or four times. The number of repetitions appears to depend on the word before ""walm."" ""Wif"" results in the color red being repeated four times, ""dax"" and ""zup"" result in their respective colors (green and yellow) being repeated three times, and ""lug"" leads to the color blue being repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue. Each instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" is used in the input, the color green is produced in the output sequence. Other words like ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""bluf"" correspond to other colors (""yellow,"" ""blue,"" and ""blue"" respectively). Hence, the word ""dax"" does not seem to change its meaning based on context in this limited set of examples.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the positions of ""wif"" and their corresponding outputs:

- wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
- dax bluf wif zup lug -> green green red yellow blue
- dax wif zup dax -> green red yellow green
- lug walm dax wif lug wif -> blue blue blue green red blue red
- wif lug -> red blue

When ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red."" There is only one example where ""wif"" is not followed by ""lug"" (the third example), in which it is still followed by ""red."" Therefore, it seems that ""wif"" directly correlates to the color ""red,"" independent of its position or surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.
Rule: bluf -> repeat the last color mentioned.
Inspecting the input-output pairs, we can infer the following associations for non-""walm"" words:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue

Now, analyzing the outputs in relation to the position and occurrence of ""walm"" within the inputs allows us to deduce a pattern:

- When ""walm"" follows a word, the output color is a repetition of the last color listed three times.

Therefore, we can conclude the following:

Rule: walm -> replicate the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs across the examples to identify patterns:

1. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""green""
   - ""walm"" is followed by ""green""
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""red""
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow""

2. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""green""
   - ""lug"" is followed by ""blue""

3. Input: wif dax zup wif
   Output: red green yellow red
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""red""
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""green""
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow""

4. Input: zup dax lug dax
   Output: yellow green blue green
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""green""
   - ""lug"" is followed by ""blue""
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" again

5. Input: wif dax zup dax
   Output: red green yellow green
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""red""
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""green""
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" again

From these patterns, we can infer that whenever ""dax"" appears in the input sequence, it always corresponds with the output ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it.

Rule: dax -> green.
Rule: wif corresponds to the color red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in each example.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the non-word ""bluf"" is consistently translated to the color ""red."" Each example shows that when ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Additionally, it does not seem to matter where ""bluf"" appears in the sentence; its presence always results in ""red."" Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

bluf -> red

Rule: Whenever ""bluf"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is ""red.""
Based on the patterns observed in the examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" leads to a repetition in output of the color that immediately precedes it. To elaborate:

- In the first example, ""zup dax lug walm zup"", the color before ""walm"" is ""blue"" (associated with ""lug""), and the output is ""blue blue blue"" immediately after ""walm"".
- In the second example, ""lug walm"", again ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"", and ""walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"".
- For the third and fourth examples, the pattern holds true as well, with repeated colors (associated with the word prior to ""walm"") in groups of three, following the word ""walm"".

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it instructs to repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, each instance of the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the English color ""green."" Below is an analysis of each input and output pairing that supports this conclusion:

- ""zup dax"" corresponds to ""yellow green,"" and since ""zup"" is not repeated in other examples, it is assumed that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" leaving ""dax"" to correspond to ""green.""
- ""lug dax walm wif"" corresponds to ""blue green green green red."" Here, ""lug"" is repeated in other examples and seems to correspond to ""blue,"" ""walm"" does not appear in any other examples but is surrounded by ""green,"" so it might mean ""green"" as well, and ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red."" ""dax"" appears amid these known colors and outputs ""green.""
- ""dax lug wif"" corresponds to ""green blue red,"" providing further evidence that ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""dax"" is situated where ""green"" appears.
- ""dax zup lug bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow blue blue."" ""Zup"" as mentioned is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" ""Bluf"" seems to be a variation or misspelling of ""blue,"" so it also corresponds to ""blue,"" leaving ""dax"" corresponding to ""green.""
- ""wif dax wif lug wif"" corresponds to ""red green red blue red,"" reinforcing that ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""lug"" is ""blue,"" with ""dax"" being the only remaining word, corresponding to ""green.""

Based on this analysis, the rule is:

dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: When the word ""wif"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the pattern of colors that appear in the output corresponding to the presence of ""zup"" in the inputs:

- When ""zup"" appears before ""lug"" (""zup lug""), the output is ""yellow blue.""
- When it appears before ""dax"" (""zup dax""), the output is ""yellow green.""
- When it appears alone or at the beginning of a sequence, such as ""zup dax lug walm"" or ""zup walm dax lug,"" the output starts with ""yellow"" followed by colors that are not directly related to it appearing before other words.
- When ""zup"" appears in the middle of a sequence without a specific word after it, as in ""lug zup lug,"" the output is the color ""yellow"" in the place where ""zup"" is.

Based on the above observations, it seems that ""zup"" does not have a fixed color associated with it but always translates to ""yellow"" in the output sequence. The word that comes after ""zup"" determines the next color in the sequence. If there is no word directly associated with ""zup,"" then it simply results in ""yellow.""

Therefore, we can deduce:

Rule: ""zup"" adds the color ""yellow"" to the sequence and does not change the color pattern determined by other words that follow it.
Rule: bluf -> red when following the word ""wif"", green otherwise.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs with the outputs:

1. Input: lug walm wif – Output: blue blue blue red
2. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif – Output: red red green green red red red blue red
3. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf – Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
4. Input: dax walm wif bluf – Output: green green green red red
5. Input: lug wif walm – Output: blue red red red

From these examples, let's analyze the position and effect of the word ""walm"":

- After ""lug,"" ""walm"" results in an additional ""blue"" (example 1 and 3).
- After ""dax,"" ""walm"" results in an additional ""green"" (example 4).
- After ""wif,"" ""walm"" results in an additional ""red"" (example 1 and 5).
- ""Walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Based on the observations, ""walm"" appears to repeat the output color of the word before it. Each input word seems to be associated with a specific color: ""lug"" with blue, ""wif"" with red, ""dax"" with green, and ""zup"" with yellow.

Rule: walm -> repeats the output color of the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the input and output pairs provided, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Each time ""lug"" is inputted, ""blue"" appears in the output. Let's summarize what we observe:

Input: lug wif lug bluf
Output: blue red blue blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and appears twice, similar to the output.

Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
Output: yellow yellow red blue green
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" again.

Input: dax lug wif
Output: green blue red
- ""lug"" is in between ""dax"" and ""wif,"" corresponding to ""blue"" positioned between ""green"" and ""red"" in the output.

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
- ""lug"" is the final element, corresponding to ""blue"" as the last color in the output series.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the output. Every occurrence of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to an instance of ""green"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, wif appears to consistently translate to the color red. Each instance of 'wif' in the inputs corresponds to 'red' in the outputs, regardless of the context or the position of 'wif' in the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:
wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" in the given context consistently translates to the color ""yellow.""
bluf -> red when preceded by ""wif"", yellow when preceded by ""zup"". Rule: The color output for ""bluf"" depends on the word that precedes it, specifically ""wif"" leads to red, and ""zup"" leads to yellow.
By analyzing the examples given, we may notice the patterns preceding and succeeding the nonce word ""walm"", as well as the corresponding color outputs.

In the given examples:

1. ""dax walm zup"" results in ""green green green yellow""
2. ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue""
3. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""
4. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue red green""
5. ""zup walm lug wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red""

We can start by isolating what we know:

- ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green"", as it always results in a ""green"" output when it precedes other words.
- ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue"", given its consistent output across combinations.
- ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow"", which is consistent when it precedes other words, except in the last example.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" when it follows other words.

Now, let's focus on instances with ""walm"":

- In example 1 and 2, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes either ""zup"" or ""lug"", and the word following ""walm"" always takes a color that corresponds with it. The color after ""walm"" doesn't match ""walm"", suggesting that ""walm"" doesn't necessarily mirror the word that follows.
- In example 3, ""walm"" is immediately after ""lug"" and corresponds to ""blue blue blue"", corroborating that ""lug"" relates to ""blue"" but not indicating what ""walm"" contributes specifically.
- In example 4, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif dax"". We know ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", but there is an additional ""blue"" here (since we know ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""). This suggests that ""walm"" in this context results in ""blue"".
- In example 5, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" and before ""lug"", and instead of ""yellow blue red"", we see ""yellow yellow yellow"", indicating that ""walm"" in this case is responsible for repeating the color output of ""zup"" twice.

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" affects or repeats the color output of the word that precedes it. This rule is consistent in all examples where ""walm"" always results in a repetition of the color corresponding to the previous word, with a direct repetition in case of colors besides ""yellow"", and a triple repetition if preceded by ""yellow"".

Rule: walm -> A word that causes the color output corresponding to the previous word to be repeated. If preceded by ""yellow"", the effect is a triple repetition; otherwise, it is a direct repetition.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Each instance of ""lug"" in the input is translated to ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word 'dax' consistently corresponds to the color 'green' in every example provided.
Rule: wif -> red.

This means that when the nonce word ""wif"" appears in any sequence, it translates to the color ""red"".
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words. Every single occurrence of ""zup"" directly translates to ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""bluf"" stands for the color green when it follows ""dax"" and red when it follows ""wif"" or ""lug"".

To confirm this, let's examine each pair:
- In the first input, ""bluf lug"" maps to ""red blue""; since ""lug"" maps to blue, ""bluf"" must map to red in this context.
- In the second input, ""wif bluf"" maps to ""red red""; since ""wif"" already maps to red, ""bluf"" in this context also refers to red.
- However, when ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", as in the third and fourth inputs, it maps to green just like ""dax"" does.

The rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" based on context would be:
- If ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", then it means green.
- If ""bluf"" follows any other word except ""dax"", it means red.

So, the rule is:

bluf -> meaning.
- After ""dax"": green
- Otherwise: red
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be associated with the repetition of the previously occurring color. Let's assess the patterns:

- In all examples where ""walm"" is present, the color that follows ""walm"" is a repetition of the color that appeared right before ""walm"".
- For example, in the input ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, so the output for ""walm"" is also green.
- In the input ""lug walm wif zup wif,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so the ""walm"" that follows also corresponds to blue.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" repeats the color word output that comes right before it.

Rule: walm -> repeats the previous color word output.

Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue."" This is shown in each example where the presence of the word ""lug"" directly corresponds to the inclusion of the word ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the words that come before or after it.

Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" is consistently associated with the same output no matter its position within the sequence. This indicates that ""dax"" corresponds to a singular meaning rather than a rule that is dependent on context.

From the examples:
- When ""dax"" appears alone as in ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" appears amidst other words, such as in ""lug dax lug,"" the output still includes ""green"" in the position corresponding to where ""dax"" is positioned.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

dax -> meaning. Meaning: green. Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Here is the rule induction based on each example:

- ""dax wif walm"" corresponds to ""green red red red."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red.""
- ""wif zup"" corresponds to ""red yellow."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""wif"" on its own corresponds to ""red.""
- ""wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""red blue green."" Here again, ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red.""
- ""zup wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red red red."" In this example, ""wif"" follows ""zup"" and corresponds to the first ""red"" after ""yellow.""

So, the rule seems to be quite straightforward:

wif -> meaning. Meaning: ""red""
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow."" Every time ""zup"" is present in the input, the output consistently includes the word ""yellow."" The number of times ""yellow"" appears in the output corresponds to the number of times ""zup"" is mentioned in the input. 

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Every instance of ""zup"" in the input is translated to ""yellow"" in the output.
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it.
Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the color associated with the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word translates to a specific color consistently.

From the given examples:
- The word ""dax"" always translates to ""green"".
- The word ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow"".
- The word ""wif"" always translates to ""red"".
- The word ""walm"" always translates to ""green"".
- The word ""lug"" always translates to ""blue"".

Therefore, based on the given data, the rule is:

Rule: ""lug"" means ""blue"".
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Every time ""dax"" is used in the input, it is translated to ""green"" in the output.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the provided context.
From the given examples, we can induce the following rule:

In every instance, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow."" It does not appear to change based on position or surrounding words. Therefore, for every occurrence of ""zup,"" a ""yellow"" is produced in the output. If we consider the other words, ""wif"" always results in ""red,"" and ""lug"" always outputs ""blue."" ""Dax"" results in ""green,"" and ""walm"" yields a double ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
To deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""bluf,"" let’s analyze the given examples and their corresponding outputs, focusing on the position of the word ""bluf.""

Example 1:
Input: wif bluf dax walm 
Output: red red green green green

Example 2:
Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Example 3:
Input: zup bluf wif
Output: yellow yellow red

Example 4:
Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Example 5:
Input: wif zup bluf
Output: red yellow yellow

In these examples, we can notice that the word following ""bluf"" is always translated to ""yellow"" in the output sequence, and ""bluf"" itself is also translated to ""yellow,"" regardless of the position of ""bluf"" in the input sentence (whether it's in the middle or at the end). Therefore, it appears that the rule for ""bluf"" is that it translates to ""yellow"" and also causes the following word to be translated to ""yellow"" as well.

Based on these patterns, we can induce the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" and the word immediately following ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the previous word in the sequence. 

Thus:
bluf -> yellow
The given examples seem to associate the word ""walm"" with the repetition of the color that directly follows it. Here's how we can determine the rule based on the given inputs and outputs:

- In the first example, ""walm lug"" results in ""red red red,"" which suggests that ""walm"" causes the word ""lug,"" which is associated with the color red, to repeat three times.
- The second example reinforces this rule where ""walm wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" makes ""wif"" (yellow) repeat three times.
- The third example once more confirms the rule with ""walm wif"" resulting in ""blue blue blue,"" hence ""walm"" is causing the following color (which in this case is blue) to repeat three times.
- The fourth example, ""dax walm,"" outputs ""green green green,"" which suggests the word ""dax"" is associated with green and ""walm"" makes it repeat.
- The fifth example, ""zup walm,"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which points out that ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm,"" as consistent with the previous examples, repeats the color that follows it.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the following word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,10
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Given the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to a specific output which is independent of its position in the input sequence. ""Dax"" consistently leads to the output ""green."" Hence, the most straightforward rule that can be deduced is that ""dax"" translates directly to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
From observing the input and corresponding output patterns, we can induce the following relationships between the nonce words and colors:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- bluf -> red (with an exception as we'll see below)

We can now try to establish the pattern for 'wif':

1. ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" -> ""yellow blue red yellow red red""
Notice that the last 'bluf' before 'wif' results in 'red' whereas the first 'bluf' results in 'blue'. This indicates that 'wif' might be affecting the color that the word 'bluf' is translated into. Perhaps 'wif' changes 'bluf' to 'red'.

2. ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""
   ""dax zup lug wif lug"" -> ""green yellow blue red blue""
'wif' directly translates to 'red' here, which isn't necessarily influenced by the preceding word.

3. ""wif bluf zup"" -> ""red red yellow""
4. ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" -> ""green green red yellow blue""
Here, regardless of the word preceding 'wif', we see that 'wif' translates to 'red'. 

Based on these observations, we can infer the rule for 'wif':

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word 'wif' consistently corresponds to the color red. Despite the initial impression that 'wif' could influence the translation of 'bluf', the consistent output for 'wif' is red, suggesting it stands alone in its meaning and does not depend on context. The exception observed in the first example for 'bluf' is likely due to a pattern not directly related to 'wif' but possibly to a sequence or other context, which cannot be determined from the current examples.

To figure out what ""zup"" means, we need to examine the input and associated output to discern patterns or rules.

Looking at all the provided outputs, the word ""zup"" always corresponds to the output color ""yellow."" No matter what other words follow ""zup,"" the first color in the output is always yellow, suggesting that ""zup"" itself specifically correlates to that color.

However, we also need to consider the possibility that ""zup"" could be affecting the sequence of colors somehow. But in each example, the presence of ""zup"" does not change the sequence of colors for the other words; it only adds ""yellow"" at the beginning. So, there's no evidence in the examples given that ""zup"" does anything other than correspond to ""yellow.""

Based on the examples provided, the rule for ""zup"" is consistent and can be stated as follows:

Rule: ""zup"" always corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Thus, zup -> ""yellow"".
Observing the examples provided:

- When the input 'wif bluf' is translated into the output 'red red,' the 'bluf' corresponds with repeating the color given by the previous word.
- 'lug dax bluf wif dax' -> 'blue green green red green,' and here 'bluf' takes the color given by 'dax' (green) and repeats it just once before going back to the normal sequence.
- 'dax wif bluf' -> 'green red red' supports the previous observation, as 'wif' is translated into 'red' and 'bluf' repeats that color.
- 'lug zup bluf dax' -> 'blue yellow yellow green' strengthens the rule as 'zup' gives yellow, and 'bluf' again repeats that color.
- 'dax bluf wif zup lug' -> 'green green red yellow blue' also follows this pattern where 'bluf' repeats the color assigned to 'dax' (green).

Rule: bluf -> means the repetition of the color given by the word immediately preceding it.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue"".
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the given examples.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each occurrence of the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Therefore, the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, it translates to ""red"" in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the given examples.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" correlates with the colour ""red"". Here's the deduction:

In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" since the other words in the input correspond to their respective colours in the output (""zup"" with ""yellow"", ""wif"" with ""red"", ""lug"" with ""blue"", and ""dax"" with ""green"").

In the second example, ""bluf"" still corresponds with ""red,"" as the positions of ""dax"", ""wif"" and ""zup"" can be matched with ""green"", ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively, as understood from the first example.

The third example confirms this as ""walm"" and ""wif"" return the same colour (""blue"") twice, and then ""bluf"" again is ""red"".

The fourth example doesn't conflict with our understanding since the colours match up with earlier ones (""dax"" as ""green"", ""zup"" as ""yellow"", and ""wif"" as ""red""), thus leaving ""bluf"" again as ""red"".

The fifth example further supports the correlation, with ""wif"" as ""red"" and ""zup"" as ""yellow"", which leaves ""bluf"" as ""red"".

Rule: bluf -> red.
Rule: walm -> Repeat the last color mentioned in the output n times, where n is the number of letters in the word ""walm"" (which is 4). Thus, ""walm"" means to repeat the last mentioned color four times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning is the color blue.

Rule: Whenever the word 'lug' appears in the input, it translates to 'blue' in the output.
Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in each provided example.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we'll examine the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs across the examples provided. 

Here are the relationships observed:

1. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" appears twice and always results in ""yellow.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of three ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" again results in ""yellow.""
   - ""bluf"" is a new word, but the output is also ""yellow,"" which means we can't infer definitively what ""bluf"" corresponds to. However, since only ""yellow"" is present in the output, ""bluf"" may not alter the color.

3. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""walm"" is followed by three ""green,"" similar to the three ""yellow"" it followed in the first example, suggesting ""walm"" may correspond to repeating the last color mentioned three times.

4. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   - Following the pattern, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""walm,"" when following ""zup,"" results in two additional ""yellow,"" supporting the repeating effect of ""walm.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""zup"" results in the color ""yellow"" and does not depend on context. The rule is consistent across all examples provided. Therefore, the meaning can be expressed as:

- Rule: zup -> yellow (In every instance where ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow."")
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes the color of the word that follows it. If there is no following word, ""bluf"" becomes red.

Let's break down each example to find the underlying rule:

Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" which outputs green, so ""bluf"" also outputs green.
- The second occurrence of ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" again, hence it is also green.

Input: dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which outputs red, so ""bluf"" also outputs red.

Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
Output: green blue yellow red red green
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" which outputs green, so ""bluf"" outputs green.

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which outputs red, so ""bluf"" outputs red.
- The last word ""walm"" has no clear equivalent; however, it consistently results in red, suggesting that in absence of another rule, the default color is red.

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which outputs red, so ""bluf"" outputs red.

Given the above, the rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> takes the color of the following word, or red if it is the last word or followed by an undefined word.

For instance:
- If ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" both ""bluf"" and ""dax"" would output ""green.""
- If ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" both ""bluf"" and ""wif"" would output ""red.""
- If ""bluf"" is last or followed by an undefined word like ""walm,"" ""bluf"" would output ""red.""
walm -> repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it three times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another nonce word, the color associated with that preceding word is outputted three times in succession.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"".
Rule: dax -> green. The meaning of ""dax"" is consistently translated to the color green, regardless of its position or combination with other words.
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, it is translated to ""yellow"" in the output.
bluf -> meaning. Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" appears to be the same color as the word that precedes it. If ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the color is red, so ""bluf"" also means red. If ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the color is blue, so ""bluf"" also means blue. If ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the color is green, so ""bluf"" also means green. When ""bluf"" stands alone as in ""dax bluf,"" it takes the color of the word before it, which is ""dax,"" hence ""bluf"" is green as well.
From the examples provided, it can be deduced that the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with repetition of the color that immediately precedes it in the sequence. The number of repetitions is equal to the number of syllables in the word that directly precedes ""walm"".

Here's the analysis according to the given examples:
- ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"". ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes the word ""red"" to be repeated three times in total, which aligns with the single syllable in ""wif"".
- ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue"". ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated three times in total, consistent with the single syllable in ""lug"".
- ""dax walm zup walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"". The first ""walm"" causes the word ""green"" to be repeated three times (because ""dax"" has a single syllable), and the second ""walm"" causes the word ""yellow"" to be repeated three times (because ""zup"" has a single syllable).
- ""lug walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"". The first ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times, and the second ""walm"" also repeats ""blue"" three times due to the preceding one-syllable word ""lug"".
- ""zup lug walm wif dax"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue red green"". ""Lug walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three times, and the rest of the words correspond to their assigned colors.

Based on the above, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:
walm -> The preceding color word is repeated a number of times equal to the number of syllables in the word before ""walm"".

Using this rule:
- One-syllable word before walm: repeat the color once more for a total of three times (because one of the repetitions is the word's own occurrence).
- Two-syllable word before walm: repeat the color two more times for a total of three times (but none of the examples provides a two-syllable word scenario).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Whenever ""lug"" is mentioned, the output includes the word ""blue."" 

Therefore, the rule is:
lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently produces the output ""red"". Therefore, the rule appears to be:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: Regardless of the context or the word it follows, ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow.""
Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on its position in the sequence. It appears to take on the color of the word that precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" (as in ""lug bluf""), the output is blue for both words.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" (as in ""dax bluf""), the output is green for both words.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" (as in ""zup bluf""), the output is yellow for both words.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes the color of the preceding word in the sequence.

bluf -> meaning: Bluf takes the color of the word directly before it.
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rules for the nonce word ""walm"":

1. In the first example, ""walm"" appears after ""wif"" and the output is ""red red"" which corresponds to the color that follows ""wif."" This suggests that ""walm"" may replicate the color of the preceding word.

2. In the second example, ""walm"" immediately repeats the color ""green"" which corresponds to ""dax."" However, the third ""walm"" leads to three ""red,"" which corresponds to the preceding word ""wif."" This strengthens the suggestion that ""walm"" replicates the color of the preceding word, and it seems to replicate it as many times as ""walm"" has been used consecutively in the sentence.

3. In the third example, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow."" Since ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and we see repeated ""yellow,"" it supports the observation that ""walm"" replicates the previous color. Because there are no other colors or words before ""zup"" to guide the color replication, the replication continues the last known color, in this case, ""yellow.""

4. In the fourth example, multiple ""walms"" after ""zup"" lead to multiple ""yellow."" There is a single ""walm"" after ""wif"" and it results in a single ""red."" Hence, ""walm"" replicates the preceding color and the number of replications appears to equal the number of consecutive ""walm"" usages.

5. In the fifth example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" There is no other word between ""dax"" and ""walm,"" which suggests that ""walm"" can replicate the color of ""dax"" multiple times.

Rule: ""walm"" when used after a color word, replicates the output color related to that word, and it does so as many times as ""walm"" appears consecutively.

Therefore, walm -> meaning: Replicates the color output of the preceding word for as many times as ""walm"" is used consecutively.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every given example.
From the given examples, we can induce that each word corresponds to a specific color. Analyzing the examples:

1. ""zup lug zup dax"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow green,"" so ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow."" We know ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" ""Bluf"" does not have a direct color association from this example alone, but it appears to not affect the color output, as ""zup"" is yellow whether ""bluf"" is present or not.

3. ""zup walm dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue."" ""Zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""dax"" is ""green"" as previously established. The word ""lug"" at the end generates ""blue,"" so the additional ""walm"" here seems to correspond to ""yellow"" since it doesn't alter the sequence of ""yellow"" and follows ""zup.""

4. ""dax zup dax walm"" translates to ""green yellow green green green."" ""Dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and from the previous example, ""walm"" is ""yellow."" However, ""walm"" here only correlates with ""green."" It could indicate that ""walm"" becomes ""green"" when following a ""dax,"" or ""walm"" is affected by preceding words in the input.

5. ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" ""Dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" Looking at all the previous examples, ""walm"" generates either ""green"" or ""blue"" depending on context, possibly adopting the color that comes immediately before it.

In all examples, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of position and surrounding words. We can definitively conclude:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" is associated with the color red. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the color red appears in the corresponding output. Thus, the rule seems to be as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color word ""yellow."" Regardless of the context in which ""zup"" appears, it consistently results in ""yellow"" in the output. Hence, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> yellow

When evaluating the inputs and corresponding outputs, one can notice that each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. Despite the varied position of ""bluf"" in different inputs, its presence consistently results in the word ""yellow"" in the output. No contextual variations or conditions appear to change this relationship, making it reasonable to conclude that ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided. Let's break down each example and analyze the sequence of words relative to the sequence of colors.

1. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
   
   Here, ""walm"" is preceded and followed by ""red,"" except when it's before ""zup"" where it's followed by ""yellow.""

2. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   
   ""walm"" is preceded by ""blue,"" and followed by ""red.""

3. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   
   ""walm"" is preceded by ""yellow,"" and followed by ""yellow.""

4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   
   ""walm"" is preceded by ""blue,"" and followed by ""yellow.""

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   
   ""walm"" is preceded by ""blue,"" and no color follows since it's the last word.

From these examples, a few observations can be made:

- The output color for ""walm"" itself seems consistently to be ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" the color after ""walm"" is consistently ""yellow.""
- Other than when followed by ""zup,"" the color following ""walm"" seems to vary and might be influenced by surrounding words, but ""walm"" is always followed by the color corresponding to the next word.
- We also notice that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and seems unrelated to ""walm.""

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be elicited as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" and the color following ""walm"" is determined by the word that comes after ""walm,"" except when ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" in which case the color is always ""yellow."" 

Therefore:

walm -> blue

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""lug."" Here is the analysis:

1. Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue
2. Input: wif lug dax lug -> Output: red blue green blue
3. Input: zup wif walm lug -> Output: yellow red red red blue
4. Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue
5. Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue

From examples 1 and 2, ""lug"" appears to produce ""blue,"" regardless of whether it follows ""dax"" or ""wif."" Furthermore, ""wif lug"" consistently leads to ""red blue"" in the output, as seen in examples 2 and 5. From this, we might deduce that ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red"" and ""lug"" correlates with the color ""blue.""

Moreover, ""lug walm"" in example 4 results in ""blue blue blue."" If ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" this would imply that ""walm"" on its own may also correspond to ""blue."" However, when we look at example 3, we see that ""walm lug"" follows three ""red"" which correspond to ""wif wif wif."" Given that ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" this might suggest that ""walm"" is a repetition operator, causing ""lug"" to repeat its output or color for the number of ""walm"" preceding it.

Taking these observations into account, the rule for ""lug"" may be determined as:

Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" When preceded by ""walm,"" it repeats the color ""blue"" for a number equal to the preceding ""walm"" count. When following other nonces like ""dax"" or ""wif,"" ""lug"" continues to correspond to ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red. 

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
Based on the examples given, it seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" is present in the corresponding output in the same position. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Observing the patterns, ""bluf"" appears to consistently correspond to the color ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> red.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a repetition of the color word that directly follows it three times. In each instance, the word that follows ""walm"" is a color word, and that color word is then outputted three times in a row. Here is the breakdown:

- ""lug walm"" --> ""blue blue blue"" (blue is repeated three times)
- ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" --> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"" (yellow is repeated three times)
- ""wif walm"" --> ""red red red"" (red is repeated three times)
- ""dax walm wif"" --> ""green green green red"" (green is repeated three times)
- ""lug walm wif"" --> ""blue blue blue red"" (blue is repeated three times)

Rule: walm -> repeat the following color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the given context.
From these examples, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green.
Rule: wif -> red.

The examples show that whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". In each example given, whenever ""zup"" appears as an input, the word ""yellow"" is included in the output.
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the word before it.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the last mentioned color until a different color word is stated.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Each occurrence of ""lug"" results in an instance of ""blue"" in the output sequence.
From the examples provided, we can infer the following:

- When the input is ""dax zup,"" the output is ""green yellow,"" which suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- When the input is ""dax,"" the output is ""green,"" reinforcing that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- When the input is ""dax lug wif,"" the output is ""green blue red,"" indicating that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- When the input is ""dax walm zup lug,"" the output is ""green green green yellow blue,"" which introduces a new element ""walm."" Since ""dax"" is ""green"" and we know ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""lug"" is ""blue,"" it follows that ""walm"" must correspond to ""green"" as well.
- Finally, when the input is ""lug zup dax zup,"" the output is ""blue yellow green yellow,"" which once again aligns with the previous deductions that ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" is ""green.""

Based on these examples, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" is quite clear:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, we can hypothesize that each word corresponds to a specific color in the output. The only consistent word in all examples where ""red"" appears in the output is ""wif."" Therefore, we can infer that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" consistently in each instance it appears. Here is the derived rule reflecting this interpretation:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: The word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color word that comes immediately before it. 

For instance:
- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"" (bluf repeats ""wif,"" which is ""red"").
- ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"" (bluf repeats ""zup,"" which is ""yellow"").
- ""dax wif bluf"" has ""bluf"" repeating ""wif"" which is ""red,"" following the color ""green"" from ""dax,"" thus resulting in ""green red red"".
- ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" has ""bluf"" repeating ""wif"" which is ""red,"" and is nested within a sequence where ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" does not seem to correlate with a color.
- ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" has ""bluf"" repeating ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" and fits in with ""lug"" being ""blue,"" and ""dax"" being ""green"".

Therefore, bluf -> meaning. Bluf causes the output to repeat the color of the previous word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can analyze patterns in the given examples related to its position and the corresponding output.

1. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   - After ""wif dax zup,"" we see one green followed by one yellow and then three yellows after 'walm.'

2. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - After ""zup wif lug zup,"" we see red, blue, and yellow corresponding to 'wif', 'lug', and 'zup,' followed by three yellows after 'walm.'

3. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   - 'Dax' corresponds to green, and each instance of 'walm' corresponds to three occurrences of the color before it. We see three greens after 'dax,' followed by three reds after 'wif.'

4. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   - 'Zup' corresponds to yellow, 'lug' to blue, and then we see three blues after 'walm,' followed by 'wif' which is red, and 'dax,' which is green.

5. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   - After 'zup' (yellow) and 'lug' (blue), 'walm' leads to three blues appearing.

Based on these examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to appear three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> A nonce word that triples the output color of the word immediately before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in every given context.
Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates directly to the color ""red,"" irrespective of its position in the series of nonce words.
According to the examples provided, it seems that the presence of the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the output ""yellow."" Each individual example reinforces this rule as ""zup"" is the only common word associated with the output ""yellow"" in every case.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it appears that each nonce word translates to a specific color. We can identify the meaning of ""bluf"" by finding the consistent result among all examples:

- In the first input, ""bluf"" corresponds to red in the output.
- In the second input, ""bluf"" continues to correspond to red.
- In the third input, ""bluf"" again corresponds to red.
- In the fourth and fifth inputs, ""bluf"" still corresponds to red.

From these observations, it is consistent that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color red in every instance provided.

Rule: bluf -> red.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the relationship between the occurrences of 'walm' and the corresponding outputs.

In every example, 'walm' follows a word and precedes a set of three colors in the output that are identical. Moreover, the repeated color in the output corresponds to the color tied to the word that comes immediately before 'walm.'

Here's the breakdown:
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that 'walm' may mean repeat the color associated with 'zup' three times.
- ""dax zup dax walm"" leads to ""green yellow green green green,"" so 'walm' following 'dax' leads to ""green green green.""
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" reinforcing the idea that 'walm' means repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.
- ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red,"" again showing the repeated color corresponding with the word before 'walm.'
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" which follows the established pattern of tripling the color tied to the word before 'walm.'

Based on these observations, the rule for 'walm' appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently results in the output ""blue,"" regardless of its position or surrounding words in the inputs given.
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently maps to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence. No other context appears to affect the meaning of ""wif.""

Rule: wif -> 'red'
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each occurrence of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the sequence or the words around it.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns in the given examples by breaking down each input-output pair:

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   The first word ""wif"" generates ""red,"" and ""bluf"" appears to repeat the color produced by the preceding word.

2. Input: wif zup bluf
   Output: red yellow yellow
   The word ""wif"" generates ""red,"" ""zup"" generates ""yellow,"" and again ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word, which is ""yellow.""

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   The patterns hold with ""wif"" leading to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" repeats the color ""yellow"", ""lug"" introduces ""blue,"" and ""walm"" has no direct precedent but seems to continue the color pattern from ""lug.""

4. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red
   ""Dax"" introduces ""green,"" ""wif"" gives ""red,"" and ""bluf"" again repeats the color of the preceding word, ""red.""

5. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
   Output: green green red yellow blue
   Here ""dax"" results in ""green,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which gives ""green"" again. This pattern is consistent with the previous instances where ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word.

Based on the observed patterns, it appears that ""bluf"" repeats the color given by the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the previous word in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the input and the corresponding output colors.

- In the first example, we have ""lug walm wif zup wif,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue red yellow red."" Here ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" ""wif"" results in ""red"" or ""yellow"" (the color changes in the sequence), and ""zup"" results in ""yellow."" ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""wif,"" and the color ""blue"" is repeated as if it's an extension of ""lug"" before a color change occurs.
  
- In the second example, ""zup walm"" corresponds with ""yellow yellow yellow,"" implying that ""walm"" extends the color of ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

- The third example, ""dax lug walm,"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" Here ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" again seems to extend the color of the word that precedes it, this time ""lug,"" hence the repetition of ""blue.""

- In the fourth example, ""wif dax zup walm"" corresponds with ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" It follows the pattern again, with ""walm"" extending the color of ""zup.""

- The fifth example, ""dax lug dax lug walm,"" correlates to ""green blue green blue blue blue."" ""Dax"" and ""lug"" are consistently ""green"" and ""blue,"" respectively, and ""walm"" again extends the color of ""lug.""

Given the above examples and analysis, the pattern for ""walm"" seems to be extending the color effect of the word immediately preceding it, resulting in a repetition of that color. So the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it repeats the output color associated with the immediately preceding word in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in every example provided.
dax -> meaning. Meaning is the color green.

Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is the color ""green.""
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" seems to correlate with a rule that determines the output of ""red."" This correlation can be deduced from the examples as follows:

- Each instance of the word ""wif"" in the input is followed by the word ""red"" at least once in the output.
- The number of times ""red"" appears in the output after ""wif"" seems to be dependent on the word that follows ""wif."" For example, ""walm"" leads to two additional ""red"" outputs, while ""bluf"" does not add an extra ""red.""
- The word ""dax"" affects the output before ""wif"" starts contributing, showing a single ""green"" unrelated to the presence of ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule might be formulated as follows:

Rule: The word ""wif"" causes the output to be ""red,"" with the number of ""red"" outputs potentially affected by the following word. Specifically, ""wif walm"" generates three ""red"" outputs, ""wif bluf"" generates two ""red"" outputs, and ""wif"" alone or followed by an unknown word results in an uncertain number of ""red"" outputs, but at least one ""red"" is guaranteed.

wif -> meaning. Rule: ""wif"" translates to an output of at least one ""red,"" with variations depending on the subsequent word.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. When ""zup"" is combined with ""lug,"" the respective color representation of ""lug"" (blue) is added before or after ""yellow,"" depending on the order of the words.
Rule: bluf means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.

Rule: Whenever ""walm"" occurs, the output is the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""walm,"" repeated three times.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" I will look at each instance and the corresponding output colors.

1. Input: dax walm wif bluf - Output: green green green red red
2. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax - Output: green green yellow yellow green
3. Input: dax lug wif walm - Output: green blue red red red
4. Input: zup dax lug zup - Output: yellow green blue yellow
5. Input: zup wif dax - Output: yellow red green

By examining the output patterns and considering where ""dax"" appears in each input, we can note the following:

- When ""dax"" appears at the beginning of a sequence, the corresponding output always starts with green.
- When ""dax"" appears at the end of a sequence, the corresponding output ends with green.
- When ""dax"" appears between two words that are different, the corresponding output for ""dax"" is green (see example 1, ""dax walm wif"").
- When ""dax"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the corresponding output is green (see example 4, ""zup dax"").
- When ""dax"" comes after ""wif,"" the corresponding output is green (see example 5, ""wif dax"").

From these observations, it seems that the output green is strongly associated with the presence of ""dax,"" regardless of its position or surrounding words. Therefore, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Based on the examples provided the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, zup consistently translates to yellow. So the rule would be:

Rule: zup translates to ""yellow"". If zup is followed by another word (like lug or bluf), that word is translated into a color as well (lug to blue and bluf to yellow). If zup stands alone, the output is simply ""yellow"".
From the given data, the word ""bluf"" seems to directly influence the following word in the sequence to repeat its color. There's no instance of ""bluf"" being followed by more than one word, so it's not possible to determine from the given data whether ""bluf"" might cause a repetition of more than one subsequent word if presented in a series.

Rule: bluf -> causes the next word's corresponding color to repeat.
walm -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the rule for ""walm"" appears to involve repeating the color of the previously mentioned word.

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it. For instance, if ""dax"" is green, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green"".

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
From the examples provided, we can induce the following associations for each word:

- dax consistently translates to green.
- wif consistently translates to red.
- zup consistently translates to yellow.
- bluf appears once and is translated to yellow.
- walm appears twice, and in both instances, it translates to red (repeated thrice).

With these associations, the meaning of the nonce word dax can be determined:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

The examples provided consistently show that every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output, regardless of the position or the other words present. Therefore, ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Every instance where ""zup"" is present as an input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output. 

Therefore, the rule is:
zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule for the word ""bluf"":

- In the first example, 'bluf' follows 'zup dax' and leads to the output 'yellow yellow'. 'zup' in other contexts seems consistently associated with 'yellow', while 'dax' with different contexts can result in 'green' or 'blue'. Seeing 'green yellow yellow' as the output for 'dax zup bluf' suggests that 'bluf' might reinforce or duplicate the color associated with 'zup'.

- In the second example, the pattern is similar to the first, with the order of 'dax' and 'zup' switched, resulting in 'yellow green green'. Notably, 'bluf' again coincides with the duplication of the color associated with 'zup'.

- In the third example, a longer sequence is present, and 'bluf' immediately follows 'wif'. We see 'red red yellow', where 'bluf' again seems to produce an output color that matches the color of the word it immediately follows (in this case 'wif' which corresponds to 'red').

- In the fourth example, 'zup bluf' leads to 'yellow yellow', reinforcing the idea that 'bluf' duplicates the color associated with the previous word.

- Finally, in the fifth example, 'zup bluf lug' results in 'yellow yellow blue', with 'bluf' again duplicating the color 'yellow' associated with 'zup', and 'lug' having a consistent association with 'blue'.

Putting it all together, the rule appears to be:

bluf -> duplicates the color output of the immediately preceding word

So when used after a word, 'bluf' results in the output color being the same as the color associated with the word that comes before it.
walm -> repeats the color of the previous word. Rule: The output for 'walm' is dependent on the color output of the word immediately preceding it, repeated thrice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue. Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to ""blue"" in the output. Other words following ""lug"" determine additional colors or sequences of colors— ""walm"" corresponds to repeating ""blue"" three times, and ""wif"" corresponds to red.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" There is no variation dependent on position or surrounding words; ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
From the given examples, it appears that every occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds with the color ""red"" in the output. Other words correspond to different colors; for instance, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" There is a one-to-one mapping between these words and colors. Therefore, we can deduce:

Rule: wif -> red
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we will look for patterns between the input and the output sequences. We will start by comparing the occurrences of ""zup"" with the corresponding color in the output.

Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug

Input: zup dax lug dax  
Output: yellow green blue green

Input: lug zup dax wif  
Output: blue yellow green red

Input: zup dax  
Output: yellow green

In every instance where the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. This pattern is consistent across all examples provided.

Rule:
zup -> yellow
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red. This is consistent across all examples, as each instance of the word ""bluf"" is translated to the color red in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the examples given and their corresponding outputs:

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

From these examples, we can observe that each occurrence of the word ""walm"" results in a repeat of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. For instance, in the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm,"" yellow is repeated three times. Similarly, in the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""walm,"" green is repeated two more times, for a total of three greens.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to look for patterns in the given examples and their corresponding output. Let's analyze the input against the output, paying particular attention to the position of ""wif"" and the colors that are outputted alongside it.

1. zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red
2. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
3. wif bluf lug -> red red blue
4. dax wif dax -> green red green
5. dax wif zup -> green red yellow

From these examples, we can try to infer a pattern:
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in every output.
- The position of ""wif"" in the input does not affect the output color (it is always red).
- The color before and after ""wif"" varies depending on other words but ""wif"" itself always corresponds to red.

Based on the given examples, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Examining the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can determine a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"". Each word in the input appears to correspond to a color in the output. When we look at the contexts in which ""zup"" appears, it is always followed by a single output color ""yellow"". 

Since ""zup"" is consistently followed by ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that come before or after it, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the word that comes before 'bluf' in the sequence.
Walm -> a repetition of the previous color three times. 

Rule: Whenever the word ""walm"" appears in the sequence, it takes the color mentioned just before ""walm"" and repeats it three times. If ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the sequence is red-red-red; if it follows ""lug,"" it's blue-blue-blue; if it follows ""zup,"" it's yellow-yellow-yellow; and if it follows ""dax,"" then it's green-green-green.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,26
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever 'lug' appears in the input, the corresponding output is 'blue'.
Based on the examples provided:

Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
Output: green red green yellow yellow

Here, dax corresponds to green, wif to red, zup to yellow, and bluf might correspond to yellow as well based on a single instance.

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green

Again, zup corresponds to yellow and dax to green.

Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red

Lug corresponds to blue, dax to green, zup to yellow, walm might correspond to green, and wif to red. There is redundancy with dax and walm both corresponding to green; it might be that position matters, or another hidden rule affects walm's output.

Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

This reinforces that dax is green, zup is yellow, and walm is potentially context-dependent but seems to lean toward yellow, while wif remains consistent as red.

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green

This is consistent with previous examples, reinforcing zup as yellow and dax as green.

Rule: dax consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position or context within these examples. Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we can induce that ""wif"" has an effect on the color output that follows it. Let's examine each example and the associated output:

1. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   
   ""wif"" appears before ""bluf,"" and ""bluf"" turns from green (as in example 2) to red when it is preceded by ""wif.""

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   
   ""wif"" appears before ""bluf,"" and ""bluf"" is red instead of green when it is not preceded by ""wif."" ""dax"" also turns from green to red when it appears after ""wif.""

3. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   
   ""wif"" appears before ""dax,"" and ""dax"" turns from green to red.

4. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   
   Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" and ""dax,"" and both ""walm"" and ""dax"" are red instead of their usual green.

5. Input: lug wif
   Output: blue red
   
   ""wif"" is after ""lug,"" and the output is red, which is different from the blue that ""lug"" produces, suggesting ""wif"" results in red.

Combining these observations, the rule seems to be:
When ""wif"" appears before another word, that word outputs red instead of its usual color. Red is the resultant color regardless of the usual color of the word that follows ""wif.""

Rule: wif -> Changes the following word's output color to red.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that words are translated into specific colors:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""
- ""walm"" also consistently translates to ""green"" except when following ""zup,"" where it translates to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" except when following ""zup,"" where it translates to ""yellow""
- ""zup"" does not have a consistent color output; rather, it seems to affect the word that follows it:
  - When ""zup"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output is ""yellow"" instead of the typical ""green"" associated with ""dax.""
  - When ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow"" instead of ""green.""
  - When ""zup"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""yellow"" instead of ""blue.""
  - When ""zup"" is followed by ""wif,"" there is no change, as ""wif"" output is always ""red""

Given this information, the rule for ""zup"" is that it changes the output color of the following word to ""yellow,"" except when the following word is ""wif,"" in which case ""zup"" does not have an effect on the output color. So, we can deduce:

Rule: zup -> changes the next word's associated color to yellow, except when the next word is ""wif""
Based on the examples provided, each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. The outputs are consistent in their color assignments for each input word:

- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""

The nonce word ""bluf"" appears in each input followed or preceded by different words. Every time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> blue. The meaning of ""bluf"" is the color ""blue.""
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.

Based on the examples:

- In ""wif lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"".
- In ""wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", so ""walm"" means ""red red red"".
- In ""zup dax walm lug wif"", ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""walm"" gives us ""green green green"".
- In ""zup walm"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", hence ""walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In ""dax walm wif bluf"", ""dax"" means ""green"" and thus ""walm"" results in ""green green green"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow,blue yellow,True,27
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""dax"". Let's examine the position and corresponding output for each occurrence of ""dax"":

1. wif dax -> red green
2. dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green
3. zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red
4. dax lug -> green blue
5. zup dax wif -> yellow green red

It appears that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color output ""green"" regardless of its position within the input. Moreover, the presence of other words affects the colored output according to their respective positions; but ""dax"" remains associated with ""green.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the rule for the word 'wif' seems consistent:

- In every instance where 'wif' appears, the output always starts with 'red'.
- When 'wif' appears alone or is the first word in a sequence, 'red' is still the output.

This pattern suggests that 'wif' is directly associated with the color 'red'.

Rule:
wif -> red
zup -> meaning. Meaning: yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence of words.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be dependent on the position of ""bluf"" relative to the other words and the colors those words correspond to.

When we analyze the occurrences of ""bluf"" in each example, we notice the following consistent pattern: the word right before ""bluf"" seems to dictate the first output color, which repeats once, and the word right after ""bluf"" seems to dictate the second output color, which repeats according to the number of times the color appears after ""bluf"" in the input list.

For example, in the first input: 
- The word before ""bluf"" is ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color blue, and in the output, blue appears twice.
- The word after ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red, and red appears once in the output.

In the second input:
- The word before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color yellow, and yellow appears twice in the output.
- The word after ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, and red appears three times in the output since ""walm"" (which follows ""wif"") also corresponds to red.

Given these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

bluf -> Output the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf"" twice, followed by the color corresponding to the word immediately after ""bluf,"" the number of times equal to the occurrences of that color in a row after ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf means that the word before it determines the first color to output twice, and the word after bluf determines the second color to output, repeated as many times as it sequentially appears after ""bluf"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. Here is the reasoning:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" so ""walm"" repeats the green attributed to ""dax.""
- In the third example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" again showing that ""walm"" is repeating the color of the preceding word, ""wif"" (red).
- The fourth example further confirms this with ""lug walm zup lug walm"" translating to ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue,"" so ""walm"" takes the color of ""lug"" (blue) and repeats it until a new color word appears.
- The last example has ""lug walm"" yielding ""blue blue blue,"" consistent with the rule observed.

Therefore, ""walm"" means the repetition of the last color mentioned. To write it as requested:

Rule: walm -> a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,28
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
From the provided examples, it seems that each word in the input maps to a color in the output. The occurrences of the word ""dax"" consistently translate to the color green in the output. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
Based on the given input/output pairs, it appears that zup translates to the color yellow regardless of the context it is used in. Each time zup is used, the output includes the word yellow. There is no variability in the output regarding zup that would suggest it has a more complex meaning or is context-dependent.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze its occurrences and the corresponding outputs:

1. The sequence ""bluf lug"" corresponds with ""blue green"" and also ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue"" in different examples.
2. The sequence ""wif bluf"" corresponds with ""red red,"" suggesting ""bluf"" could mean ""red."" However, the same pair in a different example leads to ""red blue.""
3. The sequence ""zup dax bluf"" corresponds with ""yellow green green,"" and since ""zup"" and ""dax"" correspond with ""yellow"" and ""green"" respectively, the ""bluf"" here again corresponds with ""green.""
4. In the sequence ""wif bluf zup,"" where ""bluf"" is preceded and followed by different words, the output sequence is ""red red yellow,"" suggesting that in this position, ""bluf"" corresponds with ""red.""

By comparing these instances, it seems ""bluf"" does not have a fixed color assigned to it, but its meaning might be context-dependent. Specifically, it looks like ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it. To confirm:

- In examples where ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" or ""dax,"" which correspond with blue and green respectively, ""bluf"" outputs blue and green respectively.
- In examples where ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds with red, ""bluf"" outputs red.
- There is no instance of ""bluf"" following ""zup,"" so we cannot confirm how it would behave in this context.

The rule for ""bluf"" could then be:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is the same as the color word immediately before it in the sequence. If ""bluf"" follows a word that correspondences to a color, the output for ""bluf"" is that color.
Upon examining the examples given, it appears that the word ""walm"" results in the word immediately preceding it being repeated three times in the output. This pattern holds true for each example provided. Therefore, ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition rule rather than translating directly to a specific color.

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color word immediately before ""walm"" three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule:
Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position within the sequence. There is no contextual dependency provided, suggesting that ""lug"" invariably means ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" seems to consistently correspond to the output ""green."" Therefore, the rule appears to be direct and consistent regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the sequence or the other words present.

Rule: dax -> green
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to look at the inputs and the outputs to identify any consistent patterns. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

1. ""zup wif lug wif"" -> ""yellow red blue red""
2. ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""
3. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""
4. ""dax bluf wif"" -> ""green green red""
5. ""lug wif lug"" -> ""blue red blue""

From these examples, we can see that every time the word ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output is ""red"". The examples also show that other nonce words (""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" ""walm"") map to different colors consistently. 

Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". Therefore:

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following patterns for the word 'zup' and its respective output:

1. Whenever 'zup' appears, the corresponding output is 'yellow'.
2. The output 'yellow' only appears when 'zup' is present in the input.
3. 'zup' does not seem to alter the output of other words (dax, bluf, lug, walm, wif), as their outputs do not change whether or not 'zup' is present.
4. The position of 'zup' in the sequence does not affect its corresponding output, as it leads to 'yellow' regardless of where it appears in the input sequence.

Given these observations, we can form the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: When the word 'zup' is present in an input sequence, the corresponding output is 'yellow'.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" observe the corresponding outputs:

- ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""
- ""dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""green green red blue""
- ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""
- ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" -> ""blue blue red blue red red red blue""
- ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" -> ""blue red red green blue blue""

Now, let's analyze:

- In the first example, ""dax wif bluf"" results in ""green red red."" Compared to the second example, ""dax bluf wif lug,"" we notice that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Since ""bluf"" appears with different outputs (""red"" in the first case and ""green"" in the second), it implies that ""bluf"" is context-dependent and not a static color.

- In the second example, ""dax bluf wif lug,"" the output ""bluf"" generates is the same as the color corresponding to ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

- In the third example, ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" here takes the color of ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" occurs twice, and each time it matches the color of the word preceding it. For example, ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue,"" and ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red.""

- The same pattern is seen in the fifth example, where ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word.

Based on the observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" changes its meaning based on the word preceding it, matching the color that the preceding word translates to. If ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" then ""bluf"" after any of these words takes on the respective color of ""green,"" ""blue,"" or ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word immediately preceding it.
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the following word to have its color output repeated three times, according to a predetermined color for each word:

- ""dax"" results in green
- ""zup"" results in yellow
- ""lug"" results in blue
- ""wif"" results in red

If we turn this observation into a rule for ""walm,"" it could be stated as:

Rule: walm -> triggers the tripling of the following word's associated color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. Each instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green
By analyzing the given examples and their respective outputs, we can make some observations:

- Whenever the word ""wif"" is present, the color ""red"" is part of the output.
- The word ""dax"" when combined with ""wif"" results in the output ""red green"".
- The word ""lug"" when combined with ""wif"" results in the output ""red blue"".
- In the third example, ""zup"" seems to produce ""yellow"" as output, and since ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"", and we see a repetition of ""red"" matching the number of ""wif"" instances, we can assume that ""walm"" does not change the output associated with ""wif"".
- In the fourth example, we have a sequence of ""wif"" associated words ""dax"" and ""lug"" and multiple ""wif"" appearing one after another. The ""red"" color is consistently present for each ""wif"" and the respective color that follows (green or blue) is dependent on the word that comes after ""wif"" (either ""dax"" or ""lug"").
- In the last example, the additional ""lug"" at the end reproduces the ""red blue"" output, just like when ""wif lug"" is given alone.

Considering these observations, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be that it translates to ""red"" in the output regardless of its position or the words that come after it.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in every given example.
bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" is present in the input, it takes the color associated with the word directly preceding it and repeats that color in the output.
walm -> yellow. Rule: The word ""walm"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

    Rules:
Based on the input and output examples provided, it can be deduced that the nonce word ""lug"" represents the color ""blue."" In every instance where ""lug"" appears, the corresponding output is ""blue."" Therefore, the rule can be written as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output each time it is present in the input. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, it translates to ""green"" in the output.
Rule: Each occurrence of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the output. 

wif -> red
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow in all given examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns in each example.

In all instances where ""bluf"" appears, the output is a repetition of the previous color word. So ""bluf"" seems to induce repetition in the sequence that follows. Here's a breakdown:

1. Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and immediately after ""bluf,"" ""red"" is repeated.

2. Input: wif lug zup bluf -> Output: red blue yellow yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and immediately after ""bluf,"" ""yellow"" is repeated.

3. Input: wif bluf lug -> Output: red red blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and immediately after ""bluf,"" ""red"" is repeated.

4. Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and immediately after ""bluf,"" ""yellow"" is repeated.

5. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf -> Output: green red green yellow yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and immediately after ""bluf,"" ""yellow"" is repeated.

bluf -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:
Bluf indicates that the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word should be repeated in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" indicates repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times. Each unique word before ""walm"" has a color associated with it, and the usage of ""walm"" after that word repeats the corresponding color three times. Here's the breakdown:

- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"": ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"": ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""lug walm"" within the third input leads to ""blue blue blue"": ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""wif walm"" within the fifth input sequence outputs ""red red red"": ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Therefore, we can induce:

Rule: Walm -> ""Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each given example.
Based on the examples provided, the consistent pattern is that the word ""dax"" is always translated to the color ""green"". The other words in the inputs correspond to different colors, and ""dax"" does not seem to change its meaning based on position or the presence of other words in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif"" from the provided examples, let's examine the input and corresponding output for patterns.

1. zup wif bluf zup lug -> yellow red red yellow blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""bluf"" is not repeated elsewhere, but its output is ""red""

2. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" does not have a standalone example, but its output involves repeating ""red""

3. wif walm -> red red red
   - ""walm"" appears again with repeated ""red"" output

4. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" is followed by repeated ""red"" output

5. zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green green green yellow red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" again precedes repeated ""red""
   - ""wif"" is at the end and corresponds to a single ""red""

From the examples, whenever ""wif"" appears before ""walm,"" the output is a series of ""red"" after each occurrence of ""wif."" However, when ""wif"" is at the end or without ""walm"" following, it corresponds to a single ""red.""

Rule: 
The word ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red."" When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" it causes the color ""red"" to repeat an unspecified number of times (potentially corresponding to each following element or the presence of ""walm""). When ""wif"" is at the end of a sequence or does not precede ""walm,"" it corresponds to a single ""red.""

wif -> red (potentially repeating depending on context, particularly before ""walm"")
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow."" There is no variation in the output that corresponds to ""zup"" despite the different words or order of words surrounding it. Therefore, ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Bluf -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, we can observe that whenever the word ""bluf"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is ""red."" 

Rule: bluf translates to red.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" causes the following word to repeat the color that corresponds to it. In other words, the word after ""walm"" does not get translated to its own color but rather duplicates the color of the word before ""walm"". For instance:

- In the first example, ""lug zup walm"" results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""walm"" causes the next word to also be yellow.
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" where ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" causes another red. There is no word after ""walm"" here, but we infer it means the same color repeats.
- In the third example, ""lug walm dax"" results in ""blue blue blue green,"" where ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" causes another blue, and then ""dax"" finally changes the color to green.

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word, causing the following word to assume the same color.

dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the given examples.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs to identify a consistent pattern.

Input: wif
Output: red
Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
Rule: Other words must also correspond to specific colors; ""wif"" still corresponds to the color red.

Input: wif dax wif
Output: red green red
Rule: ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red.

Input: wif
Output: red
Rule: ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red, reaffirmed.

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow
Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color red; another word, ""zup,"" corresponds to the color yellow.

From these examples, it seems clear that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence of words.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" under all given circumstances. Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> red

It consistently follows that each place ""bluf"" appears, the output result is ""red,"" regardless of the surrounding context or the words that appear before or after it.
To figure out what the nonce word ""walm"" means, let's analyze the repeating patterns within the examples:

- When the input contains ""dax lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue blue blue."" The response to ""dax"" is ""green,"" and the response to ""lug"" is ""blue,"" so ""walm"" seems to repeat the last color mentioned three times.

- In the case of ""zup wif walm,"" where ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""walm"" repeats the ""red"" color three times.

- The input ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" gives us ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" but we know from the previous examples that ""lug"" is ""blue."" Since ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and we get three ""yellow"" after it, it seems to reinforce that ""walm"" repeats the last color mentioned three times.

- With the input ""wif lug walm,"" the output is ""red blue blue blue."" The first part lines up with the colors we know for ""wif"" and ""lug,"" and ""walm"" then repeats ""blue"" three times.

- Finally, in the case of ""dax walm,"" the output is ""green green green."" Since there is no color after ""dax,"" ""walm"" just repeats the ""green"" associated with ""dax"" three times.

Based on these patterns, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be repeating the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times. So, if the word before ""walm"" has an assigned color, ""walm"" will result in that color being repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" means to repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position or the other words around it.
dax -> green

Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" represents the color red, irrespective of its position in the sequence.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
bluf -> meaning. Based on the given examples, bluf means ""red."" However, the meaning seems to depend on the word that precedes it in the sequence. If the previous word is ""wif,"" then bluf means ""red""; if the previous word is ""dax,"" then bluf means ""green.""

Rule: The color indicated by the word ""bluf"" is determined by the preceding word. If the preceding word translates to ""red,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""red."" If the preceding word translates to ""green,"" then ""bluf"" also translates to ""green."" If there are no examples of bluf following other words, we cannot further define the rules without additional information.
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,35
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of dax, let's look for patterns in the inputs and correlate them with the outputs:

- In every sequence where ""dax"" appears, the output starts with ""green.""
- The other words in the sequence seem to correspond to other colors in the output, and they are consistent across examples. For instance, ""lug"" always maps to ""blue,"" ""wif"" always maps to ""red,"" and ""zup"" always maps to ""yellow.""

Given these observations, it seems that words in the input sequence are mapped to specific colors in the output sequence. 

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

- ""dax"" -> ""green""
- Other words have their own color mappings.

Rule: Each word in the input is translated to a specific color in the output, where ""dax"" always translates to ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The term ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in these examples. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
zup -> yellow. Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" consistently across all examples.
Based on the examples given, it seems that the word ""bluf"" in the inputs corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes before it in the output. 

To support this induction, let's see the correlation in each input-output pair:

- Input: wif walm lug bluf -> Output: red red red blue blue
Here ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" Hence, an additional ""blue"" appears in the output.

- Input: wif zup dax bluf -> Output: red yellow green green
Here ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" Therefore, an additional ""green"" is observed in the output.

- Input: zup bluf dax -> Output: yellow yellow green
""Bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and thus ""yellow"" is repeated in the output.

- Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
Here ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which again corresponds to ""yellow,"" and we see ""yellow"" is repeated.

- Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green
""Bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and this leads to ""red"" being repeated in the output.

To summarize the rule:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" means to repeat the color indicated by the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" in the output sequence.
Rule: The word ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. 

Evidence for this includes the fact that every time the word ""walm"" follows another, the color associated with that preceding word is repeated thrice in the output. 

For example:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Therefore:

walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning: blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"". Here are the instances that demonstrate this:

- ""lug wif dax"" translates to ""blue red green"". ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""; thus ""dax"" must represent ""green"".
- ""dax zup"" translates to ""green yellow"". Since ""zup"" comes after ""dax"" and corresponds to ""yellow"", it is clear that ""dax"" means ""green"".
- ""wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""red blue green green green"". ""Wif"" translates to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and since ""walm"" doesn't appear in previous examples but is repeated as ""green"" three times following ""dax"", it suggests that both ""dax"" and ""walm"" mean ""green"".
- ""zup bluf dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow green"". ""Zup"" is repeated as ""yellow"", and since ""bluf"" is a new term but repeats the ""yellow"" color, it is probably another word for ""yellow"". Thus, ""dax"" is left to mean ""green"".
- ""zup dax walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green blue red"". Here ""zup"", ""lug"", and ""wif"" retain their earlier meanings. The word ""dax"" is followed by ""green"", and ""walm"" is still translated as ""green"" multiple times. Hence, ""dax"" signifies ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the input and output provided, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a color as follows:

- wif -> red
- bluf -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue (single instance)
- walm -> blue (repeated for emphasis or quantity)

Given this pattern, the meaning of ""wif"" can be consistently inferred as ""red."" Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples:

- When ""zup"" appears alone, the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output adds ""blue.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output adds ""red.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output adds ""green.""
- The word that follows ""zup"" changes the color that is added to the output.
- Repeated non-""zup"" words carry their same output (as seen with ""wif"" leading to ""red"" repeatedly).

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" and it can precede other words that correspond to different colors, which are added to the output in the order they appear.

Rule: ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: bluf -> blue.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to lead to the output ""blue"" repeated a number of times corresponding to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Let's analyze the examples:

Input: dax lug walm                 Output: green blue blue blue
Input: lug walm dax                 Output: blue blue blue green
Input: lug zup walm lug             Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
Input: dax walm zup lug dax         Output: green green green yellow blue green
Input: zup lug walm wif dax         Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

In the first example, ""walm"" appears third and results in ""blue"" being repeated three times. In the second example, ""walm"" is second, so ""blue"" is repeated twice. Continuing this pattern through the rest of the examples, it seems that ""walm"" dictates the repetition of ""blue"" based on its position in the input list.

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" is replaced by the word ""blue"" repeated as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the input list.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. This is consistent across all examples provided.
Based on the examples provided:

Input: dax lug wif -> Output: green blue red
Input: zup dax -> Output: yellow green
Input: zup dax -> Output: yellow green
Input: zup wif dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow red green red red
Input: dax bluf wif -> Output: green green red

The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" Regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the sequence, the output always includes the color ""green."" Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the nonce word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red'. Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present, whenever 'wif' is an input, 'red' is consistently part of the output. There are no exceptions to this pattern in the examples provided.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the color indicated by the word preceding bluf, repeated twice. Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another word, it takes the color meaning of that word and outputs it twice.
Rule: When the word ""walm"" is present, the output color is a repetition of three of the immediately preceding color, followed by ""blue.""

Input: wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""walm"" -> blue blue blue (repeating the ""lug"" color) and then ""blue""

Therefore, the rule is:

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word is associated with a specific color:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output includes ""green"".
- The presence of ""lug"" correlates with the output ""blue"".
- The presence of ""wif"" correlates with the output ""red"".
- The presence of ""zup"" correlates with the output ""yellow"".
- The word ""bluf"" appears to correspond to the output ""green"" too. However, it must be noted that ""bluf"" results in ""green"" being mentioned twice in the fourth input when no other color is repeated, suggesting that ""bluf"" might reinforce or duplicate the color associated with the following word.

This information allows us to distill that the color associated with ""dax"" is consistently green whenever it appears in the input.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that wif corresponds to a specific color each time it is mentioned. Across all examples, whenever the word wif appears in the input, the word red appears in the same position in the output. There is no variation in this pattern, suggesting that wif is directly associated with the color red, regardless of its position or the context given by surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples provided, every time the word ""zup"" appears, it corresponds to the color yellow in the output. Here's the breakdown:

- ""wif dax zup wif"" translates to ""red green yellow red"", with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"".
- ""wif dax zup dax"" translates to ""red green yellow green"", with ""zup"" again corresponding to ""yellow"".
- ""wif walm dax zup"", translates to ""red red red green yellow"" - the only novel element towards the end is ""zup"", which gives us ""yellow"".
- ""dax zup lug wif lug"" translates to ""green yellow blue red blue"", with ""zup"" corresponding to the second color ""yellow"".
- ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow"", with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"".

This consistent one-to-one correspondence allows us to induce that the meaning of ""zup"" in this context is the color ""yellow"".
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color output that repeats the color output of the word immediately preceding it. Here's the analysis:
- In the first input, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" is followed by another ""red"".
- In the second input, ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red"" and is followed by ""bluf"" outputting another ""red"".
- In the third input, ""wif"" is ""red"" and is followed by ""bluf"", which is again ""red"".
- In the fourth input, ""wif"" alone followed by ""bluf"" yields two ""reds"" back-to-back with no other color in between.
- In the fifth input, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by ""bluf"" which is also ""yellow"".

Rule: bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before it.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" inherits the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Here is the analysis of each example:

1. Input: ""wif walm dax zup""
   Output: ""red red red green yellow""
   ""wif"" is translated to ""red,"" and ""walm"" that follows it is also ""red.""

2. Input: ""zup lug walm""
   Output: ""yellow blue blue blue""
   ""lug"" is translated to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" that follows it is also ""blue.""

3. Input: ""lug walm wif lug bluf""

   ""lug"" is translated to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" that follows it is also ""blue.""

4. Input: ""zup walm dax lug""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow green blue""
   ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" that follows it is also ""yellow.""

5. Input: ""dax zup dax walm""
   Output: ""green yellow green green green""
   ""dax"" is translated to ""green,"" and ""walm"" that follows it is also ""green.""

Rule: walm -> inherits the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. The meaning of ""lug"" appears to be the color blue, regardless of the context.

Rule: ""lug"" substitutes for the word ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" However, let's take a closer look at each example to confirm this:

- In the first input, ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf,"" we have the corresponding output ""blue red red green blue blue."" The word ""dax"" directly corresponds to ""green"" in this sequence.

- In the second input, ""dax lug,"" the output is ""green blue."" Here again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

- In the third input, which is simply ""dax,"" we have the output ""green."" This direct association further confirms the meaning.

- In the fourth input, ""wif dax bluf,"" the output is ""red green green,"" once again showing ""dax"" as ""green.""

- Finally, in the fifth input, ""dax lug dax lug wif,"" the output is ""green blue green blue red."" The two instances of ""dax"" both correspond to ""green.""

From these examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output always ends with the color red, irrespective of the other elements in the sequence.
zup -> meaning. Meaning appears to be the word ""yellow,"" regardless of the context. Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" is used, it translates to ""yellow.""
bluf -> meaning. Looking at the outputs corresponding to inputs where 'bluf' is present, we can observe the following pattern:

1. In examples where 'bluf' follows 'dax', the output for 'bluf' is 'green'.
2. In examples where 'bluf' follows 'wif' or 'zup', the output for 'bluf' is 'red'.
3. In examples where 'bluf' follows 'lug', the output for 'bluf' is 'blue'.

Therefore, the meaning of 'bluf' is dependent on the context, specifically the word that precedes it. Rule:
- 'bluf' means 'green' after 'dax'.
- 'bluf' means 'blue' after 'lug'.
- 'bluf' means 'red' after 'wif' or 'zup'.
Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the color associated with the previous word followed by one red.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, ""lug"" appears to be a nonce word that is linked to a corresponding color output. In all cases where ""lug"" appears, the color ""blue"" is part of the output sequence. Observing the input and corresponding output sequences, ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, we can deduce the following:

Rule: lug -> ""blue""
Analyzing the examples given and the corresponding output:

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

Input: zup dax lug
Output: yellow green blue

Input: wif dax wif
Output: red green red

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

From these examples, we can try to determine what ""dax"" corresponds to in the outputs:

1. In the first line, ""dax"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output of ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""dax"" outputs ""green."" 
2. In the second line, ""dax"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""lug,"" the outputs are ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" respectively. The ""dax"" again outputs ""green.""
3. In the third line, ""dax"" is both preceded and followed by ""wif,"" which outputs ""red,"" and the ""dax"" still outputs ""green.""
4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" is followed by different words (""zup"" and ""bluf"") and still results in ""green"" each time.
5. In the fifth example, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" and it still results in ""green.""

In each case, regardless of the preceding or following words, the output for ""dax"" is ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" can be consistently associated with the color ""red."" Each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the corresponding output.

Thus, the rule can be stated as:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" is an input, ""red"" is included in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must look at the association between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. The word ""bluf"" seems to be tied to a specific color output, which changes based on the words around it.

For the first input, ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""dax"" before and after, resulting in ""yellow."" However, ""dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green."" This suggests that ""bluf"" may be modifying the color output associated with ""dax.""

In the second input, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and both produce ""blue."" It seems that ""bluf"" adopts the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

In the third input, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and both words output ""red."" As with the second input, ""bluf"" mirrors the color of the preceding word.

The fourth input reinforces the hypothesis, as ""bluf"" again follows ""wif"" and both have the output ""red,"" and when followed by ""lug,"" ""bluf"" changes the output to ""blue,"" consistent with the color of ""lug.""

The fifth input further supports the idea, with ""bluf"" following ""lug"" and ""dax"" and adopting the colors ""blue"" and ""green,"" respectively, as associated with these words.

From these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color output associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

So:

bluf -> Takes on the color output of the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" translates to repeating the color associated with the previous word three times. For instance:

- In ""wif walm dax,"" ""wif"" is translated as ""red."" ""Walm"" following ""wif"" results in ""red red red.""
- In ""zup walm dax lug,"" ""zup"" is translated as ""yellow,"" and after ""walm"" is used, ""yellow yellow yellow"" appears.
- In ""dax walm zup lug,"" ""dax"" is translated as ""green,"" and ""walm"" gives ""green green green.""

It does not seem to matter what word follows ""walm""; the previous color is simply repeated three times. 

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each instance of ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. Here is the rule extracted from the examples:

Rule: lug -> ""blue""
Given the examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs. Here is how this conclusion is reached:

- In each instance where ""dax"" appears, the word ""green"" also appears in the respective output at the same position.
- The word ""dax"" is not dependent on the position in the sentence, as it appears in different positions and always maps to ""green.""
- In all outputs, every other word that surrounds ""dax"" correlates with a different color. For example, ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" maps to ""blue."" These words maintain their respective color outputs regardless of the position of ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" can be defined as:

dax -> ""green""
Rule: wif -> red

Each instance of the word ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the word ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: bluf -> blue
Explanation: In every example, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. The context or position of the word ""bluf"" does not seem to influence its meaning, as it constantly translates to ""blue"" regardless of surrounding words.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to correlate with repeating the color associated with the word that directly precedes it an additional two times. Here is the induction based on the given input-output pairs:

1. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" translates to ""red blue green blue red red red blue red."" We see that ""wif"" which means red is followed by ""walm"" which causes ""red"" to repeat two more times, making three reds in a row.

2. ""dax wif walm"" translates to ""green red red red."" Again, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in ""red"" being repeated two more times.

3. ""lug walm zup"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow."" Here ""lug"" means blue, which is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in two more ""blue.""

4. ""wif walm zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" ""Wif"" means red, and ""zup"" means yellow, with both followed by ""walm,"" each causing their colors to be repeated two additional times.

5. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" The word ""zup"" meaning yellow is followed by ""walm,"" once again leading to ""yellow"" being repeated two more times.

Rule: walm -> results in the repetition of the color of the preceding word two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm wif
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow red,yellow yellow yellow red,True,42
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the outputs, regardless of its position in the input string.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" I will analyze the given examples and outputs.

Input: dax
Output: green
- Here, ""dax"" directly translates to ""green.""

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- ""wif"" and ""walm"" both translate to ""red,"" and ""zup"" translates to yellow. Importantly, ""dax"" still translates to ""green"" regardless of its position.

Input: lug dax zup dax wif
Output: blue green yellow green red
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""dax"" is consistently ""green,"" again regardless of its position.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- Each occurrence of ""dax"" results in ""green,"" and since ""walm"" followed ""dax,"" it also translated to ""green."" 

In the prior examples, ""wif"" and ""walm"" have translated to ""red"" when ""dax"" was not preceding them. Here ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which suggests that ""dax"" may affect the word following it.

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
- ""dax"" first translates to ""green,"" but ""lug,"" which normally is ""blue,"" comes after ""dax"" unchanged, which breaks the pattern of ""dax"" affecting the following word. ""walm"" which followed ""lug"" also translates to ""blue"" instead of the expected ""red."" ""zup"" again is ""yellow"" and ""wif"" returns to ""red.""

Rule:

dax -> green
- We can conclude with certainty that ""dax"" means ""green,"" since in every example, ""dax"" always results in the color ""green"" regardless of its position.

There might be additional, more complex rules affecting the other words in sequences where ""dax"" is present, or there might be inaccuracies in the provided outputs. However, with the given information, we can only confirm the consistent translation of ""dax"" to ""green.""
Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in every instance it is used.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" is translated to a color repeated as many times as the immediately preceding color mentioned before it in the sequence. To illustrate:

- In the first example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" means blue, and ""bluf"" repeats that color.
- In the second example, there's no color before ""bluf,"" so it only repeats the previous color once, ""yellow,"" which is represented by ""zup.""
- In the third example, ""lug bluf"" again translates to ""blue blue"" following the same logic.
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" as ""wif"" means red, and ""bluf"" repeats it.
- The fifth example is straightforward as ""wif bluf"" directly translates to ""red red.""

Rule: bluf -> The color word that immediately precedes ""bluf"" is repeated as many times as that color was in sequence before ""bluf."" If no color precedes it, ""bluf"" repeats the last mentioned color only once.
Walm -> repetition of the color associated with the previous word. Rule:

- When ""lug"" appears before ""walm,"" the resulting output is ""blue blue blue,"" which suggests that ""lug"" translates to the color blue, and ""walm"" indicates a repetition of that color.
- When ""wif"" appears before ""walm,"" the resulting output is ""red red red,"" which suggests that ""wif"" translates to the color red, and ""walm"" similarly indicates a repetition of the preceding color.
- When ""zup"" appears before ""lug"" and then followed by ""walm,"" as in ""zup lug zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" here ""zup"" translates to the color yellow, ""lug"" to blue, and ""walm"" leads to the repetition of yellow after ""zup"" is repeated, even though ""lug"" appears between the ""zup"" and ""walm.""
- When ""zup"" is before ""wif"" followed by ""walm,"" the sequence ""zup wif walm"" gives us ""yellow red red red,"" which continues to support the idea that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word (""wif"" in this case).
- The last example, ""lug walm,"" again outputs ""blue blue blue,"" reinforcing the initial rule observed.

Therefore, ""walm"" indicates that the color associated with the preceding word should be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output across all provided examples.
Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, where each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color output, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or the rule behind the word ""wif."" Let's analyze each instance:

1. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow
   Here ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

2. Input: wif dax wif lug wif
   Output: red green red blue red
   Here ""wif"" appears three times and corresponds to ""red"" each time.

3. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
   Output: yellow yellow red blue green
   Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   In this case, ""wif"" is at the end and corresponds to ""red.""

5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   Once again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Based on these examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence of words.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Each time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to be translated differently depending on the context. However, it appears that ""bluf"" causes the word before it to be repeated in the output. Let's analyze the examples given:

1. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   (""zup"" is ""yellow"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" ""yellow"" is repeated).

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   (""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""yellow"" is repeated when ""bluf"" follows).

3. Input: zup bluf lug zup
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow
   (Again ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated).

4. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   (The pattern holds with ""yellow"" being repeated).

5. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   (""dax"" is ""green"" and it is repeated after ""bluf"").

Rule: bluf -> causes the translation of the word immediately before it to be repeated in the output.
Based on the provided examples, each instance where the word ""walm"" appears, the output seems to be a sequence of one ""red"" followed by a repetition of another color word. The repeating color word in the output corresponds to a word that immediately precedes ""walm"" in the input. Here is the analysis of the examples which leads to the rule induction:

1. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   Analysis: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" precedes the first ""walm"" and the sequence follows with three ""green"" then ""red"" and two instances of the next color, which is again ""red.""

2. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   Analysis: ""lug"" maps to ""blue"", and after ""walm"" there is one ""red"" followed by the color corresponding to ""lug"" which is ""blue"".

3. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   Analysis: ""dax"" stands for ""green"", ""walm"" appears twice and each time it is followed by ""red"" and repeats of the color word just before it, ""green"" after the first ""walm"" and ""green"" after the second ""walm"".

4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   Analysis: Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"" and hence after ""red"" we see ""blue"" repeated.

5. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   Analysis: ""lug"" equals ""blue"", so after ""walm"" we see a ""red"" followed by ""yellow"" which corresponds to ""zup"" that comes before the next ""wif"".

Based on this analysis, ""walm"" seems to be an instruction for a color pattern in the following form:
- First, output ""red"".
- Next, repeat the color word that appeared immediately before ""walm"" in the input.

Therefore, the rule is:

walm -> meaning: Output ""red"" followed by repetitions of the color corresponding to the word just before ""walm"".

Rule: When ""walm"" appears after a color word in the input, the output is ""red"" followed by the color of the preceding word in the input repeated.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each instance of the word ""dax"" in the input results in the word ""green"" in the output.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the given outputs.
Based on the provided examples, the following patterns emerge:

- Whenever the word 'zup' is present, the output always includes the color 'yellow'.
- The word 'wif' always corresponds to the color 'red'.
- The presence of 'dax' translates to the color 'green'.
- The word 'walm' seems to correspond to the color 'red' when it appears after 'wif', but it results in 'yellow' when it appears after 'zup' or on its own.

Parsing each example:

1. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   Analysis: 'zup' translates to 'yellow', 'wif' to 'red', and 'bluf' has no direct translation but still results in 'red'.
   
2. Input: dax zup dax zup wif
   Output: green yellow green yellow red
   Analysis: 'dax' translates to 'green', 'zup' to 'yellow', and 'wif' to 'red'. Since 'zup' follows 'dax', it maintains its translation to 'yellow'.

3. Input: zup
   Output: yellow
   Analysis: The sole instance of 'zup' translates directly to 'yellow'.

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Analysis: 'zup' translates to 'yellow', 'wif' to 'red', and 'walm' following 'wif' results in 'red'. This suggests the color for 'walm' may depend on its position or preceding words.

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: 'zup' translates to 'yellow', and 'walm' following 'zup' also results in 'yellow'. This differs from the previous interpretation of 'walm'.

Considering the examples consistently and collectively, it seems that 'zup' on its own means 'yellow'. Other words in the examples may modify the meaning of subsequent words, but for each instance of 'zup', the meaning is consistent:

Rule: 'zup' -> yellow.
Bluf -> green when following ""dax""; yellow when following ""zup"". Rule: The color indicated by ""bluf"" depends on the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""dax"", ""bluf"" translates to green. If the preceding word is ""zup"", ""bluf"" translates to yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the provided inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""wif walm zup walm""
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
   The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red red,"" and ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" seems to be followed by three of a color, based on the pattern we see with ""zup walm.""

2. ""zup walm""
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   ""Zup"" on its own results in ""yellow,"" but the appearance of the word ""walm"" after any word results in a triple repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

3. ""lug walm zup lug walm""
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   Once again, ""lug"" on its own is associated with ""blue,"" and ""walm"" results in a triple repetition of that color.

4. ""wif bluf dax walm""
   Output: red red green green green
   The pattern here remains consistent. ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""bluf"" isn't given, but ""dax"" corresponds with the color ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times.

5. ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm""
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   In this example, each word has a color associated with it, and ""walm"" once again causes a triple repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes a triple repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> causes a triple repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning based on the usage in the examples appears to be a specific color. Rule: lug means blue.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time the nonce word ""dax"" is used in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the output.

Thus, the rule can be stated as:

dax -> green

Rule: When the nonce word ""dax"" is present in the input, it is translated to ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word has a specific color associated with it. Here's the associations according to the input-output pairs:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> red
- walm -> red (this is inferred since ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red"" and we know that ""wif"" is associated with the color red)

Thus, it seems reasonable to deduce that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently results in the output ""yellow."" It does not seem to be affected by its position in the sentence or the words around it. Therefore, the rule can be inferred as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it can be deduced that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Thus:

Rule: bluf -> blue.
walm -> the word preceding 'walm' repeated thrice in translation. 

Rule: When 'walm' follows a word, it translates to that word being outputted three times. For example, if 'lug' precedes 'walm', 'lug' translates to 'blue', so the output will include 'blue' three times. Similarly, if 'wif' precedes 'walm', 'wif' translates to 'red', and the output will contain 'red' three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the word ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"".

Reasoning:
- Every instance where ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- ""dax"" stands alone as an input, the output is ""green.""
- ""dax"" occurs within a sequence of other words, but regardless of its position, the word ""green"" appears in the output.

Conclusion:
dax -> green
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to analyze its association with the output color in each instance. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""wif"" by itself outputs ""red.""
2. ""lug wif walm"" outputs ""blue red red red."" Since ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" and ""walm"" has no introduction, we can assume ""walm"" is repeating the previous color.
3. ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" outputs ""blue red red green blue blue,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" has no precedent and outputs ""green,"" ""dax"" also outputs ""green,"" and the subsequent ""bluf"" repeats the previous ""green"" converted into ""blue.""
4. ""dax walm wif bluf"" outputs ""green green green red red,"" indicating ""dax"" stands for ""green,"" ""walm"" repeats the color, and ""bluf"" with no precedent repeats the last output twice, once as ""red.""

From this analysis, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" represents ""red,"" and when it comes after an unknown word (such as ""walm"" or ""bluf""), it repeats the color it is associated with. 

However, we notice ""wif"" always results in ""red,"" regardless of the words around it. Although some contexts repeat colors, it is always clear for ""wif"" that it turns into ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" every time it is mentioned, regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" is consistent and does not depend on surrounding words or their order. Here is the rule based on the examples:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, when analyzing the input and the respective output patterns, ""bluf"" translates to a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it in the input. This rule holds true across all given examples, no matter the position of ""bluf"" within the sequence.

For instance:
- In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green"" while ""bluf"" results in ""green green"".
- In the second example, ""wif"" precedes the first ""bluf"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", hence ""bluf"" results in ""red red"".
- Similarly, in all other examples, ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

Therefore, the rule is: bluf -> it repeats the color of the word before it in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"" by examining the patterns in input and their corresponding outputs. Here's a breakdown of each example with a focus on the use of ""walm"":

1. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in two greens.

2. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in two blues, then a green follows ""dax"".

3. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" and produces two blues. 

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" here and results in two reds, then a green follows ""dax"", and ""zup"" yields a yellow.

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" and produces two reds.

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. The color sequence continues uninterrupted until a new word comes into play that changes the sequence. In the fifth example, the presence of ""zup wif"" before ""walm"" results in ""yellow red red red"" indicating that ""walm"" is directly influencing the repeat of the color red, which corresponds to ""wif.""

Walm -> meaning. Walm causes the repetition of the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input sequence, the output color of the word just before ""walm"" is repeated once.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, it seems that every time the nonce word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. We see this is consistent across all provided inputs with the word ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following:

- In the first example, ""dax zup lug"" translates to ""green yellow blue."" Therefore, we may infer that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" This leaves ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow."" Here, ""wif"" likely corresponds to ""red,"" confirming our earlier inference that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" translates to ""red yellow yellow red green."" We have already matched ""wif"" with ""red"" and ""dax"" with ""green,"" so ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"" remains consistent. We can ignore ""bluf"" for the purpose of determining the meaning of ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue."" Our previous inferences about ""dax"" being ""green,"" ""wif"" being ""red,"" and ""lug"" being ""blue"" again leave ""zup"" consistently translating to ""yellow.""
- The fifth example gives us ""zup"" translating directly to ""yellow,"" further strengthening our inference.

From these observations, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is consistent throughout all examples.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. The word ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" when it follows ""lug,"" to ""green"" when it follows ""dax,"" and to ""red"" when it follows ""wif."" The color that ""bluf"" corresponds to depends on the word that precedes it.

Rule: If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue."" If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green."" If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is ""red."" Additionally, the word preceding ""bluf"" is also translated into its corresponding color.
Walm -> meaning. Rule: walm causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes just before it, three times.

For instance:
- In ""lug zup dax walm"", the color before walm is green (from dax), thus walm turns into three greens.
- In ""lug wif walm"", the color before walm is red (from wif), so walm translates to three reds.
- In ""dax walm zup"", the color before walm is green (from dax), leading to walm becoming three greens followed by the color corresponding to zup, which is yellow.
- In ""dax lug walm"", the color before walm is blue (from lug), so walm results in three blues.
- In ""wif walm dax zup"", the color before walm is red (from wif), making walm turn into three reds followed by the respective colors of dax and zup, which are green and yellow.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green.

Rule: The word ""dax"" always translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the series of words.
Rule: wif -> red

The given examples consistently associate the nonce word ""wif"" with the output ""red."" Therefore, it can be deduced that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the given context.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's analyze the provided inputs and their corresponding outputs by breaking down each example and examining the patterns.

1. Input: wif zup  ->  Output: red yellow
2. Input: wif zup  ->  Output: red yellow
3. Input: dax zup bluf  ->  Output: green yellow yellow
4. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax  ->  Output: yellow yellow red blue green
5. Input: lug zup wif lug  ->  Output: blue yellow red blue

From examples 1 and 2, we notice that ""wif zup"" consistently leads to ""red yellow,"" indicating that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

In example 3, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and based on our previous deduction, ""zup"" maintains its correspondence to ""yellow.""

In example 4, the output order is the same as the input order. Matching them directly gives us the following associations:
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" -> ""yellow""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""dax"" -> ""green""

Example 5 also follows the same pattern with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and again, ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Based on this analysis, the rule deduced is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, we want to determine the rule for the nonce word ""bluf."" Each non-nonce word seems to translate to a color, and ""bluf"" appears to yield different colors in different contexts. Let's examine the examples to identify a pattern:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" becomes ""green green"". From this, we might infer that ""bluf"" means ""green"" when following ""dax,"" but we need more evidence.

- In the second example, each instance of ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The word ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" once and translates to ""green,"" just like in the first example, but it also follows ""wif"" once and translates to ""yellow,"" which breaks the initial rule we thought of.

- In the third example, ""lug"" becomes ""blue"" and ""walm"" becomes ""blue,"" while ""dax"" is consistently ""green."" Here, ""bluf"" appears twice: it follows ""wif"" to produce ""red"" and it follows ""dax"" to produce ""red."" It seems ""bluf"" does not mean ""green"" and ""red"" consistently after ""wif"" and ""dax,"" as previously observed.

- In the fourth example, ""lug zup bluf dax"" is translated to ""blue yellow yellow green."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow"" and the corresponding output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""

- In the fifth example, ""zup lug bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue blue"" and ""zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow red."" Thus, in both instances where ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it translates to ""yellow.""

Now let's try to derive a rule:

The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding non-nonce word:
- If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the result is ""green.""
- If ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the result is ""red.""
- If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the result is ""yellow.""
- If ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the result is ""blue.""
- If ""walm"" precedes ""bluf,"" the result is the color corresponding to ""walm,"" but there's insufficient data to determine what that color is (although it could be ""blue"" as shown in the third example).

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" reflects the color of the immediately preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the immediate preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we'll look at its placement and the output colors in each example:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" and the output color is green, while the colors before and after are yellow and red, corresponding to ""zup"" and ""wif"" respectively.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" is again followed by ""dax"" giving us green, with ""wif"" both before and after ""walm dax,"" represented by red.
3. In the third example, ""walm"" appears twice. The first instance is followed by ""dax"" and again yields green; the second ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of three blue, related to ""lug.""
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" and the output is three times blue, the same color as ""lug"" in the previous example.
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup,"" both instances producing three colors—green and yellow, associated with ""dax"" and ""zup,"" respectively.

From this, we can observe that ""walm"" seems to cause the next word to output thrice, with the color tied to that next word. So, ""walm"" appears to mean ""repeat the next color three times.""

Rule: walm -> repeat the next color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax wif
    ",Output: blue green red,blue green red,True,49
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at how it affects the output in all given examples. 

1. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
2. ""dax zup dax zup"" -> ""green yellow green yellow""
3. ""zup dax lug"" -> ""yellow green blue""
4. ""dax lug bluf"" -> ""green blue blue""
5. ""lug dax wif lug"" -> ""blue green red blue""

Based on these examples, ""dax"" always maps to ""green"" regardless of its position in the string. We can see that every time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the exact same position in the output.

The rule is then:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples given, it seems that the word ""wif"" translates directly to the color ""red."" Each time the word ""wif"" appears in an input, the word ""red"" correspondingly appears in the output. Here is the breakdown:

- ""wif lug dax"" translates to ""red blue green,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue,"" where ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax walm wif zup"" translates to ""green green green red yellow,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""zup wif dax"" translates to ""yellow red green,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

So, the rule we can induce is:

wif -> red.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's analyze the examples provided in conjunction with the outputs. 

- When ""zup"" appears alone, the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" is paired with ""wif,"" the output has ""yellow"" before ""red.""
- When in a sequence as in ""zup bluf wif,"" ""yellow"" precedes the other colors without considering the position of ""zup.""
- The presence of ""zup"" with ""walm"" results in three ""yellow"" in the output, the same as the input length.
- When ""zup"" is in a sequence with other words, there is always a ""yellow"" in the output corresponding to ""zup.""

Based on these observations, we can induce that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the other words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" functions as a duplicator or repeater of the preceding word's associated color. Here's the pattern deduced from the input and output pairs:

- ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red"", suggesting ""wif"" means ""red"" and ""bluf"" repeats it.
- ""lug bluf"" becomes ""blue blue"", suggesting ""lug"" means ""blue"" and ""bluf"" repeats it.
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" includes a new word ""walm"". Considering the output ""red red red blue blue,"" it's reasonable to conclude that ""walm"" means ""red"" as well, and ""bluf"" repeats the last color mentioned, thus ""walm"" is red (like ""wif""), and ""lug"" is blue, each repeated by ""bluf"".

Therefore, the general rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" is:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the associated color of the immediately preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" has an effect on the words that immediately follow it. Specifically, it appears to repeat the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. For instance, in the first example, ""wif"" translates to the color red, and after ""walm"" is used, we see three reds in a row. In the third example, ""zup"" correlates to yellow, and the output is three yellows after ""walm"" without any other words in between.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: walm -> replaces the following words with the color associated with the word that directly precedes it, repeating that color for the number of words replaced.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm zup lug bluf wif
    ",Output: blue blue blue yellow blue red,blue blue blue yellow blue blue red,False,50
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the given examples, lug consistently translates to the word ""blue."" Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug means blue.
Rule: dax -> green. 

Based on the given examples, every instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Looking at the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or the rule for the nonce word ""zup"". Each example includes an input with one or more occurrences of ""zup"" and an output where ""zup"" is replaced with a color. Here's the analysis:

1. Input: wif zup lug zup lug
   Output: red yellow blue yellow blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" directly.

2. Input: wif zup dax
   Output: red yellow green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" directly.

3. Input: zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" directly.

4. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" directly.

5. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" directly.

Therefore, based on the examples, the rule for ""zup"" is consistent:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Meaning ""zup"" means ""yellow"" in the given context.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to relate to the word that immediately precedes it, which determines the color to be repeated in the output.

Here is my analysis:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, and the next word is also ""yellow"".
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output, and the next word is also ""green"".
- When ""wif"" precedes ""dax"" which precedes ""bluf"", it results in ""red green green"", so irrespective of ""wif"" being before ""dax"", the word ""bluf"" still causes the color corresponding to ""dax"" to be repeated.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeat the color that corresponds to the word that comes directly before ""bluf"".
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze how its presence affects the output compared to the other words in the examples.

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
Here ""walm"" appears to result in the word ""blue.""

Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow
Here ""walm"" again appears to result in the word ""green,"" which is the same color that ""dax"" corresponds to.

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red
In this case, ""walm"" results in the word ""red.""

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Here ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue,"" which is the same as ""lug.""

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue
In this example, ""walm"" corresponds to ""green,"" the same as ""dax.""

From the examples, it appears that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word immediately before it:

- In the first example, ""lug"" is before ""walm"" and both translate to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" is before ""walm"" and both result in ""green.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" is before ""walm"" and both translate to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" again, with both being ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" once more, with both yielding ""green.""

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: walm -> The color word that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. If ""walm"" is the first word, there isn't an example to infer from.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax walm lug bluf dax wif
    ",Output: yellow green green blue blue blue green red,yellow green green green blue blue green red,False,51
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue regardless of context within the examples provided.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in every given instance.
zup -> meaning. Based on the provided examples where the word ""zup"" consistently leads to the output ""yellow,"" and does so regardless of context (i.e., whether it is surrounded by other words or not), the rule appears to be:

Rule: zup means yellow.
Based on the given examples, it is possible to induce the following rule:

When adjacent to the word ""wif"" (red), ""bluf"" translates to ""red."" When adjacent to any other word, ""bluf"" translates to the color that corresponds to the previous word.

However, looking more closely at the examples:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" (blue) and translates to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" (green) and translates to ""green.""
- In the third and fifth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red) and translates to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and translates to ""yellow.""

From this pattern, we can induce that ""bluf"" translates to the same color as the word that follows it, except in cases where ""bluf"" is directly after ""wif,"" where it translates to ""red.""

Thus, the rule is:

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""red."" When ""bluf"" follows any other word, or is at the start of an input sequence, it translates to the same color as that of the word that follows it.

So the induction for ""bluf"" would be:

bluf -> the same color as the next word, unless it follows ""wif,"" then it means red.
Walm -> repeat the color of the previous word multiple times.

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word right before it. The number of repetitions appears to increase by one each time it is used in a sequence. For example, if ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which signifies ""yellow,"" it causes the output to be ""yellow"" repeated one more time than it was previously. If ""walm"" is used again, it causes ""yellow"" to be repeated two more times than the previous, and so on. The repetitions are reset when a new color word is introduced before ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every given example.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color ""green"" in the output. Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's examine the color outputs associated with ""wif"" in each input.

1. ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""walm"" (wif bluf dax walm) and ""bluf"" is associated with the color red as well as ""walm"".
2. ""wif"" appears before ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" and itself, and is followed by the colors red, green, red, and red (wif dax wif bluf zup wif).
3. ""wif"" precedes ""dax"" and follows ""lug,"" and is associated with the color red (lug wif dax bluf wif lug).
4. ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with the color red (wif walm).
5. ""wif"" precedes ""lug"" and is associated with the color red (wif lug).

In each instance, the appearance of ""wif"" directly correlates to the output of red. It appears that ""wif"" consistently results in the color red regardless of the word that follows it.

Rule: wif -> red. Meaning: Regardless of context, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

This rule indicates that the word ""zup"" is translated to or is synonymous with the word ""yellow"" in the outputs provided. Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context within the sequence of other words.
bluf -> blue

Rule: 'bluf' translates to the color blue regardless of the context in which it's used.
Analyzing the input-output pairs:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green 
   
   - 'wif' leads to 'red'
   - 'bluf' leads to another 'red'
   - 'dax' leads to a single 'green'
   - Following 'walm', there are two additional 'green' instances.

2. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   
   - 'wif' leads to 'red'
   - 'dax' leads to 'green'
   - 'zup' leads to a single 'yellow'
   - Following 'walm', there are two additional 'yellow' instances.

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   
   - 'zup' leads to 'yellow'
   - 'wif' leads to 'red'
   - Following 'walm', there are two additional 'red' instances.

4. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   
   - 'wif' leads to 'red'
   - Following 'walm', there are two additional 'red' instances.
   - 'lug' leads to 'blue' and is followed by an additional blue.

5. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   
   - 'wif' leads to 'red'
   - 'lug' leads to 'blue'
   - Following 'walm', there is one additional 'blue' instance.

From the examples, one can induce that the word 'walm' causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated twice more.

Therefore, the rule is:
walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word two more times.

Rule: walm duplicates the color corresponding to the word that comes directly before it, resulting in two more occurrences of that color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in all given examples.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color output. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input string or the words around it.

Thus, the rule can be articulated as:

Rule: dax -> green. ""Dax"" always means the color green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" correlates directly to the color ""red"" in each example provided.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" every time it appears in the input.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" causes the next word to be repeated with its corresponding color.

Here's the observed pattern:

- wif bluf -> red red
- dax bluf wif zup wif -> green green red yellow red
- lug bluf zup -> blue blue yellow
- wif bluf -> red red
- wif bluf -> red red

So the rule seems to be:

bluf -> Repeat the color of the following word.

Rule: When ""bluf"" appears before a word, output the color associated with that word twice.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color that immediately precedes it in the sequence. Let's analyze the sequences:

1. ""zup lug dax zup walm"" translates to ""yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" and so ""walm"" also translates to ""yellow.""

2. ""zup walm dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue."" In this sequence, ""walm"" again follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" resulting in ""walm"" translating to ""yellow.""

3. ""zup dax lug walm zup"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" so ""walm"" translates to ""blue.""

4. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" In this sequence, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which is ""red,"" so ""walm"" translates to ""red.""

5. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" In this sequence, ""walm"" again follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" resulting in ""walm"" also translating to ""yellow.""

Rule:
walm -> meaning. ""walm"" means to repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""walm.""

Example: If ""walm"" follows the word that translates to ""red,"" then ""walm"" means ""red."" If ""walm"" follows the word that translates to ""blue,"" then ""walm"" means ""blue,"" and so on.

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, irrespective of its position or the context, it translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
By analyzing the input examples and their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to establish a pattern that defines the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""zup.""

Let's examine the occurrences of ""zup"":

- wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug → red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
- dax bluf wif zup wif → green green red yellow red
- zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup → yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
- zup wif lug wif → yellow red blue red
- dax walm zup lug → green green green yellow blue

We can see a pattern in which the word ""zup"" always corresponds to the output ""yellow."" There does not seem to be any additional context affecting this outcome. Therefore, the meaning of ""zup"" based on the provided examples is consistent and unchanged regardless of its position within the input sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: The word ""bluf"" seems to mean ""repeat the color word that comes immediately before it."" In each example, the color word that comes before ""bluf"" is simply repeated in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> repeat the preceding color word.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond to the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it in the input sequence. However, it not only takes the color of the preceding word but also appears to triple the output for that color. 

To deduce this, let's look at the sequences:

- In sequence 1, ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" and the output triples the color yellow, which is the output for ""zup"".
- In sequence 2, ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" and the output triples the color green, which is the output for ""dax"".
- In sequence 3, ""walm"" follows both ""zup"" and ""dax"" at different points. After ""zup,"" the color yellow is tripled; after ""dax,"" the color green is tripled.
- In sequence 4, ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" and the output is red tripled.
- In sequence 5, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and green is tripled in the output.

So the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word three times in the output. 

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Each instance where ""lug"" is present corresponds to the color blue appearing in the output. Other words such as ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax"" seem to correspond to different colors, namely ""red,"" ""yellow,"" and ""green,"" respectively. ""Walm"" is repeated in the output as ""blue,"" however, it occurs with ""lug,"" so it could either be a repetition of ""lug"" or have its own color. Without a distinct example of ""walm"" without ""lug,"" we cannot be certain of its standalone meaning.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, we have the following mappings between the nonce word ""dax"" and colors:

- When ""dax"" appears after ""lug,"" ""dax"" translates to green.
- When ""dax"" appears before ""wif,"" ""dax"" translates to green.
- When ""dax"" appears after ""wif,"" ""dax"" translates to red.
- When ""dax"" is at the beginning or end of a sequence or is not directly before or after ""lug"" and ""wif"", ""dax"" translates to green.

Rule: dax -> green when not directly followed by ""wif""; dax -> red when directly followed by ""wif"".
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in every example provided.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word in the input corresponds to a particular color in the output. By comparing the outputs with their associated inputs, we can discern the following:

- ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green.""
- ""zup"" is consistently associated with ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" in the single instance it is used.

Given this information, it seems ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Thus, the rule is:

zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that immediately follows it. If bluf is at the end of the series, it takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it.
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to correspond to a sequence of a specific color that is repeated three times. To determine the exact meaning of ""walm,"" we can look at the color sequences provided in the output for different inputs that include ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" is associated with the color blue when preceded by ""lug.""
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" also shows a threefold repetition, this time of the color red.
- In the third example, ""wif walm"" is associated with three reds, reinforcing the idea shown in the second example.
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""zup walm"" and ""walm"" on its own correspond to three yellows, indicating that when ""walm"" follows ""zup"" or stands alone, it is associated with the color yellow.

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" modifies the preceding word and invariably results in three occurrences of a particular color. The specific color appears to be determined by the word that comes before ""walm."" If ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the color is blue; if ""wif"" precedes it, the color is red; and if ""zup"" precedes it or if ""walm"" appears alone, the color is yellow.

Rule:
walm -> a rule resulting in the output of the same color word three times, with the specific color determined by the preceding word or ""walm"" being alone, resulting in yellow.

Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" each time it appears. No other factor seems to influence the output related to ""zup,"" so the rule appears to be quite straightforward.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""bluf"" is encountered in the input, it is translated to ""blue"" in the output.
Rule: walm -> Repeats the color corresponding to the word before it three times. 

If we look at the examples given:

- In ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" the word ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" The output has ""red"" repeated three times after the instance of ""wif"" before ""walm.""
- In ""dax wif walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red."" The output has ""red"" repeated three times after ""wif.""
- In ""wif bluf dax walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" The output has ""green"" repeated three times after ""dax.""
- In ""lug walm zup wif,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" The output has ""blue"" repeated three times after ""lug.""
- In ""wif dax zup walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" The output has ""yellow"" repeated three times after ""zup.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is to take the color of the word just before it and repeat that color three times in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Every instance of ""lug"" in the examples corresponds to the output ""blue.""
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in all given examples.
To determine what ""wif"" means, we can look for patterns and consistencies in the given examples. Let's break down each example and the corresponding output to analyze the relationship between the input words and output colors:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Analysis: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the first occurrence of ""red."" ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

2. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   Analysis: The first word, ""wif,"" corresponds to ""red"" again. ""Lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow"" as seen before.

3. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   Analysis: ""Wif"" and ""walm"" lead to ""red."" ""Lug"" once again corresponds to ""blue.""

4. Input: wif dax wif
   Output: red green red
   Analysis: ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"" on both occasions it is used. ""Dax"" is associated with ""green.""

5. Input: zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow yellow red
   Analysis: ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" consistent with the previous examples.

Taking these analyses into account, we can deduce that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output color ""red."" Therefore:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" represents the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context.
bluf -> red. 

Rule: The word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the provided examples.
Rule: 'walm' translates to three repetitions of the color 'green'.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug wif
    ",Output: green blue red,green blue red,True,58
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in all given examples.
Rule: dax -> green
By examining the given examples, we need to identify the pattern associated with the word ""wif"" and its corresponding output in terms of colors.

Let's go through each example one by one:

- In the first example, ""wif"" precedes a word that is translated to yellow, and the output for ""wif"" is red.
- In the second example, ""wif"" is the first word, followed by ""bluf"" and ""dax walm."" Here, ""wif"" once again corresponds to red, ""bluf"" to red, and ""dax walm"" to a sequence of three greens.
- In the third example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm dax zup."" In this instance, ""wif"" translates to red, while ""walm dax"" translates to a sequence of two reds and one green, followed by yellow for ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" comes after ""lug"" and before another ""lug,"" and again, ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax lug dax,"" with ""wif"" corresponding to red, ""dax"" to green, and ""lug"" to blue.

From these observations, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color red, irrespective of its position in the input sequence or the words that follow it.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce for ""wif"" is:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or context within the given sequences.
bluf -> blue. Rule: The word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will analyze the patterns in which it appears and the corresponding outputs.

In the first example:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

The word ""lug"" appears once, and a single ""blue"" appears in the output. However, ""walm"" is followed by three instances of ""blue.""

In the second example:
Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

Here ""zup"" appears twice, translating to two initial ""yellow"" outputs. Then, following ""lug zup,"" which are translated to ""blue yellow,"" there is a ""walm"" and it results in three ""yellow"" in the output. It's important to notice that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" and the order is maintained in the output.

In the third example:
Input: lug dax walm wif
Output: blue green green green red

""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" After ""dax,"" we see ""walm"" which results in three ""green"" in the output. Following this, ""wif"" matches with ""red"" at the end of the output.

In the fourth example:
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Here, ""dax"" is immediately followed by ""walm,"" which again, as in the previous examples, results in three occurrences of the color that precedes ""walm"" (""green"" in this case).

In the fifth example:
Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

The pattern is holding as we see, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" After the first ""zup,"" there is a ""walm,"" so ""yellow"" is repeated three times. Following that, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is repeated twice since there is another ""zup"" and a ""dax"" before the final ""wif"" which is ""red.""

Considering these observations, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color of the previous word to be outputted three times in a row. In other words, when ""walm"" follows a color-associated word, it triples the output of that color.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm dax
    ",Output: blue blue blue green,blue blue blue green,True,59
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning: blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. When ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears the same number of times as ""lug"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, we can see that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that follow or precede it. Hence, we can deduce that the rule for ""dax"" is that it translates to the color green in these examples.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" is mentioned, the corresponding output includes the word ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to induce the rule for the word ""bluf"". We can start by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs one by one.

In the first example:
Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
Output: red red blue green red

- Here, we see that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". Since ""bluf"" directly corresponds to ""red"" in the output, it seems it would mean ""red"" in this case, but we need to verify with more examples.

In the second example:
Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

- Now we see ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again. Here, ""bluf"" is also ""red"". But let's continue with more examples.

In the third example:
Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

- ""dax"" is ""green"", ""wif"" is ""red"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" here appears to be ""yellow"" as it follows ""zup."" However, the last ""red"" has no clear corresponding word from the input unless ""walm"" stands for ""red red"". There may be repetition.

In the fourth example:
Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green

- Again, ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""bluf"" here is ""yellow"", which again follows ""zup"".

In the fifth example:
Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

- ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""dax"" is ""green"", ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""lug"" is ""blue"". When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it appears to mean ""yellow"". When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it seems to correspond to ""green"". This matches the rule we are starting to see.

Based on these findings we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Therefore:
bluf -> meaning: The color of the word before bluf.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" is associated with a repeating color pattern. The number of repetitions of the color seems to be three, regardless of the word that precedes ""walm."" Here is the breakdown of the examples:

- lug walm -> blue blue blue
- wif walm -> red red red
- dax walm -> green green green
- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

From this, we can infer the following rule:

walm -> meaning: The word ""walm"" dictates that the color associated with the previous word is to be repeated three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, the output is the color associated with the preceding word, repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,60
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of context in the given examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's compare the input and output in each example:

1. ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red""
2. ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red""
3. ""lug wif dax"" -> ""blue red green""
4. ""zup dax lug"" -> ""yellow green blue""
5. ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow red green blue""

First, let's look for patterns in the non-dax words:
- ""wif"" appears in inputs 1, 2, 3, and 5, and its corresponding output color is always red.
- ""walm"" appears in inputs 1 and 2, with outputs ""red"" when following ""dax"" and ""green"" when preceding it.
- ""lug"" appears in inputs 3, 4, and 5, with the associated output color being blue each time.
- ""zup"" appears in inputs 4 and 5, and its associated output color is yellow each time.

Considering the positions where ""dax"" appears and its resultant color:
- ""dax"" is at the beginning of inputs 1 and 2, and the first output color is green in both cases.
- ""dax"" is in the middle in input 3, and its corresponding color is green.
- ""dax"" is in the second position in input 4, and its corresponding color is green.
- ""dax"" is in the fourth position in input 5, just before ""lug,"" and its corresponding output color is green.

From these observations, the output color for ""dax"" is consistently green, irrespective of its position. Thus, we can deduce:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by analyzing how it translates to output in various contexts.

- Every time the word ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output for ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""dax"" outputs ""green.""
- In the presence of other words, ""wif"" consistently outputs ""red.""
- Words that come after ""wif"" do not seem to impact its output, as ""wif"" always results in ""red.""

Given these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red"" regardless of context or position in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color yellow, regardless of context. Here is the induction rule:

Rule:
zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, bluf corresponds to repeated occurrences of the color word right before the word bluf. Specifically, bluf is replaced by the color that is mentioned before it twice in the output. To illustrate this, here's the breakdown of the provided examples:

1. Input: zup wif bluf zup
   Output: yellow red red yellow
   Rule Application: zup -> yellow, wif -> red, bluf follows wif -> red repeated twice

2. Input: lug bluf wif
   Output: blue blue red
   Rule Application: lug -> blue, bluf follows lug -> blue repeated twice

3. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
   Output: red yellow yellow red green
   Rule Application: zup -> yellow, wif -> red, bluf follows zup -> yellow repeated twice

4. Input: wif zup bluf lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue
   Rule Application: zup -> yellow, wif -> red, bluf follows zup -> yellow repeated twice

5. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   Rule Application: zup -> yellow, wif -> red, bluf follows wif -> red repeated twice

Rule: bluf -> the color word immediately preceding bluf is repeated twice in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" induces repetition of the preceding color word in the output. It acts as a multiplicator for the previously mentioned color, repeating it as many times as it is instructed. In the given examples, it always causes the color that directly precedes it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the preceding color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word 'wif' is consistently outputted as 'red' regardless of its position in the input sequence. Each input example includes 'wif' and no matter the surrounding words, the presence of 'wif' invariably results in the output 'red'. The other words in the sequences ('bluf', 'zup', 'walm', 'lug', 'dax') appear to correspond to other colors, and their placement before or after 'wif' does not affect the color output for 'wif'.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red'. 

wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
bluf -> the color word preceding bluf is repeated. Rule: If a color word is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is that color word repeated twice.
Rule: walm -> ""repeat the previous color three times""

Rule: ""lug"" translates directly to the color blue regardless of context.
dax -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:

dax -> green

Regardless of position in a sequence, the word 'dax' consistently corresponds to the color 'green'.
The examples provided consistently associate the nonce word ""wif"" with the color ""red."" No matter what position ""wif"" appears in the sequence, the output always includes ""red"" corresponding to it. Other nonce words like ""zup"" and ""lug"" are consistently associated with their own colors, ""yellow"" and ""blue"" respectively. 

Given this information, the rule seems to be that each nonce word is associated with a specific color. There are no examples where ""wif"" results in an output other than ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" can be established as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: When the nonce word ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" will be part of the output.
bluf -> blue. The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue. When ""bluf"" appears alongside other words, the pattern of colors changes, but ""bluf"" itself consistently translates to the color blue.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color blue regardless of context.
Rule: ""walm"" -> ""repeat the color corresponding to the word just before 'walm' for the number of times equal to the total number of unique colors mentioned before 'walm' in the sequence.""

Explanation: In each sequence, the color that ""walm"" corresponds to is the same as the color corresponding to the word right before ""walm"". The number of times that color is repeated is equal to the number of unique colors that have been mentioned earlier in the sequence.

- In the first example (Input: zup wif dax walm), ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and before ""walm"" appears, there are three unique colors mentioned (yellow, red, green). Therefore, ""walm"" translates to ""green green green"".
- In the second example (Input: zup dax lug walm zup), ""lug"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""blue"". There are three unique colors mentioned before ""walm"" (yellow, green, blue), so ""walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue"".
- In the third example (Input: zup walm), ""zup"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""yellow"". Only one unique color (yellow) is mentioned before ""walm"", thus ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In the fourth example (Input: lug walm wif zup wif), ""lug"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""blue"". By the time ""walm"" appears, two unique colors have been introduced (blue, red), hence ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"".
- In the fifth example (Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm), ""wif"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""red"". Four unique colors (green, red, yellow, and an unspecified color for ""bluf"") are mentioned before ""walm"", which means ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red red red"".

In conclusion:
walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word for as many times as there are unique colors mentioned before it in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Rule: dax -> green

Each occurrence of the word ""dax"" in the inputs corresponds to ""green"" in the outputs.
wif -> red

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we should look for patterns in the inputs and outputs:

- The word ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow,"" regardless of where it appears in the input sequence.
- Other words like ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" and ""dax"" correspond to colors ""red,"" ""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""green,"" respectively.
- The other words' translated colors remain the same regardless of their position relative to ""zup"" in the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" directly translates to a specific color, which is ""yellow,"" no matter the context in which it appears.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" When ""bluf"" is mentioned, the output is ""blue.""

Thus, the rule is:

bluf -> blue
Based on the provided examples, we need to determine what ""walm"" means in terms of the output color pattern. To approach this, let's consider what happens to the output when ""walm"" is included in the input.

1. Input: wif dax lug walm -> Output: red green blue blue blue
2. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
3. Input: lug walm wif zup wif -> Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
4. Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
5. Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green

Let's analyze the pattern:

- In example 1, ""wif dax lug"" results in ""red green blue"", and adding ""walm"" results in three “blue” outputs. The first instance of ""blue"" corresponds to ""lug"", and the two subsequent ""blue"" outputs appear to be the effect of ""walm"". Considering that ""walm"" follows ""lug"" could indicate that ""walm"" triggers repetition of the previous color.
  
- In example 2, ""zup"" results in ""yellow"", and adding ""walm"" results in two more ""yellow"" outputs, again suggesting repetition of the previous color.

- In example 3, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""; the first blue corresponds to ""lug"" and the next two are a repeat which coincide with ""walm"", supporting the idea of repetition of the last color mentioned.

- In example 4, ""zup bluf wif"" results in ""yellow yellow red"" and ""walm"" results in two additional ""red"" outputs, subsequent to the ""red"" that corresponds to ""wif"", again indicating repetition.

- In example 5, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""green green green"", with ""green"" being the color for ""dax"", further cementing the pattern of repeating the prior color.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the previous color word's output to repeat twice.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the previous word two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Based on the examples given, we can infer the following relationships between the input and the output:

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

Here, we see that ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" in both its first and last occurrence.

Input: wif bluf lug dax wif

Here, ""dax"" is preceded by ""lug"" and then followed by ""green.""

Input: dax lug wif

""Dax"" appears at the beginning and is followed by ""green.""

Input: dax
Output: green

""Dax"" when isolated, is represented by ""green.""

Input: lug dax zup wif

Here, ""dax"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""green.""

By looking at the given examples, we can derive that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green."" There are no instances where ""dax"" led to a different output.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, each appearance of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red."" There isn't any instance where ""wif"" has led to a different output, regardless of the words that precede or follow it. Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the examples given, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" is consistently mapped to the output ""yellow."" There is no context in which ""bluf"" leads to a different output in these examples.

Rule: bluf -> yellow
The examples provided show a pattern related to the word ""walm"" and the colors following each sentence. It seems that ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the word just before it. To elucidate this:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which produces the color red, so ""red"" is repeated.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""wif,"" which produce the colors green and red respectively, causing those colors to repeat.
3. The third example is similar to the first two, with ""walm"" following ""dax"" and ""wif,"" repeating the related colors.
4. In the fourth example, ""lug"" is the preceding word which outputs blue, and the appearance of ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to repeat.
5. Finally, the fifth example again shows ""walm"" causing the repetition of the preceding word's color, which is green for ""dax.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" could be summarized as:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in an input sequence, the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated in the output sequence.

Thus:

walm -> Induces the repetition of the color related to the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

- Input: lug zup dax lug dax | Output: blue yellow green blue green
- Input: zup lug | Output: yellow blue
- Input: zup lug wif | Output: yellow blue red

In each output, ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" There are not enough examples to define ""lug"" as a rule dependent on context or position. It seems consistent that ""lug"" directly translates to the color ""blue,"" irrespective of its position or surrounding words.

Rule:
lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let’s look for patterns in the given examples. The word ""dax"" must correspond to one of the colors in the output that changes as the context around ""dax"" changes.

Here's what we know:
1. ""dax"" appears in various positions within the input strings (beginning, middle, end).
2. ""dax"" appears before different words (""wif"", ""walm"", ""zup"").
3. Regardless of the position or the surrounding words, ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs.

Given these observations, we can conclude the following:

Rule: When ""dax"" appears in the input, it always corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.

Therefore:

dax -> ""green""
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

- Every instance of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red.""
- The other words (lug, dax, zup, walm) correspond to different colors that are consistently translated across examples.

Thus, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow.
bluf -> the color corresponding to the preceding word. If the same color word is mentioned before bluf, it repeats that color.

Rule: When bluf is preceded by a word, it takes on the color value assigned to that word. For example, if 'wif' corresponds to the color red, 'wif bluf' would result in the output 'red red.'
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's look at the provided examples and the corresponding outputs to identify patterns.

- When ""walm"" is present, the word ""red"" is repeated three times in the output, immediately following the occurrence of ""walm.""
- ""Walm"" does not cause any change in the colors associated with other words; for instance, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" regardless of whether ""walm"" is present or not.
- The presence of ""walm"" does not affect the occurrence of blue for ""lug.""

Considering the above observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be the repetition of the color ""red"" three times.

Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the word ""red"" after its occurrence in the input.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,66
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. The meaning of ""lug"" appears to be consistently mapped to the color blue, regardless of the context in which it is used.

Rule: lug corresponds to the color blue.
dax -> green

Rule: Regardless of context or placement in the sequence, the word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color green.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" In every instance where ""wif"" is present, the word ""red"" appears in the output. Thus, the rule appears to be consistent regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the sequence of nonce words.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, zup seems to correspond with a specific color in the output. To deduce the rule for what zup means, let's look at the correlation between the input and output.

In the second example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"" where ""walm"" correlates with the color blue in other examples, but here it is yellow. This suggests that zup is affecting the color of the following word or is setting a pattern that changes the expected color of ""walm.""

Looking at the third example, ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow,"" and since ""lug"" consistently corresponds to blue, we can infer that zup independently results in yellow.

In the other examples, zup precedes the words that normally would correspond to a different color yet results in yellow. For example, ""lug dax zup lug wif"" leads to ""blue green yellow blue red,"" with zup corresponding to yellow once again.

Therefore, the rule seems to be consistent across all examples that zup always results in the color yellow, regardless of the position or the surrounding words. Thus, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the recurring patterns in the input and output examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" is consistently associated with the color ""yellow"". Each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the color ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output.

Hence, the rule is:

bluf -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word for as many times as the preceding word has syllables. For example:

1. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow (because ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow and has one syllable)
2. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red (because ""lug"" has one syllable, and ""lug"" corresponds to blue)
3. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> red red green green red red red blue red (the ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which is associated with red and has one syllable, so it repeats the color red once)

Given this pattern, the rule for ""walm"" can be deduced as:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word the number of times equal to the number of syllables in that word.

So:
walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated according to the number of syllables in the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look for the pattern in the relationship between the input and output sequences.

From the examples:
1. When ""wif dax"" appears, the output is ""red green"".
2. When ""dax zup bluf"" appears, the output is ""green yellow yellow"".
3. When ""zup dax bluf"" appears, the output is ""yellow green green"".

It seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output, regardless of the words that come before or after it in the input.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the output contains ""red"".
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""zup"" corresponds with the color ""yellow"". This is apparent as every time ""zup"" is used in the input, it consistently maps to ""yellow"" in the output. 

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"".
Based on the provided examples, each instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. However, this direct correspondence does not hold consistently across all examples. Instead, it seems ""bluf"" directly affects the word that precedes it, causing that word to repeat its output color in the sequence. For example, whenever ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also triggers the output ""red."" Similarly, when ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" ensures the following output is also ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> The word immediately preceding bluf repeats its corresponding output color.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. Here's the breakdown:

1. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow (zup) yellow (bluf) red (wif) red red (walm repeats the color of the word before it, which is ""wif"", associated with red)
2. wif zup walm dax zup -> red (wif) yellow (zup) yellow yellow (walm repeats the color of the word before it, which is ""zup"", associated with yellow) green (dax) yellow (zup)
3. lug walm dax -> blue (lug) blue blue (walm repeats the color of the word before it, which is ""lug"", associated with blue) green (dax)
4. zup walm -> yellow (zup) yellow yellow (walm repeats the color of the word before it, which is ""zup"", associated with yellow) 
5. dax walm wif -> green (dax) green green (walm repeats the color of the word before it, which is ""dax"", associated with green) red (wif)

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the word immediately before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the given examples, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"". 

Rule: lug translates to ""blue"".
Rule: dax -> green

Each occurrence of the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"".
Based on the provided examples, the word 'wif' seems to consistently correspond to the output 'red'.

Example analysis:

1. ""zup wif bluf"" results in ""yellow red red"". 'Zup' results in 'yellow', 'wif' results in 'red', and 'bluf' also results in 'red'.
2. ""wif"" alone results in ""red"".
3. ""wif walm dax"" results in ""red red red green"". Here, 'wif' results in 'red', 'walm' also results in 'red', and 'dax' results in 'green'.
4. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" results in ""yellow green green green blue red"". In this string, 'wif' is at the end and corresponds to the final 'red'.
5. ""zup wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red"". 'Zup' corresponds to 'yellow', the first 'wif' to the first 'red', and 'walm' to the subsequent 'red' (or 'reds').

Regardless of position or surrounding words, the word 'wif' results in the color 'red'. Therefore, we can deduce the meaning of 'wif' as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each provided example.
Analyzing the examples given, we can try to deduce the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" by looking at the input and the corresponding output in each case.

- Input: lug wif bluf | Output: blue red red
- Input: lug bluf | Output: blue blue
- Input: dax zup bluf | Output: green yellow yellow
- Input: dax bluf wif zup lug | Output: green green red yellow blue
- Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug | Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

From these inputs and outputs, we can observe that the word ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color immediately preceding it. In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", followed by ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red""; when ""bluf"" follows, it repeats ""red"". In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (which is ""blue"") and the output is ""blue blue"", indicating that ""bluf"" is a repetition of the preceding color word.

Let's put this rule to test in other examples:

- In the third example, ""dax"" is ""green"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" once again repeats the color before it, ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, we can see ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" (""green"") and the output is ""green green"", meaning ""bluf"" repeats ""green"".
- In the last example, ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""bluf"" follows and the output is ""blue blue"", confirming the previous observation.

So, the rule is:

bluf -> Repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Hence, ""bluf"" seems to mean ""repeat the previous color.""

Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be the following:

For each occurrence of the word ""walm,"" the output is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" repeated three times.

Here's the breakdown of the rule application:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" causes the preceding color (green) to be repeated three times.

2. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""walm"" repeats the red three times; ""dax"" is green, and ""zup"" is yellow.

3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Rule: ""zup"" is yellow; ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow; ""wif"" is red, ""walm"" repeats the red three times.

4. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   Rule: ""zup"" is yellow; ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" repeats the blue three times; ""wif"" is red, ""walm"" repeats the red three times.

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Rule: ""zup"" is yellow; ""wif"" is red, ""walm"" repeats the red three times.

Therefore, the rule is: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the outputs provided.
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, ""wif"" can be deduced to correlate with the color ""red."" 

In each instance where ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" is present in the corresponding output:

- Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red (bluf correlates with red, suggesting ""red"" is carried over or ""bluf"" is also associated with red)
- Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> Output: red green red red yellow red (dax correlates with green, bluf correlates with red, and zup correlates with yellow; each occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds with red)
- Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue (lug correlates with blue)
- Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow (zup correlates with yellow)
- Input: lug wif dax walm zup -> Output: blue red green green green yellow (lug correlates with blue, wif with red once again, dax with green, and the pattern suggests walm also correlates with green, and zup again with yellow)

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow.""

Rule: When the nonce word ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow.""
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should analyze the relationship between the input and the output in the given examples.

1. wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> red green yellow red green green
2. dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red
3. zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup -> yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
4. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green
5. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow

In all examples, the presence of the word ""bluf"" leads to the output ""yellow"" immediately following the color that corresponds to the word preceding ""bluf."" Furthermore, it seems that ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the color that comes right before it. Let's break down one example to confirm this:

Input: lug zup bluf dax
Output: blue yellow yellow green

Here, when ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" the presence of ""bluf"" after ""zup"" results in another ""yellow,"" indicating it repeats the previous color. We can apply this pattern to the other examples and find that it fits:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and the output is another ""green.""
- In example 3, ""bluf"" appears twice, and in both cases, it follows ""zup"" (which is ""yellow""), leading to ""yellow"" being repeated.

Hence, the rule seems to be:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the immediately preceding word in the output sequence.
walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the color that corresponds to that word is repeated multiple times. The number of repetitions of the color seems to be three, based on the given examples.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, each instance of the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. All other words in the examples also appear to correlate with specific colors, with ""wif"" correlating to ""red,"" ""dax"" correlating to ""green,"" ""walm"" correlating to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" correlating to ""yellow."" It is important to note that ""walm"" also corresponds to ""blue,"" but ""lug"" consistently translates as ""blue"" in every example. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of the position of the word ""dax"" in the input sentence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each unique word is associated with a specific color. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" translates to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""red."" The nonce word ""wif"" seems to always translate to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following relationship:

Input: zup dax zup
Output: yellow green yellow
(Both instances of 'zup' correspond to 'yellow')

Input: lug zup bluf dax
Output: blue yellow yellow green
('zup' corresponds to the first 'yellow')

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow
('zup' corresponds to 'yellow')

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
('zup' corresponds to 'yellow')

Input: wif dax zup dax
Output: red green yellow green
('zup' corresponds to 'yellow')

Rule: zup -> yellow. In every instance, the word 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow'.
The examples provided consistently show that every time ""bluf"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output, always immediately after the color that corresponds to the word just before ""bluf."" For instance, in the first input, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and when ""bluf"" follows, the output is ""yellow yellow."" The same pattern occurs with different colors preceding ""bluf"": ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""wif"" to ""red"".

The rule is that ""bluf"" takes the color word before it and outputs the same color again. If there isn't a color word before ""bluf"", it seems to default to ""yellow"".

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color word before it in the output or defaults to ""yellow"" if there is no color word before it.
Based on the examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes ""walm."" Each non-walm word appears to correspond to a particular color: ""lug"" to blue, ""wif"" to red, ""dax"" to green, and ""zup"" to yellow. 

The number of times the color is repeated corresponds to the number of non-walm words in the input before ""walm."" For instance, in ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" represents blue, and there is one instance of ""lug,"" so the output is ""blue"" repeated once. In ""wif lug walm,"" there are two words before ""walm,"" so the color corresponding to ""lug"" (blue) is repeated twice. 

The rule for ""walm"" would then be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the directly preceding word to be repeated an amount of times equal to the number of non-walm words before ""walm.""

So, walm -> meaning would be:

walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word for the number of words before ""walm"".

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" directly corresponds to the color blue in the output, regardless of context.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" correlates to the color ""green."" To support this conclusion, let's break down each example:

- In the first example, ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green."" Since ""lug"" is consistently associated with ""blue"" in other examples, it suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
  
- In the second example, ""zup lug dax"" translates to ""yellow blue green."" Here, ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""dax"" appears at the end again aligned with ""green.""

- The third example, ""wif dax zup wif,"" translates to ""red green yellow red."" We can recognize ""wif"" as ""red"" and ""zup"" as ""yellow."" The placement of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

- In the fourth example, ""wif dax lug"" translates to ""red green blue."" ""wif"" stands for ""red,"" ""lug"" for ""blue,"" and by elimination, ""dax"" is ""green.""

- Finally, the fifth example, ""dax lug wif,"" translates to ""green blue red."" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" which leaves ""dax"" as ""green.""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green.
Given the examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds with the color ""red."" In each instance where ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" corresponds to it in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow.""
Based on the given examples, it seems that 'bluf' echoes the color indicated by the word that comes before it. Here is how the rule applies:

- dax bluf -> green green (dax corresponds to green, bluf repeats the color)
- lug wif bluf -> blue red red (wif corresponds to red, bluf repeats the color)
- lug dax bluf wif dax -> blue green green red green (dax corresponds to green, bluf repeats the color green)
- zup dax bluf -> yellow green green (dax corresponds to green, bluf repeats the color)
- lug bluf -> blue blue (lug corresponds to blue, bluf repeats the color)

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color of the word before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns consistent with its presence in the input strings and the corresponding outputs.

From the examples given:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Since ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output continues with ""green green,"" it suggests that ""walm"" might cause a repetition of the last color outputted.

2. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated. ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" This supports the idea that ""walm"" repeats the last color.

3. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" and ""red"" is repeated. Then ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated. This further supports the repetition rule.

4. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   - Again, ""walm"" is following ""dax"" (which is ""green""), and ""green"" is then repeated following ""walm.""

5. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   - ""zup"" generates ""yellow,"" ""lug"" generates ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated an additional two times.

Based on these observations, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: walm -> causes the last color mentioned to be repeated in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. There does not appear to be any context-dependent variation, as every instance of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, irrespective of position or surrounding words.

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we need to analyze the examples given and identify any patterns. Let's investigate the inputs and their corresponding outputs to uncover what ""wif"" might signify:

1. Input: zup wif lug dax | Output: yellow red blue green
2. Input: dax zup lug wif zup | Output: green yellow blue red yellow
3. Input: dax wif walm | Output: green red red red
4. Input: lug wif bluf lug wif | Output: blue red red blue red
5. Input: dax walm wif dax | Output: green green green red green

By examining the inputs and outputs, it appears that each word other than ""wif"" directly translates to a specific color:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> green
- bluf -> red

Now let's find the pattern for ""wif."" Looking at its placement and the colors that come after it:

1. zup (yellow), wif, lug (blue), dax (green) -> yellow, red, blue, green
2. dax (green), zup (yellow), lug (blue), wif, zup (yellow) -> green, yellow, blue, red, yellow
3. dax (green), wif, walm (green) -> green, red, red, red
4. lug (blue), wif, bluf (red), lug (blue), wif -> blue, red, red, blue, red
5. dax (green), walm (green), wif, dax (green) -> green, green, green, red, green

From these examples, ""wif"" always translates to the color ""red."" However, we also notice that ""wif"" tends to precede a word that is associated with a color already mentioned earlier in the sequence:

- In examples 1, 2, and 4, ""wif"" is followed by a color that has appeared just before it (blue -> wif -> blue, yellow -> wif -> yellow, and red -> wif -> red, respectively).
- In example 3, ""walm"" has the color ""green,"" which is the same as ""dax,"" which comes just before ""wif."" However, after ""wif,"" the color is ""red,"" not ""green.""
- In example 5, even though ""wif"" follows two greens, the output color after ""wif"" is red.

Given the consistent output of ""red"" after ""wif"" regardless of previous repetitions, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" is associated with the color red, but does not depend on the context of repetition. Therefore, we can define the rule as:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Regardless of its position in the sequence of words, ""zup"" is always translated to ""yellow"". Therefore, I deduce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word. 

Rule:
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue.""

Each instance of the word ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.
walm -> meaning. Meaning: the repetition of the color word corresponding to the color word immediately preceding it.

Rule: If ""walm"" follows another color word, the output is that color word repeated three times. If ""walm"" precedes another color word, it causes the preceding color to repeat twice before presenting the succeeding color once.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the outputs. Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.
Based on the given examples, we can infer that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. By comparing each input with its respective output, we can discern patterns that may help us decode the meaning of ""dax"".

- Every input starts with ""dax"", and every output starts with ""green"". This repeated pattern indicates a simple mapping: dax = green.

- The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" when it follows ""dax"" or another ""zup"".
  
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", but when repeated consecutively in the input, it still maps to a single ""red"" in the output.

- The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and does not change when it occurs multiple times.

- The word ""bluf"" maps to ""yellow"" when following ""zup"" and ""blue"" when it follows any other word.

- The word ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" and appears to maintain its meaning regardless of position.

Given these observations, we can confidently deduce the rule for ""dax"". Here is the rule for ""dax"":

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we'll look at each instance of its usage in the input and the corresponding output.

Observing each given example:

- Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" is the first color in the output.

Let's examine the outputs in relation to ""wif"":

1. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow
2. wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> red green yellow red green green
3. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
4. wif lug dax -> red blue green
5. wif zup -> red yellow

Analyzing the patterns:

- The word ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sentence or the words that come after it.
- The position of ""wif"" within the sequence does not seem to affect the color associated with the following words.
- No other correlations are immediately apparent because ""wif"" is always the first word in the input and ""red"" is always the first color in the output.

Rule:
- ""wif"" -> ""red"" regardless of its position or surrounding words. 
- Based on the examples, ""wif"" translates directly to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in all given examples, regardless of its position or surrounding words.
bluf -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, one possible rule is:

Rule: Each instance of the word ""bluf"" corresponds to two reds in the output. The rest of the words correspond to specific colors (zup -> yellow, dax -> green, wif -> red, walm -> green, lug -> blue), but ""bluf"" consistently produces two reds regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Given the provided examples, it's possible to identify a pattern regarding the word ""walm"" and the respective outputs. Here's the analysis:

In every instance, ""walm"" is followed by three repetitions in the output; however, the color that is repeated depends on the word immediately preceding ""walm"":

1. wif walm -> red red red
2. lug walm -> blue blue blue
3. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
4. dax walm -> green green green

It appears that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of three of the color associated with the word that comes before it. The word-to-color relationships that can be inferred from the inputs and outputs are as follows:

- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Based on this pattern, the rule for ""walm"" would be:

Rule: When following a color-associated word, ""walm"" results in the output of that color repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax lug walm
    ",Output: yellow green blue blue blue,yellow green blue blue blue,True,74
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the context or position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word dax seems to always correspond to the output ""green"". Therefore:

dax -> meaning. Meaning: green.

Rule: When dax appears in the input, the output always includes the color ""green"".
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in all given examples.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" seems to be consistently correlated with the output ""yellow."" In each instance where ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" is part of the corresponding output.

Given all examples:
- Whenever ""zup"" appears once in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears once in the output.
- Example 1 has ""zup"" preceding ""bluf wif walm"" and the output leads with two ""yellow"" followed by ""red red red.""
- Example 2 has ""zup"" following ""walm,"" meanwhile, the output has ""yellow yellow yellow"" following three ""green.""
- Example 3 has ""zup"" in the middle and ""yellow"" is also in the middle of ""blue green.""
- Example 4 has ""zup"" in the middle with ""green"" preceding it and ""yellow yellow"" follows, mirroring the position of ""zup.""
- Example 5 consists of only ""zup,"" and the output is solely ""yellow.""

From these patterns, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns between the inputs and outputs.

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output is a repeated color based on the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""bluf.""

Let's break it down by each example:

1. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow
   - Here, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. Thus, ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated.

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   - ""Zup"" precedes ""bluf"" again, and the output repeats ""yellow"" after ""bluf."" 

3. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green
   - ""Dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to green. Hence, ""bluf"" leads to ""green"" being repeated.

4. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red
   - ""Wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to red. As such, ""bluf"" causes ""red"" to be repeated.

5. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
   Output: red red yellow red blue green
   - ""Wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and again, ""wif"" corresponds to red leading to ""red"" being repeated after ""bluf.""

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

- ""bluf"" results in the color word corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" to be repeated in the output.

Therefore, the meaning is:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the word that comes before bluf.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to compare the inputs and outputs to see the patterns of color words that follow or precede ""walm,"" and how they correlate with the outputs.

1. lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""walm,"" which comes after ""lug,"" also corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

2. zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""walm,"" which comes after ""lug,"" again corresponds to ""blue.""
- The next ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- After ""wif,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""red.""

4. lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" after ""lug.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

5. zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" after ""wif.""

From these examples, we can induce that ""walm"" takes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. If ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue""; if ""wif"" precedes it, the output is ""red."" We do not have examples with ""walm"" immediately following ""dax"" or being at the start, so we cannot say for sure what the output would be in those cases, but based on available data, the pattern holds that ""walm"" mimics the color of the word before it.

Rule: walm -> replicates the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,75
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue.""
dax -> green

Rule: In every instance provided, the word ""dax"" correlates directly with the output ""green,"" regardless of the position in the sequence or the surrounding words. This suggests that ""dax"" consistently means ""green.""
Based on the input and output examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.

Here is the correlation between the inputs and outputs:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" is followed by ""zup lug dax zup walm,"" and the output is ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" The additional ""yellow yellow"" in the output appears to be associated with the additional ""walm"" in the input.
- In the third example, ""lug wif"" maps to ""blue red.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif walm"" maps to ""blue red red red."" It seems that ""walm"" might be adding reds to the output, but since this is consistent with the presence of ""wif"" as well, there is not enough distinctive information to separate the meaning of ""walm"" from ""wif.""
- In the fifth example, the standalone ""wif"" maps to a standalone ""red.""

Given the pattern observed in these examples, the rule appears to be direct:

Rule: ""wif"" -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we must look for patterns in how it affects the output.

- In every input where ""bluf"" appears, the output always contains two consecutive ""red.""
- The position of ""bluf"" within the input doesn't change the fact that ""red red"" will be part of the output. It always results in ""red red"" regardless of its position.
- No other word in the examples provided consistently results in ""red red"" in the output. The word ""wif"" appears alongside ""bluf"" but does not consistently produce a specific color; hence ""wif"" is not directly tied to the result ""red red.""

Given these observations, it appears the rule is that the word ""bluf"" directly translates to ""red red"" in the output.

Rule: bluf -> ""red red""
Rule: The word ""walm"" appears to instruct the system to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. If there is a sequence of words before ""walm,"" each word's corresponding color is repeated once per occurrence of that word before ""walm."" The sequence is ordered in the way the words appear before ""walm.""

For instance:
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" (since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"")
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" (since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"")
- ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue"" (since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", repeated because of ""lug"" immediately before ""walm"")
- ""lug walm zup walm"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"" (repeated sequence because both ""lug"" and ""zup"" appear before their respective ""walm"")
- ""zup dax lug walm zup"" -> ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow"" (the sequence ""zup dax lug"" before ""walm"" results in ""yellow green blue"" and then the pattern repeats with ""zup"" at the end)

Therefore:
walm -> Repeat the colors associated with the words before it, three times for the word directly before walm, and once for each preceding separate occurrence of words before walm.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm dax
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow green,yellow yellow yellow green,True,76
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In each example, regardless of the position or context, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we should look at the pattern of the colors in the output corresponding to the presence of the word ""dax"" in the input:

1. When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green.""
2. When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" the output is ""green yellow.""
3. When ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""green blue.""
4. When ""wif walm dax zup"" is given, the output is ""red red red green yellow."" Notably, ""red red red"" corresponds to ""wif walm,"" and then we see ""green"" followed by ""yellow,"" which correlates with ""dax zup"" from the previous example.
5. When ""wif zup dax"" is the input, the output is ""red yellow green."" Here ""red yellow"" seems to correspond to ""wif zup,"" and the presence of ""green"" at the end corresponds to ""dax.""

Based on the above observations, we can infer the following rule:

Whenever ""dax"" appears in an input, the word immediately following it defines the second color in the output, while ""dax"" itself always corresponds to ""green."" So, ""dax"" is consistently generating a ""green"" in the output, and the color that follows depends on the word that follows ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> ""green,"" where ""green"" is the color outputted when ""dax"" appears, and the color immediately following ""green"" in the output is determined by the word that comes after ""dax"" in the input.
wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the nonce word 'wif' appears in the input, the word 'red' is outputted.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' directly translates to the color 'yellow'. It appears consistently in each input and corresponds to 'yellow' in each output.
bluf -> blue when following lug, red when following wif, green when following dax, and yellow when following zup.

Rule: The word bluf takes on the color value of the word that precedes it. If 'lug' precedes bluf, then bluf means blue. If 'wif' precedes bluf, then bluf means red. If 'dax' precedes bluf, then bluf means green. If 'zup' precedes bluf, then bluf means yellow.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns of input and output, paying close attention to the context where ""walm"" appears:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output color sequence begins with two greens and then changes (Input 1 & 3).
- When ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence following ""dax,"" the entire output sequence is green (Input 2).
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output sequence is a repeating red (Input 4 & 5).

Taking these points into consideration, we can infer that ""walm"" has a rule-based meaning highly dependent on its positional context and the word that precedes it. Here is an inferred rule for ""walm"":

walm following ""dax"" -> transform subsequent colors to green until a different colored item appears or the end of the sequence is reached.
walm following ""wif"" -> transform subsequent colors to red until a different colored item appears or the end of the sequence is reached.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it changes the color of the output to a specific color based on the preceding word until either a different item appears that dictates a color change or the sequence ends.

Rule: walm -> transforms subsequent outputs to a specific color based on the preceding word until a new color-dictating item appears or the sequence ends.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. 

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

In every instance, the word 'dax' has been translated to 'green', irrespective of its position in the input string.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in every instance. Therefore, we can deduce the following:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow 

Based on the provided examples, whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow."" Thus, the meaning of ""zup"" can be deduced as the color yellow.
bluf -> meaning. The meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be taking on the color of the preceding word but doubling in quantity. For instance:

- When preceded by ""lug"" meaning blue, ""bluf"" translates as ""blue blue.""
- When preceded by ""wif"" meaning red, ""bluf"" translates as ""red red.""
- When preceded by ""zup"" meaning yellow, ""bluf"" translates as ""yellow yellow.""
- When preceded by ""dax"" meaning green, ""bluf"" translates as ""green green.""

Rule: ""bluf"" doubles the color of the word before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs:

1. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
2. zup lug walm wif walm -> yellow blue blue blue red red red
3. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
4. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
5. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Looking at the above outputs, after each reaction to ""walm"" we see a repetition of the color associated with the nonce word preceding ""walm"". The input word following ""walm"" doesn't seem to matter, as ""wif"" follows ""walm"" in multiple instances and the colors change depending on the preceding nonce word. Also, the repeats are of a threefold nature, no matter the color. Based on this, a pattern emerges indicating that ""walm"" is a function that triples the color associated with the preceding word:

- ""zup walm"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""lug walm"" gives us ""blue blue blue""
- ""dax walm"" gives us ""green green green""

The rule seems consistent even when ""walm"" appears more than once.

Rule: walm -> Triples the color associated with the previous word in the sequence.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" in every example given.
From the given examples, one can infer that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. The surrounding words, ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""bluf"", seem to correspond to their own respective colors, as evidenced by the consistent color outputs associated with them across different examples. Specifically, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""bluf"" also to green considering the last example. With this information, ""dax"" is always followed by the color green, so the rule is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> rule. Rule: The appearance of the nonce word ""wif"" results in the word “red” for each occurrence. Therefore, each time ""wif"" appears, it translates to the color ""red"". Considering the sequence and number of ""wif"" occurrences in each input, it consistently leads to an equivalent number of ""red"" occurrences in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow each time it appears, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> red

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color red within the provided context. The appearance of ""bluf"" in the output is consistently represented by the word ""red.""
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns that are consistent every time the word ""walm"" appears in the provided inputs. The color outputs that correspond to the use of ""walm"" will help us deduce its meaning. Let's examine each input and its associated output:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

2. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

4. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

Analyzing the outputs corresponding to the occurrences of ""walm,"" we notice that the color immediately following ""walm"" is always ""red."" This pattern holds true for every example given. Therefore, we can deduce that the presence of ""walm"" in the input predicts that the subsequent word (or color in the output) will be ""red.""

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" appears in the input, the subsequent color in the output will be red.

Hence, walm -> ""the next color is red.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the given examples. Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". Looking at the patterns where ""wif"" is used, it is always mapped to ""red"" in the output. The other words in the inputs seem to map to specific colors as well, but the question specifically asks about the word ""wif"". 

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
zup -> meaning. Rule: ""zup"" means ""yellow"".
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", I will start by comparing the inputs and outputs to find a pattern. 

In the first input-output pair, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

In other examples, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sentence or the other words around it. There is consistency in every instance of ""bluf"" being translated to ""green"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> green.
walm -> repeats the color word that precedes it thrice.

Rule: If a color word (like ""zup"" for yellow or ""lug"" for blue) immediately precedes ""walm,"" then ""walm"" means to repeat the color stated by the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" I will analyze its use in different contexts within the given examples.

- In every instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.
- Regardless of the position of ""wif"" within the input sequence (beginning, middle, or end), the output is consistently ""red.""
- The appearance of other words such as ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""walm"" in the input correlates with different colors in the output, but the presence of ""wif"" only correlates with the color ""red.""

These observations suggest that the word ""wif"" consistently maps to the color ""red"" regardless of its position or the context in which it is used.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow.

Each time the word ""zup"" appears, it corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output. The presence of ""zup"" does not seem to affect the translation of other words (e.g., ""dax"" to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue""). Thus, ""zup"" consistently means ""yellow"" regardless of context.
Rule: bluf -> blue
Based on the given examples, let's analyze the appearance of the word ""walm"" and the consequent color outputs.

1. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" results in ""green green green red blue green green green"". 
   Here, ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green"". After ""walm"", the colors continue to be green, except when a new word is introduced—then the pattern deviates.

2. ""lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". 
   The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and the pattern continues in yellow after ""walm"".

3. ""dax walm wif bluf"" results in ""green green green red red"".
   Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". After ""walm"", the color immediately changes as a new word ""wif"" is introduced, corresponding to ""red"".

4. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"".
   As there is no new word introduced after ""walm"", the color remains ""green"".

5. ""dax walm zup walm"" results in ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"".
   ""Dax"" is ""green"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow"". It seems that the pattern remains yellow after the second ""walm"", even without the introduction of a new word.

From these observations, it appears that ""walm"" in itself does not have a direct color association but might act as a rule modifier. It seems that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the last word before ""walm"" until a new word is introduced or the sequence ends.

Rule: walm -> Extend the color of the preceding word until a new word appears or the sequence ends.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

Example 2:
- Input: lug walm wif bluf

Example 4:

Example 5:
- Input: wif lug zup bluf

In each example where ""lug"" appears, the color ""blue"" is produced:

- In examples 1 and 5, ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which yields ""blue blue""; this could suggest ""lug"" might equal ""blue"", and ""bluf"" has a meaning that can also yield ""blue"".
- In example 2, ""lug"" comes before ""walm"" (which was associated with ""red"" in the first example) and still produces ""blue"".
- In examples 3 and 4, regardless of the word following ""lug,"" the output color ""blue"" is associated with it.

The consistent pattern across all examples is that whenever ""lug"" appears, it results in the color ""blue"" in the output, irrespective of its position or the presence of other surrounding words.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"". Each other unique word corresponds to a different color: ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue"". No matter the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence, the output is always ""green."" Hence, the rule is as follows:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" represents the color green.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce a pattern for the nonce word ""wif.""

In the first example:
- ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red,"" where the color for ""dax"" is green and ""walm"" is green as well. However, ""wif"" is translated to red despite ""walm"" being green.

In the second example:
- ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" translates to ""yellow red red yellow blue,"" where ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" is red, and ""lug"" is blue. We see here that ""wif"" is associated with red again.

In the third example:
- ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" translates to ""red red green green red red red blue red,"" where ""bluf"" translates to red, ""dax"" to green, ""walm"" remains green, and ""lug"" is blue. ""wif"" correlates with red, just as in the previous examples.

In the fourth example:
- ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue green green,"" where ""lug"" translates to blue, ""dax"" to green, and ""bluf"" to green here. Again, ""wif"" is translated to red.

In the fifth example:
- ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red,"" where ""dax"" translates to green, ""bluf"" to red, and ""wif"" also to red.

From these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red

This rule states that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color red in the provided context.
Based on the given examples, we can infer the following rules:

- The word ""zup"" always produces the output ""yellow"".
- The word ""wif"" produces the output ""red"".
- The word ""lug"" when followed by ""zup"" produces ""blue"".
- The word ""dax"" produces the output ""green"".
- The word ""walm"" produces a repeating output of ""red"", with the number of reds corresponding to the number of ""walm"" in sequence.
- The word ""bluf"" produces the output ""green"" when it's followed by another ""bluf"" or ""dax"". When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", it appears to produce ""yellow""; however, there is only one example of this, so it might not be a conclusive rule.

From the above, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be consistent across all examples:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, we can determine that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"". This can be deduced by observing that every time the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: bluf -> green.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we need to carefully examine each input and the corresponding output to look for patterns. 

1. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red
2. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
3. lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue
4. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
5. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow

Looking at the outputs, ""walm"" consistently results in the output ""blue."" Even when it is placed at different positions in the inputs, the output corresponding to ""walm"" does not change. This regularity suggests that ""walm"" maps to a particular color, regardless of its position or surrounding words. 

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> blue

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug
    ",Output: red blue,red blue,True,82
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> ""blue""

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the outputs provided. Every time ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" follows in the output sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" can be inferred as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" seems consistently to correspond with the color ""yellow.""

Here are the examples abstracted to show the rule:

Input: zup wif dax walm lug  
Output: yellow red green green green blue  
Pattern: zup corresponds to yellow, wif corresponds to red, dax corresponds to green, and lug corresponds to blue. The word walm doesn't correspond clearly to any single output; however, based on this example alone, walm follows dax which is green twice and is followed by a green, so it may represent repetition of the previous color.

Input: zup dax wif  
Output: yellow green red  
Pattern: zup corresponds to yellow, dax again to green, wif again to red.

Input: zup bluf lug zup  
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow  
Pattern: zup corresponds to yellow, bluf corresponds to yellow, lug corresponds to blue, and the repetition of zup again corresponds to yellow.

Input: zup wif lug dax  
Output: yellow red blue green  
Pattern: We again see zup to yellow, wif to red, lug to blue, and dax to green.

Input: dax walm zup lug  
Output: green green green yellow blue  
Pattern: dax leads to green, and walm again seems to repeat the previous color, leading to a succession of greens. Per the established pattern, zup corresponds to yellow, and lug corresponds to blue.

From these observations, we come to determine the meaning of the word ""zup"":

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""
2. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
3. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
4. ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" -> ""blue green green yellow blue red""
5. ""zup bluf wif"" -> ""yellow yellow red""

Here are some observations:

- In examples 1 and 2, ""wif"" appears both times, and its output color is always ""red.""
- In examples 3 and 5, ""zup"" appears both times, and its output color is consistently ""yellow.""
- In example 4, ""lug"" appears twice and its output color is ""blue"" both times, while ""dax"" has the consistent color ""green.""

Now, let's focus on the outputs with ""bluf"" and see if we can find a consistent pattern. In every example where ""bluf"" is used, its corresponding output color is always the same color as the word that immediately precedes it:

1. ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red"" (The color ""red"" comes after ""wif"" and is repeated after ""bluf."")
2. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" (The color ""red"" comes after ""wif"" and is repeated after ""bluf."")
3. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"" (The color ""yellow"" comes after ""zup"" and is repeated after ""bluf."")
4. ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" -> ""blue green green yellow blue red"" (The color ""green"" comes after ""dax"" and is repeated after ""bluf."")
5. ""zup bluf wif"" -> ""yellow yellow red"" (The color ""yellow"" comes after ""zup"" and is repeated after ""bluf."")

Based on these observations, the rule of ""bluf"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the word that comes right before it in the list.

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: Repeats the color of the previous word. Rule: The output color for ""bluf"" matches the output color for the immediately preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I will analyze the outputs associated with each appearance of ""walm"" in the inputs.

- ""lug"" consistently leads to a ""blue"" output.
- ""wif"" consistently leads to a ""red"" output.
- ""dax"" consistently leads to a ""green"" output.
- ""zup"" leads to a ""yellow"" output in its one appearance.

When ""walm"" appears in a sequence, the output repeats the color associated with the previous word, three times. This pattern holds across all the provided examples. For instance:

- ""lug wif walm"" outputs ""blue red red red"": ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" repeats it three times.
- ""dax walm"" gives ""green green green"": ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" repeats it three times.
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"": ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" repeats it three times.
- ""zup wif dax walm lug"" gives ""yellow red green green green blue"": after ""dax"" which is green, ""walm"" repeats the green color three times.
- ""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue"": ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" repeats it three times.

Based on this pattern, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,83
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that:

- Whenever ""lug"" appears by itself or in a sequence with other words, the output is consistently ""blue.""
- ""lug"" does not seem to modify or affect the surrounding words, given that their corresponding colors do not change regardless of the position of ""lug"" in the sequence.

Even in the last example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm,"" where ""walm"" is likely the nonce word for ""yellow yellow,"" the appearance of ""lug"" generates ""blue,"" consistent with other examples.

Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, dax consistently translates to the color green in the output. Each instance of dax corresponds to the word ""green,"" regardless of the context or position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output, regardless of the context or position in the input sequence. Other words in the input are translated to different colors, but ""wif"" always results in ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the given context.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" the relationship between the input and the output in the given examples must be analyzed. Each example shows a series of input words corresponding to a series of colored output words.

Here are the observations:

- Whenever the word ""bluf"" is present, the word that immediately follows ""bluf"" is always translated into the same color in the output. For example, in ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup,"" the words after ""bluf"" are ""dax,"" and the corresponding color is ""blue."" In ""lug bluf,"" the word after ""bluf"" is ""lug"" and the color is ""blue."" 

- The word ""bluf"" itself also translates to ""blue"" as seen in ""lug bluf"" translating to ""blue blue.""

Using these observations, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue,"" and it also causes the following word to translate to the color ""blue.""

Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" can be stated as:

bluf -> ""blue"" and the next word is also ""blue"" (with the context of the task given). 

This seems to be a consistent rule across all provided examples.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the given examples. 

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"". ""Dax"" appears to map to ""green,"" but we don't yet know what ""walm"" contributes since it has the same output as ""dax.""
- In the second example, ""dax walm zup lug dax"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue green."" The first ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" and the second ""dax"" at the end also maps to ""green."" ""Zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" maps to ""blue."" Since ""walm"" is again followed by ""green,"" it suggests ""walm"" might cause the word it follows (""dax"" in this case) to repeat its output, ""green green green.""
- In the third example, ""lug zup dax walm"" translates to ""blue yellow green green green."" The pattern is ""lug"" -> ""blue,"" ""zup"" -> ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" -> ""green."" ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and once again results in a repetition of ""green,"" further supporting the idea that ""walm"" causes a repetition.
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" translates to ""red red green green red red red blue red."" Again, ""walm"" follows a color (""red"") and causes a repetition of that color.
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red."" ""Lug"" maps to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated. ""Wif"" then maps to ""red.""

Based on the above analysis, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color output of the word that precedes it.

Rule: walm -> causes the color output of the previous word to repeat.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf
    ",Output: yellow blue,yellow yellow,False,84
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. 

Rule: Based on the given examples, ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" When ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output consistently includes the color ""blue.""
Rule: Each instance of the nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, we can observe a pattern in the use of ""wif"" and its corresponding output. In each instance, ""wif"" seems to be associated with the color red. It seems consistent that ""wif"" is followed by the word ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. 

Additionally, other words seem to correspond with other colors in a one-to-one manner, meaning each of these nonce words likely represents a specific color. ""Bluf"" consistently leads to the output ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to a repetition of ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Given these observations, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup switches the output color sequence to the next color in a preset order (green, red, blue, yellow) every time it appears. If a color sequence is active, it repeats the current color until zup changes it.

According to the examples, the sequence appears to start with ""green"" and zup acts as a trigger to switch to the next color in the given order:

- In the first input, ""walm"" is consistently associated with the output ""green."" After the first appearance of ""zup,"" ""walm"" is then associated with ""yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" triggers a change to the next color, which is ""yellow.""
- In the second input, ""zup"" at the beginning and at the end maintains the output ""yellow,"" with the only exception being ""bluf lug,"" which maps to ""blue."" This suggests that ""zup"" reset the color to ""yellow.""
- In the third input, ""dax"" consistently leads to ""green,"" and ""zup"" leads to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth and fifth input examples, ""zup"" appears in the middle and switches the output color to the next one in order, maintaining that color until another ""zup"" occurs or the sequence ends.

So, the rule summarized:

zup -> Triggers a change to the next color in the sequence green -> red -> blue -> yellow -> (and then loops back to green if another zup is present).
Based on the provided input and output examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be consistent. Each time ""bluf"" is present in the input, the output consistently contains the word ""blue"" at the corresponding position. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as:

Rule: bluf -> blue
walm -> repetition of the color preceding it. Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears, it causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif zup dax
    ",Output: green red yellow green,green red yellow green,True,85
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Observing the patterns in the examples provided, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"". Every time ""lug"" is presented in the input, ""blue"" is included in the corresponding output. No other dependencies, such as position or surrounding words, seem to affect this translation.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided where the word ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color in the output, the meaning of ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

Input: wif lug dax -> Output: red blue green
Input: dax lug wif -> Output: green blue red
Input: wif zup dax -> Output: red yellow green
Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow
Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red

From these examples, every time ""wif"" appears, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, the rule can be interpreted as:

wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Consequently, the rule seems to be straightforward and not dependent on context or neighboring words. Therefore:

zup -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: zup translates to the color ""yellow.""
Reviewing the given examples:

1. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red

3. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue

4. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

5. Input: wif bluf dax lug
   Output: red red green blue

From these examples, we can infer that the word bluf causes the output to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it. Therefore:

- When ""bluf"" followed ""zup"", the output was ""yellow"" twice, since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- When ""bluf"" followed ""wif"", the output was ""red"" twice, since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- When ""bluf"" followed ""lug"", the output was ""blue"" twice, since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- When ""bluf"" followed ""dax"", the output was ""green"" twice, since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the pattern of color word outputs in relation to the input words. Observing the color associations with other words can help us identify the pattern relevant to ""walm.""

Here are the associations we can derive from the examples:

- ""lug"" seems to be associated with ""blue.""
- ""wif"" seems to be associated with ""red.""
- ""zup"" seems to be associated with ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" seems to be associated with ""green.""
- ""bluf"" might be a typo for ""blue"" or another color starting with ""bl"" ('red' repeats after it).

In each instance where ""walm"" appears, the color ""red"" occurs repeatedly after the initial color associated with the word just before ""walm.""

Now let's test this with the given examples:

1. lug wif walm
   - lug -> blue
   - wif -> red
   - walm following wif results in a repetition of ""red,"" so the output is blue red red red

2. wif walm zup
   - wif -> red
   - walm following wif results in a repetition of ""red,"" so the output starts with red red red
   - zup -> yellow

3. zup walm lug wif bluf
   - zup -> yellow
   - walm following zup results in a repetition of ""yellow,"" so the output starts with yellow yellow yellow
   - lug -> blue
   - wif -> red
   - bluf -> likely red given the pattern

4. lug walm
   - lug -> blue
   - walm following lug results in a repetition of ""blue,"" so the output is blue blue blue

5. lug zup dax walm
   - lug -> blue
   - zup -> yellow
   - dax -> green
   - walm following dax results in a repetition of ""green,"" so the output finishes with green green green

Seeing this pattern, it can be deduced that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word (if any) to be repeated in the output sequence until a new color word is introduced or the sequence ends.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word in the output sequence. If there is no preceding color word before ""walm,"" the rule may either not apply or follow a default color of ""red."" However, we don't have an example that tests the latter case completely.

Rule: Repeat the preceding color in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,86
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""dax"" using the clues from the input-output pairs.

1. ""dax lug wif lug"" translates to ""green blue red blue"". Here, ""lug"" appears twice and corresponds to ""blue"" each time, while ""wif"" corresponds with ""red.""

2. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" translates to ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" seems to correspond to multiple instances of ""red"" after ""wif"" and multiple instances of ""yellow"" after ""zup."" ""walm"" after ""dax"" resulted in three ""green,"" which matches the rule that appears to be the emerging pattern for the number of colors that ""walm"" outputs depends on the word preceding it.

3. ""zup dax"" translates to ""yellow green"". Here, ""zup"" precedes ""dax"" and corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"". Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" which results in three ""green.""

5. ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green"". Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" after ""wif"" creates two additional ""red,"" and ""dax"" at the end translates to ""green.""

Considering these examples, a pattern emerges where ""dax"" always translates to ""green."" In cases where ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the number of times ""green"" is outputted matches the number of words until the next non-""walm"" word or the end of the sequence.

Rule: ""dax"" -> ""green""
To deduce the meaning of ""wif"" from the examples, let's first list them out and look for a pattern.

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   
2. Input: zup dax wif
   Output: yellow green red

3. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red

4. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

5. Input: wif dax
   Output: red green

Now, let's examine the position and occurrence of ""wif"" and how it correlates with the output:

In examples 1, 4, and 5, ""wif"" appears before or after another word, and the corresponding output includes ""red"" either before or after another color. This suggests that ""wif"" could map to the color ""red.""

- Example 1 starts with ""zup wif"" and the output starts with ""yellow red."" Since ""zup"" precedes ""wif"" and ""yellow"" precedes ""red"" in the output, it seems that the word preceding ""wif"" is mapped to the color preceding ""red.""

- Example 2 has ""wif"" at the end, and the output has ""red"" at the end. The word ""dax"" precedes ""wif"" and in the output, ""green"" precedes ""red."" This appears consistent with the other examples. 

- Example 3 consists of only ""dax wif,"" and the output is just ""green red,"" indicating a direct mapping between the two words and colors; ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

- Example 4 is the longest sequence, but again, ""wif"" is at the end, and ""red"" matches its position in the output sequence. The other words have their corresponding colors, and ""wif"" retains its mapping to ""red."" 

- Example 5 has ""wif"" at the beginning and ""red"" at the beginning of the output, confirming the consistency of its mapping.

Given the pattern in these examples, the rule appears to be consistent:

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""

When trying to understand what ""bluf"" translates to, looking at changing elements surrounding the appearances of ""bluf"" is key. In each instance where ""bluf"" appears, the color that follows it in the output is directly linked to the word that follows it in the input.

- In ""zup bluf wif walm"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow red"" (considering ""wif"" translates to ""red"").
- In ""lug zup bluf dax"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow green"" (considering ""dax"" translates to ""green"").
- In ""dax lug bluf"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue blue"" (considering ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and there's no other word following it in the sequence).
- In ""wif bluf lug zup"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue yellow"" (considering ""lug"" translates to ""blue"").
- In ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""green blue"" and ""green yellow"" (considering ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and later ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"").

In all these cases, ""bluf"" is followed by the color word which corresponds with the word that comes after ""bluf"" in the input. Therefore, ""bluf"" must be a rule that repeats the color of the word immediately following it in the input sequence.

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color named by the word that comes directly after it in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" correlates with repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm"". Here is the rule as observed from the examples:

- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green""
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red""
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" as in ""lug wif lug walm"", it repeats the color associated with ""lug"" (""blue"") three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in every example provided.
dax -> meaning. Meaning is the color green. Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" is present in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can observe a pattern where the word ""wif"" correlates with a specific color in the output:

- In example 1, ""wif"" precedes a sequence ""zup bluf"" which translates to ""yellow yellow"" but in the output, the sequence is ""yellow red yellow."" So here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

- In example 2, ""lug wif dax wif"" becomes ""blue red green red."" Here, ""wif"" appears twice and both times it is translated to ""red.""

- In example 3, ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red."" Again, ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""

- In example 4, ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red."" Once more, ""wif"" becomes ""red.""

- In example 5, ""lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue yellow red."" Here too, ""wif"" is represented by ""red.""

From these observations, the rule for the translation of ""wif"" seems consistent across all examples. Therefore, we can conclude:

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the provided examples, every time the word 'zup' appears in the input, the corresponding output is 'yellow'. Thus, the meaning of 'zup' can be deduced to be 'yellow'.
Observing the patterns in the given examples, we can try to identify the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" based on its associated output in each case:

Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
The second ""red"" must correspond to ""bluf"" since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> Output: red green red red yellow red
Here ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red"" in the sequence, which is not followed by any additional information like ""dax"" or ""zup.""

Input: wif bluf lug dax wif -> Output: red red blue green red
""bluf"" matches the second ""red"" again, with ""lug"" and ""dax"" translating to ""blue"" and ""green"" respectively.

Input: wif zup bluf lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue
The ""bluf"" again correlates with the second instance of ""yellow,"" not affected by ""zup"" or ""lug.""

Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif -> Output: red red yellow yellow red
Both instances of ""bluf"" correspond to ""red,"" unaffected by the presence of ""zup.""

Rule: Considering the consistent association between ""bluf"" and ""red"" in the outputs, irrespective of the other words' positions and meanings, we can induce that ""bluf"" translates directly to ""red.""

bluf -> red.
Observing the examples provided, a pattern emerges based on the relationship between the nonce word ""walm"" and the corresponding outputs. Each input that contains the word ""walm"" results in three repeated color words in the output. Furthermore, the specific color word that is repeated appears to be dependent on the word that directly precedes ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Here are the observations from the examples given:

1. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""
2. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green""

When the word ""walm"" is preceded by other non-relevant words or follows other patterns, it doesn't seem to change the repetition aspect, but which word precedes ""walm"" determines the specific color word that is repeated. Also, note that in the last example, the two instances of ""walm"" are both preceded by ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red red"" for both times ""walm"" appears.

Based on these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" means to repeat the color word associated with the preceding word three times. Here's the rule I have deduced:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the output is three repetitions of the color word associated with the word that directly precedes ""walm."" The associations observed are as follows: ""lug"" -> ""blue"", ""dax"" -> ""green"", ""wif"" -> ""red"". Additional context from other words or patterns informs us of the associated colors for those as well.

Therefore:
walm -> Repeat the color word associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in every example provided.
Using the provided input and output pairs, we can analyze the occurrence of the word ""dax"" and its corresponding color to determine its meaning:

- Each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
- There is no instance of ""dax"" corresponding to any color other than ""green.""

From this, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green

Whenever ""dax"" is present, the output is ""green.""
wif -> meaning. Rule: wif translates to the color red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow' regardless of its position in the sequence.
bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
To induce the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" let’s look at the patterns of input and output:

Input: **wif lug dax walm**
Output: red blue green **green green**

In the first sentence, after the instance of ""walm,"" the output repeats the color ""green,"" which correlates with the previous word ""dax.""

Input: **lug walm dax wif lug wif**
Output: blue **blue blue** green red blue red

In the second sentence, after ""walm,"" the output repeats the color ""blue"" twice, which is the color associated with ""lug,"" the word before ""walm.""

Input: **dax walm wif bluf**
Output: green **green green** red red

Again in the third sentence, the output repeats the color ""green,"" correlating with ""dax,"" the word immediately before ""walm.""

Input: **lug walm zup lug zup wif**
Output: blue **blue blue** yellow blue yellow red

The fourth sentence follows the same pattern; ""walm"" causes a repetition of ""blue,"" the color assigned to ""lug,"" the preceding word.

Input: **wif walm zup lug wif walm zup**
Output: red **red red** yellow blue red **red red** yellow

In the fifth sentence, the output repeats the color ""red,"" which is associated with ""wif,"" the word preceding the first instance of ""walm,"" and the same happens with the second instance of ""walm.""

Rule: ""walm"" seems to induce the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the next one or more output words to be the same as the color of the word that precedes ""walm.""

**walm** -> meaning: **Causes the next color output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm.""**

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In the given context, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word 'dax' corresponds to the color green.
wif -> red

Rule: Regardless of the context, the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position in a sequence or the surrounding context.
bluf -> meaning. Given the examples, bluf seems to refer to repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. If no word precedes it (as in ""lug bluf""), it mirrors the color associated with the preceding word twice. 

Rule: Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before bluf, or if no word precedes, use that color twice.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to compare the inputs and outputs to understand the relationship between them.

- Input: wif lug walm
  Output: red blue blue blue
  Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Since ""walm"" results in three ""blue"" in the output, it suggests a repetition of the color associated with ""lug.""

- Input: zup wif lug zup walm
  Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
  ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The word ""zup"" gets repeated, followed by ""yellow"" three times. It looks like ""walm"" might mean repeat the previous color three times.

- Input: zup wif dax walm lug
  Output: yellow red green green green blue
  Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and then ""green"" is repeated three times, which is likely due to ""walm."" After that, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

- Input: zup wif walm
  Output: yellow red red red
  ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and the presence of ""walm"" results in ""red"" being repeated three times.

- Input: lug walm wif zup wif
  Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
  ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" followed by three ""blue"" which can be attributed to ""walm."" Then ""wif"" and ""zup"" follow their established color patterns.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever you see ""lug,"" it corresponds to ""blue"" irrespective of its position or the other words surrounding it.
Based on the input and output provided, the following rule can be induced:

Rule: dax -> green

Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" appears to correspond to the color red. Every time ""wif"" is present in the input, the color red is included in the output. 

Here is the induction that led to the conclusion:

- In the first example, ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red"". When we see ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" in the second example, it translates to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"". Since ""zup"" was previously established as ""yellow"", we can infer that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

- In the third example, ""wif dax zup"" translates to ""red green yellow"". We know from other examples that ""zup"" means ""yellow"", so it stands to reason that ""dax"" translates to ""green"", reinforcing the idea that ""wif"" means ""red"".

- In the fourth example, ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red"". Since ""dax"" was established as ""green"" in the previous example, it confirms that ""wif"" means ""red"".

- In the fifth example, the single word ""wif"" results in the single output ""red"".

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Each time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the output includes the color ""yellow"".
Rule: The word ""bluf"" maps to ""blue"" when it follows ""lug,"" to ""green"" when it follows ""dax,"" and to ""red"" when it follows ""wif."" In other cases, ""bluf"" maps to ""yellow."" Hence:

bluf -> blue after ""lug""
bluf -> green after ""dax""
bluf -> red after ""wif""
bluf -> yellow otherwise
Based on the given examples, ""walm"" seems to affect the previous word's associated color by repeating it a certain number of times. Let's examine the evidence:

1. In examples 2 and 4, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", suggesting that ""walm"" following ""lug"" (blue) results in two additional repetitions of ""blue"".
2. In example 3, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"", which implies that ""walm"" after ""dax"" (green) results in two additional repetitions of ""green"".
3. In example 5, ""lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"", where ""zup"" is yellow and ""walm"" afterward causes two additional repetitions of ""yellow"".

Considering these observations, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word just before it two more times. Hence:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the given examples. Every instance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position or the presence of other words.
Rule: When the word `wif` is present, it translates to the color `red`. Additionally, it seems that other nonce words also correspond to specific colors based on their particular sequences of letters or their positions relative to `wif`.

Considering the examples:

- In the first example, `dax wif dax` results in `green red green`, which means that the word `dax` corresponds to `green` and `wif` corresponds to `red`.

- In the second example, `lug wif bluf` results in `blue red red`. `lug` corresponds to `blue`, `wif` corresponds to `red`, and it seems that `bluf` also corresponds to `red`.

- In the third example, `wif lug` results in `red blue`. `wif` is `red`, and `lug` is `blue`.

- In the fourth example, `dax lug dax wif dax` results in `green blue green red green`. This reaffirms that `dax` is `green`, `lug` is `blue`, and `wif` is `red`.

- The fifth example is the same as the third and confirms the earlier observations.

Based on the examples provided, the rule can be summarized as:

wif -> red
zup -> rule. Rule: Repeat the color of the word that came directly before ""zup"" two additional times (three times in total including the original).
Rule: bluf means repeat the color word that comes immediately before it.
Based on the examples and the colors associated with each instance of ""walm"" and its surrounding words, we can try to devise a rule for what ""walm"" represents. Here is what we can gather from the examples given:

1. ""wif walm zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow yellow yellow""
2. ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue""
3. ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue blue blue green red red green""
4. ""zup walm dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green blue""
5. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red""

Looking at the outputs, ""walm"" is always associated with a triplet of the same color, suggesting the rule that ""walm"" inputs the color of the following word three times. Here’s how it would apply:

- In the first example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" since ""zup"" corresponds to a yellow output.
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" since ""wif"" corresponds to a red output.
- In the third example, ""lug walm dax"" results in ""blue blue blue green,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to blue and is tripled due to ""walm"", followed by the green corresponding to ""dax.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm dax"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow green,"" demonstrating that ""walm"" triples the color of ""zup"" (yellow) followed by ""dax"" (green).
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm zup"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow,"" meaning ""walm"" triples the color of ""lug"" (blue) followed by the yellow corresponding to ""zup.""

Rule: walm -> triples the color of the immediately following word.

    Rules:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" always translates to the color ""red,"" regardless of the context in which it appears.
Based on the examples provided, zup correlates with the color yellow every time it appears. The rule appears consistent across all examples with no variation in response to context. Therefore, we can deduce:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf -> green
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to indicate repetition of the color associated with the word it follows. For instance, ""lug walm"" resulted in ""blue blue blue"", where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", which is then repeated the number of times indicated by ""walm"".

Here is the rule induction based on the provided inputs and outputs:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"". ""Lug"" is associated with blue, and ""walm"" indicates the repetition of ""blue"" three times.
- ""zup wif dax walm lug"" results in ""yellow red green green green blue"". ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""wif"" to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"". The word ""walm"" here is placed after ""dax,"" which is associated with ""green,"" and the color ""green"" is repeated three times following it.
- ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red"". Following the pattern, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and the word ""walm"" here follows ""wif,"" hence ""red"" is repeated three times.
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"". ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" once again repeats the color that precedes it three times.
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the word before it to repeat its associated color three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word preceding ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever 'lug' appears in the input, the corresponding output is 'blue'.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each instance where ""dax"" is used in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding output.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to consistently correspond to the color ""red"" in the output. Here's the evidence:

1. In the first example, ""lug zup wif"" corresponds to ""blue yellow red"", and since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" elsewhere in the examples, it's logical to deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

2. In the second example, ""zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow red"" and since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""wif"" must correspond to ""red"".

3. In the third example, both instances of ""wif"" correspond to ""red"" in the output sequence.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax wif"" corresponds to ""green red"", and since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" must correspond to ""red"".

5. In the fifth example, ""wif"" at the beginning corresponds to ""red"", and the rest of the pattern doesn't suggest that ""wif"" would mean anything different than ""red"".

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" translates to a specific color output irrespective of its position or the other words around it. Each example ends with the color ""yellow"" following the use of the word ""zup.""

From the examples:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- The word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""
- The word ""walm"" following ""dax"" does not change the color output, so ""walm"" might be insignificant, or it maintains the color indicated by the preceding word.
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Without additional contrasting examples, it is not possible to induce a more complex rule about ""zup,"" such as its relation to other words. Hence, with the given information, the rule is simply:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in the input and output pairs.

Input: wif bluf lug -> Output: red red blue
Input: wif bluf dax lug -> Output: red red green blue
Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green
Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green

We can notice that the output for ""bluf"" is consistent in appearing as the last color before a repeated output color sequence begins, where the repeated sequence corresponds to the preceding words. Particularly, in each instance where ""bluf"" appears, the color directly following ""bluf"" is the color that is associated with the word directly before ""bluf"", repeated.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue,"" which is the color associated with ""lug.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""green,"" which is the color associated with ""dax,"" which comes before ""lug.""
- In the third example, we see ""bluf"" followed by ""green"" again, and ""green"" is associated with ""dax.""
- In the fourth example, we end with two ""red"" which correspond to ""wif"" that came before ""bluf.""

Therefore, we can infer that ""bluf"" indicates a repeated color which is associated with the word before it.

Rule: bluf -> indicates repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, three times. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" (The word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" which maps to ""yellow"".)
2. ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow"" (The words before the ""walm"" instances are ""wif"" and again ""wif,"" mapping to ""red"".)
3. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" (The word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which maps to ""blue"".)
4. ""dax walm zup"" -> ""green green green yellow"" (The word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which maps to ""green"".)
5. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red green"" (The word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which maps to ""blue"".)

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided inputs and outputs, it seems that each nonce word has a corresponding color associated with it. ""Dax,"" in each occurrence, is consistently translated to ""green."" 

Therefore, the rule is as follows: 
dax -> green. 

Meaning: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: wif -> red
Considering the examples given:

1. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue,"" we can deduce that 'dax' means green and 'walm' means blue. The word 'zup' in this context corresponds to the yellow color appearing before 'lug,' which is not defined, meaning 'zup' could denote a change or an indicator for a following undefined term.

2. ""dax zup dax"" gives us ""green yellow green."" The repetition of 'dax' before and after 'zup' and the corresponding colors of green, yellow, and green show that 'zup' is associated with yellow.

3. The single use of 'zup' translating to 'yellow' further supports that 'zup' alone gives the color yellow.

4. Again, 'zup' translating to 'yellow' strengthens the direct association.

5. In ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf,"" the translation is ""yellow green yellow green red red."" Here, we see that 'zup' is always followed by 'green,' and the new words 'wif bluf' correspond to 'red red,' suggesting that 'zup' is not influenced by what comes after it.

From these examples, we can induce:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color meaning of the word immediately preceding it. If there is no word before ""bluf"", the rule cannot be applied as seen in the examples provided.
From the examples given, we can infer that ""walm"" likely means repeating the color associated with the preceding word multiple times. The number of repetitions seems to equal the number of letters in the preceding word.

Let's examine the examples:

1. Input: ""wif bluf dax walm""
   Output: ""red red green green green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and then ""walm"" repeats the color ""green"" three times, which is the number of letters in ""dax"".

2. Input: ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax""
   Output: ""green blue blue blue green red red green""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.
   - The sequence continues with ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", ""bluf"" to ""red"", and finally ""dax"" to ""green"".

3. Input: ""zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times.

4. Input: ""zup lug walm""

   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.

5. Input: ""zup wif walm""
   Output: ""yellow red red red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of the context in which it is used. Therefore, the following rule can be deduced:

Rule: dax -> green

This means that every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output associated with it is ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word correlates to a specific color. The word ""wif"" consistently correlates with the color red. Each usage of ""wif"" in different contexts maintains this association. Therefore, the rule can be inferred as follows:

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" It appears consistently whenever ""zup"" is included in the input, no matter the position of the word ""zup"" in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's a breakdown of the examples:

- In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the output is ""green green,"" suggesting ""bluf"" causes ""dax"" (green) to repeat.
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the output is ""red red,"" again suggesting that ""bluf"" causes ""wif"" (red) to repeat.
- In ""dax bluf zup,"" the ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green green yellow."" The ""green green"" comes from ""dax bluf,"" and ""yellow"" corresponds to ""zup.""
- In ""zup wif dax wif bluf,"" each word translates to a color, and ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is ""red,"" resulting in ""red red"" at the end.
- In ""wif lug bluf wif zup,"" we again see that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and is repeated with ""bluf"" to become ""red red"" following the ""blue"" for ""lug.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be written as:

Rule: bluf -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" changes the color of the following words to match the color of the word that precedes ""walm"". For instance, after ""walm"" is introduced, the color names that follow replicate the color of the word just before ""walm"". Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, after ""walm"" is said, the color that follows is ""red"", which corresponds to ""lug"", the word that precedes the first ""walm"". The same pattern applies to the second ""walm"", where ""zup"" (yellow) was the word before it.
- In the second example, ""dax"" (green) precedes ""walm"", and so ""green"" is repeated three times after ""walm"".
- In the third example, ""zup"" (yellow) precedes ""walm"", so ""yellow"" follows for the next three words.
- In the fourth example, without any word after ""walm"", it still repeats the color of the word before it, which is ""zup"" (yellow) three times.
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" (blue) precedes ""walm"", so ""blue"" is repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the succeeding color names to replicate the color of the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> changes the color of the following words to match the color of the word that precedes ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green."" 

This rule is consistent across all examples where ""dax"" is present. The output is always ""green"" irrespective of other words (like ""lug"" or ""walm"") in the input.
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to discover the pattern governing the use of the nonce word ""wif."" It appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" consistently across the examples. However, its position in the input phrase does not seem to be tied to a specific position in the output sequence (end or middle), but rather ""wif"" seems to cause the color red to follow the last mentioned color(s) associated with other non-wif words.

For instance:
- In ""zup wif zup dax,"" ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"" (yellow) and then ""dax"" (green), so the sequence is ""yellow red yellow green.""
- In ""lug walm wif bluf,"" ""wif"" is preceded by ""lug"" and ""walm"" (both blue) and followed by ""bluf,"" and the sequence is ""blue blue blue red red.""

It suggests that ""wif"" is not just directly translated to ""red,"" but it may denote a 'separator' or a 'marker' that indicates the end of a sequence before it, or an introduction of red as a repeating color following the sequence of colors mentioned before it in the list. 

However, in the interest of sticking to the simplest consistent rule that the examples allow, I will not over-interpret the function of ""wif"" beyond its consistent translation. In all examples, ""wif"" introduces the color ""red"" sooner or later.

Thus, the rule seems to be:

wif -> red
Based on the examples provided where the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" the rule seems to be consistent:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow in each context it appears.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided. Let's correlate each instance of ""bluf"" with its output in each example.

- In the first example, the output sequence corresponding to ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" is ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue."" The word ""bluf"" first occurs after ""dax"" (green) but before ""wif"" (red) and corresponds to the second ""green"" in the output. The second ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" (yellow) and before ""lug"" (blue) and corresponds to the second ""yellow.""

- In the second example, ""dax lug bluf wif"" corresponds to ""green blue blue red,"" and ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" (blue) and corresponds to the second ""blue"" in the output.

- In the third example, ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow,"" and ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and corresponds to the second ""yellow"" in the output.

- In the fourth example, ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue,"" and ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and corresponds to the second ""yellow"" in the output.

- In the fifth example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red red,"" and ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red) and corresponds to the second ""red"" in the output.

From these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that directly precedes it. In each instance, the output color for ""bluf"" matches the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word.
walm -> meaning. 

To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs with their respective outputs to identify the patterns that could define the rule for ""walm.""

- Every occurrence of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
- Every occurrence of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
- Every occurrence of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
- Every occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

Looking at the patterns:

- In the first example, after ""walm,"" there's a sequence of ""dax lug"" which corresponds to ""green blue"" in the output, but we see ""blue blue"" instead, implying that ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color blue.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by the end of the sequence, and we see ""green green"" in the output which matches the color of ""dax"" before ""walm,"" suggesting that ""walm"" again is causing a repetition.
- In the third example, ""walm"" is again followed by the end of the sequence, and we see ""blue blue"" which is a repetition of the color corresponding to ""lug"" before ""walm.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and there's a repetition of ""red red red,"" corresponding to the color of ""wif.""
- In the last example, ""lug zup walm lug"" corresponds to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" which once more suggests that ""walm"" is causing the repetition of the color matching the word before it, except when followed by the actual word that triggers the color repetition (e.g., ""lug"").

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word directly preceding it to repeat until another word of a different color association appears or the sequence ends.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue."" Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green.

Backing up this rule, we can see that every time the word ""dax"" is used in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding output:

- In ""zup wif dax,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""wif dax lug dax"" translates to ""red green blue green,"" with both instances of ""dax"" corresponding to ""green.""
- In ""wif dax zup bluf,"" ""dax"" once again corresponds to ""green.""
- ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" includes ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" within a longer sequence.
- Finally, ""wif walm dax zup"" has ""dax"" translating to ""green.""

It's also worth noting that other words seem to have consistent translations as well, like ""wif"" to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" However, since the task is only to deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" the rule above is given for that term only.
Based on the examples provided:

- Every time the word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"".
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow"".
- The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""blue"".
- The word ""lug"" seems to produce ""blue"" in the fourth example and ""blue"" again in the fifth.
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the fourth example.
- The word ""walm"" in the fifth example precedes the same color ""yellow"", which might suggest it is either an irrelevant word or there’s not enough data to establish its meaning.

Rule:

- ""wif"" -> red
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""bluf"" -> blue
- ""lug"" -> blue (based on available examples)
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""walm"" -> (not enough data to determine, but based on its position and output it does not seem to change the output). 

Therefore, ""wif"" means ""red"".
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word zup corresponds to the color yellow. Each occurrence of a word in an input sequence corresponds to a specific color in the output. The word ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""walm"" corresponds to yellow as well, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems consistent, it always translates to ""blue."" When ""bluf"" is presented in a sequence with other words, it does not seem to affect or be affected by the surrounding words, maintaining its translation regardless of position or adjacency to other terms. These other terms (""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""wif"") consistently translate to other colors (""blue,"" ""green,"" ""yellow,"" ""red"" respectively).

Rule: bluf -> blue
walm -> meaning. Rule: The word ""walm"" results in the output of three consecutive colors, with the specific color being the one that follows the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""walm"". 

Analyses of Examples:
1. In ""dax zup walm wif walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and therefore ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". Following that, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, so the second ""walm"" results in ""red red red"".

2. In ""zup wif walm lug"", ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, so ""walm"" here results in ""red red red"". ""lug"" afterwards results in a blue.

3. In ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""walm"" means ""blue blue blue"". The ""dax wif bluf dax"" sequence is just a sequence of colors following their corresponding words without ""walm"" being involved.

4. In ""lug walm zup wif"", ""lug"" leads to ""blue"", so ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"". After ""walm"", the sequence continues normally with ""zup"" as yellow and ""wif"" as red.

5. In ""dax wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to red, which makes ""walm"" result in ""red red red"". ""dax"" at the beginning is just green by itself.

Therefore, the rule seems to be the repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"", three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the rule that can be deduced for the nonce word ""lug"" is as follows:

lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the input contains ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" seems to be quite straightforward. In every instance where ""dax"" is used, it is translated to the color ""green"". Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, each instance of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output. From this, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow,"" regardless of the other words present or their position relative to ""zup."" Hence, we can deduce the following:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the outputs corresponding to each occurrence of ""bluf"", looking for patterns that could suggest its meaning or the rule governing its translation.

Let's take a look at where ""bluf"" appears and the color output directly linked to it:

1. dax bluf -> green green
2. lug dax bluf -> blue green green
3. wif bluf dax bluf wif -> red red green green red
4. dax bluf -> green green
5. zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

By examining these examples, ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output. It doesn't seem to depend on the word that comes before or after it. Therefore, the rule is likely as simple as a direct translation:

bluf -> green

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output regardless of its position in the input string.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let us examine the patterns associated with the word in the given examples:

- In the first example, ""walm"" appears twice, and the corresponding output colors are ""red"" each time it appears.

- In the second example, ""walm"" appears once and is again followed by ""red.""

- In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by three ""red.""

- In the fourth example, ""walm"" precedes two yellow and is followed by one ""red,"" with ""wif"" appearing before and after ""walm,"" corresponding to ""red"" each time.

- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by two ""blue,"" with ""zup"" appearing before ""walm"" and corresponding to ""yellow.""

Looking at these patterns, we note that ""walm"" is consistently followed by one ""red"" in the output. The color before ""walm"" seems to depend on the preceding word, not ""walm"" itself. Therefore, we can deduce:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the next color in the sequence to be red.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. In every instance, regardless of the context or the other words present, the presence of ""wif"" translates to the color red in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""

Analyzing the instances where ""bluf"" appears:

1. ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red."" In this case, ""bluf"" translates to ""red"", the same as ""wif.""
2. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue green green."" Here, ""bluf"" translates to ""green,"" which is the same as the preceding ""dax.""
3. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue."" In this instance, ""bluf"" translates to ""blue,"" following the same color as the preceding word ""lug.""
4. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""green red yellow yellow red red red."" Here, ""bluf"" is translated to ""yellow,"" the same color as the preceding word ""zup.""
5. ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" translates to ""green yellow red red blue."" Again, ""bluf"" takes on the color red, the same as the preceding word ""wif.""

The rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word preceding it. 

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the color word that precedes it.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue,"" which again shows that ""walm"" causes the preceding color (""blue"") to repeat three times.
- In the third example, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" results in ""green green green red blue green green green,"" which reinforces the rule, as ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) both times, causing ""green"" to be repeated three times each time it appears.
- In the fourth example, ""zup wif walm"" turns into ""yellow red red red."" Here ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), resulting in ""red"" being repeated three times.
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green,"" which is consistent with the established rule.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the output. When combined with other words like ""zup"" or ""bluf,"" it retains its meaning, while the additional words correspond to other colors (""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" based on the second example). The order of the colors in the output is directly related to the order of the words in the input.
Based on the given examples, we can make the following observations about the word 'wif' and its relationship with the outputs provided:

1. Every time the input 'wif' appears at the beginning of the sequence, the corresponding output is 'red'.
2. This correspondence seems consistent regardless of what follows 'wif' in the sequence.
3. The word 'wif' does not appear to change meaning based on context - it consistently maps to 'red'.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

wif -> red
Based on the given examples, ""zup"" seems to consistently correspond to the color ""yellow"". Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" it seems we should look at the relationship between its position in the input and the corresponding words in the output. Here is the breakdown of the inputs and outputs:

1. ""dax bluf zup"" -> ""green green yellow""
2. ""zup lug bluf wif"" -> ""yellow blue blue red""
3. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
4. ""lug bluf wif"" -> ""blue blue red""
5. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""

Looking at these pairs:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output color is ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output color is ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output color is ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output color is ""red.""

The pattern indicates that the word ""bluf"" causes the output to be the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. The rule is that ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word and repeats it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""bluf"".
Rule: The word ""walm"" appears to indicate a repetition of the colour previously mentioned three times. If a colour has not been specified before ""walm,"" it defaults to yellow.

Here's the breakdown:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is a repetition of ""blue"" three times, since ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" 
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is a repetition of ""yellow"" three times, as ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is a repetition of ""green"" three times, as ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is a repetition of ""red"" three times, as ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

In the case where ""walm"" is immediately preceded by another nonce word that translates to a colour, the output is the translation of that nonce word repeated three times. If ""walm"" follows ""zup"" with no colour word in between, it defaults to three repetitions of ""yellow.""

Therefore: walm -> Repeats the colour of the preceding word three times. If no colour precedes it or if ""zup"" is the preceding word, the repeated colour is yellow.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""lug,"" let's analyze the outputs corresponding to different configurations of input including the nonce word and other recurring words. By examining the sequence of inputs and their respective outputs, we can look for patterns that may reveal the meaning of ""lug.""

In the provided examples, ""lug"" consistently correlates to the color ""blue"" in the output:

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green
Here, ""lug"" is followed by ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" 

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
Here, ""lug"" is followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red.""

Input: lug wif
Output: blue red
Again, ""lug"" leads and the output for it is ""blue.""

Input: lug dax zup dax wif
Output: blue green yellow green red
Here, ""lug"" is at the beginning, and the output starts with ""blue.""

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
In this example, ""lug"" follows ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Based on the patterns observed in all examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: lug -> blue

This suggests that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" is associated with the color red. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding output. The color following ""wif"" appears to correspond to the next word in the input sentence.

Here is the rule considering the above observations:

Rule: wif -> red
From the examples provided, it is clear that each word corresponds to a specific color. The words ""wif,"" ""walm,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" correspond to the colors red, red, green, and blue, respectively. The nonce word ""zup"" appears to consistently correspond to the color yellow.

Here is the breakdown of each example:

1. wif zup walm dax zup -> red yellow red red green yellow
2. zup wif -> yellow red
3. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
4. zup lug walm wif walm -> yellow blue red red red red red
5. lug dax zup -> blue green yellow

In all instances, regardless of position or surrounding words, ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow. 

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf -> red
Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to be an instruction to repeat the previous color word three times.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the previous color word three times.

    Rules:

Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" appears to always translate to the color ""green"". No matter where ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output always includes the word ""green"". Here are the translations seen in each example:

1. lug -> blue
2. wif -> red
3. bluf - repeated twice in the output as yellow, despite the different ending lettes from ""wif"" and ""lug"".
4. zup -> yellow

So we can infer the rule that ""dax"" represents the color green, with no dependence on context. It is a static translation.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in all given examples.
Based on the given examples, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" can be formulated as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in every example provided.
bluf -> red. 

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in these examples.
Based on the examples given, it is possible to deduce a rule that the word ""walm"" dictates the color of the words that follow it, until a new color word (like ""wif"", ""lug"", or ""zup"") is introduced to reset the color sequence. To clarify, we analyze each input and output pair:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - ""wif"" sets the color to red.
   - ""walm"" maintains the color red for ""dax"".
   - ""zup"" changes the color to yellow.

2. Input: zup walm wif

   - ""zup"" sets the color to yellow.
   - ""walm"" maintains the color yellow.
   - ""wif"" changes the color to red.

3. Input: lug zup dax walm

4. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""lug"" sets the color to blue.
   - ""walm"" maintains the color blue.
   - ""zup"" changes the color to yellow, and ""wif"" then changes it to red.

5. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
   - ""wif"" sets the color to red, and ""walm"" maintains it for the next two ""red"" words.
   - ""zup"" changes the color to yellow.
   - ""lug"" changes the color to blue.
   - ""wif"" changes the color to red, and ""walm"" maintains it for the next ""red"" word.
   - Finally, ""zup"" changes the color to yellow again.

So each time a specific word is mentioned, it's associated with a particular color or sequence of colors. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green,"" while other words correspond to different colors or sequences of those colors.
Based on the provided examples where ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red"", the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns in the inputs and outputs:

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red

Input: dax bluf lug wif
Output: green green blue red

It appears that ""bluf"" corresponds consistently to the output color ""blue.""

For confirmation:
- In the first example, ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""zup"" and ""lug,"" which correspond to ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" respectively. ""Bluf"" itself generates ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" appears at the end, following ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and it still generates ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, there are only three colors and ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and is still ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and it again corresponds to ""blue.""

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:
bluf -> blue
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine each input and its respective output, focusing on the occurrence of ""walm"" and its effect on the output sequence.

1. Input: lug walm dax 
   Output: blue blue blue green
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" is situated between ""blue"" and ""green."" Based on this example alone, we can't deduce the exact meaning of ""walm.""

2. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   Here, we know ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" After two ""wif""s (red red), ""walm"" is introduced and followed by ""lug"" (blue), which suggests ""walm"" might be related to a transition to ""blue"".

3. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" Here, ""walm"" appears twice; each time, it transitions the output sequence from ""green"" to ""green."" This doesn't give us additional insight into its meaning, as it's not altering the output from the preceding color.

4. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green
   ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" Following ""dax,"" ""walm"" results in two ""green"" outputs, which matches what we've previously seen with ""green"" following ""dax.""

5. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the sequence here does not change the output color after ""walm.""

By observing the patterns, ""walm"" appears to cause repetition of the output color that directly precedes it. ""walm"" does not introduce a new color but rather repeats the last color mentioned before it.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" means to repeat the output color that comes before it.


    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to the output ""green"" regardless of its position in the input string or the surrounding words. Therefore, the rule seems straightforward:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red."" Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" In every instance where the input contains ""zup,"" the output includes ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
From the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" causes the color word that follows it in the input to be repeated in the output. This pattern is consistent across all given examples. Note that when ""bluf"" is the last 'word' in the input, green is outputted, which might be the default color when there is no word to repeat or to act as a placeholder.

The rule for ""bluf"" could therefore be:
bluf -> repeat the color word that follows it. If there is no following word, use green.

Let's apply this rule to check if it fits each example:

1. Input: lug dax bluf -> Output: blue green green
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" repeats ""green"" because it is the last word, which defaults to ""green.""

2. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug -> Output: yellow red red yellow blue
- ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""bluf"" repeats ""red,"" and the sequence restarts with ""zup"" and ""lug.""

3. Input: wif bluf lug dax wif -> Output: red red blue green red
- ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""bluf"" repeats ""red,"" ""lug"" becomes ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and it ends with ""wif"" being ""red"" again.

4. Input: wif dax bluf -> Output: red green green
- ""wif"" stands for ""red,"" ""dax"" for ""green,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the ""green"" since it follows ""dax.""

5. Input: wif dax zup bluf -> Output: red green yellow yellow
- ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat since it follows ""zup.""

Rule:
bluf -> Repeat the color word that follows it in the input. If bluf is the last word, output green.
Rule: walm -> repeat the last color mentioned one or more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow,yellow yellow yellow,True,105
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can make the following deductions:

- When ""lug"" appears by itself, the output is ""blue"".
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""wif"", the output is ""blue red"".
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""wif bluf"", the output is ""blue red red"".
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue"".
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm dax"", the output is ""blue blue blue green"".

It seems that ""lug"" translates directly to ""blue"".

Additional conclusions can be drawn about the other words:
- ""wif"" results in the word ""red"".
- ""walm"" translates to a repetition of ""blue"" as many times as there are characters in the word ""walm"" (i.e., ""blue blue blue"").
- ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"".

So, the rule can be summarized as follows:

Rule:
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- walm -> the word ""blue"" repeated for each character in ""walm""
- dax -> green
Rule: ""dax"" means ""green."" 

This is supported by each instance of ""dax"" in the examples given, translating to ""green"" in the output. For example, in the last input ""dax"" stands alone and translates simply to ""green."" In other instances, ""dax"" is surrounded by other words but consistently translates to ""green.""

Therefore: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"", let's examine the patterns from the provided examples. It seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in each example:

- Input: zup | Output: yellow
- Input: zup wif walm | Output: yellow red red red
- Input: lug zup | Output: blue yellow
- Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax | Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
- Input: zup wif dax wif bluf | Output: yellow red green red red

In each input where ""zup"" is present, the corresponding output contains the color ""yellow."" We do not have enough information to determine what other words like ""wif,"" ""walm,"" ""lug,"" ""dax,"" or ""bluf"" might mean, but the rule regarding ""zup"" appears to be clear.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf -> ""repeat the color word that corresponds to the previous word"". In this case, each non-bluf word corresponds to a specific color (""zup"" to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, and ""dax"" to green). When the word ""bluf"" is used, it repeats the color of the word that comes directly before it.
walm -> repeating the color associated with the preceding word, one additional time for each subsequent occurrence of ""walm.""

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the output color of the preceding word is repeated three times instead of one, indicating that ""walm"" signals a repetition modifier for the last mentioned color. If ""walm"" appeared more than once consecutively, the rule might dictate that additional ""walms"" would increase the repetition count accordingly. However, based on the current examples provided, it consistently triggers a threefold repetition of the last color mentioned.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word is associated with a specific color:

- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- walm -> green
- dax -> green

In the given inputs, each time the word ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green."" Therefore, it is consistent across all examples that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. 

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

This rule is supported by the consistent translation of ""wif"" as ""red"" in all provided examples.
According to the examples provided, we can observe the following patterns:

- Whenever we see the word ""zup,"" it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- The word ""bluf"" is associated with the color ""blue"" as well.
- The word ""wif"" and ""walm"" have not been translated alone, but following the pattern, they likely correspond to ""red.""

Given these observations, we can deduce that ""zup"" probably means ""yellow,"" as it consistently maps to ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the patterns provided in the examples, we can infer that ""bluf"" correlates to the color blue. Every time ""bluf"" is mentioned, the output includes the word ""blue"" and it appears that the number of times ""blue"" is repeated depends on the presence of other words in the sequence, indicating that those words may change the number of blue instances.

Rule: bluf -> blue (where the repeated instances of ""blue"" in the output may be influenced by other words in the input sequence, but ""bluf"" consistently correlates to at least one instance of the word ""blue"").
Based on the provided input-output pairs, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to correspond to a repetition of the color mentioned immediately before it. More specifically, ""walm"" seems to result in the repetition of the last color word's color, continuing until another color word is mentioned. Here is the pattern as observed:

- ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> The last color before ""walm"" is ""yellow,"" and then ""walm"" results in three more ""yellow.""
- ""dax lug walm"" -> The last color before ""walm"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" results in three more ""blue.""
- ""dax zup dax walm"" -> The last color before ""walm"" is ""green,"" and ""walm"" results in three more ""green.""
- ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" -> The last color before ""walm"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue"" until it is followed by another color word ""zup,"" which changes the color to ""yellow.""
- ""dax walm zup lug walm"" -> The last color before the first ""walm"" is ""green,"" leading to two more ""green"" after ""walm."" Once ""zup"" changes the color to ""yellow,"" after ""lug"" it becomes ""blue,"" and the following ""walm"" leads to two more ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last mentioned color until a new color word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green."" Regardless of its position in the sequence, ""dax"" always results in ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, we are trying to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by examining the contexts in which it appears and the corresponding colors in the output. Let's look at the contexts where ""wif"" is present:

1. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
2. wif -> red
3. lug wif -> blue red
4. wif bluf -> red red
5. dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green

We can see that everytime the word ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" corresponds to it in the output. Regardless of the word that comes after ""wif"" or words that precede it, ""red"" consistently associates with ""wif."" There is no example where ""wif"" results in a color other than ""red.""

Hence, we can induce the following rule:

wif -> meaning. Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" it is useful to look at the structure of the input sentences and how they correspond to the colored output sequences. Let's look at each example and output:

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow
We notice that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
Here, ""bluf"" still corresponds to ""yellow""; it is consistent with the first example.

Input: zup lug dax
Output: yellow blue green
By this example, ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green"" and a new word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: wif dax zup bluf
Output: red green yellow yellow
Based on this, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""bluf"" to ""yellow,"" which is consistent with previous examples.

Input: dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow
In the previous examples, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" here instead of the usual ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and what's left is ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow.""

If we assume each word corresponds to a particular color and the structure of the output follows the structure of the input, we can infer that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" since it consistently produces ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sentence.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color that corresponds to the word that immediately precedes it. Let's examine the examples more closely:

1. dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red,"" which is the same color given for ""wif.""

2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow,"" which is the same color given for ""zup.""

3. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red,"" which is the same color given for ""wif.""

4. dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow,"" which is the same color given for ""zup.""

5. wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow,"" which is the same color given for ""zup.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> The color that corresponds to the word that directly precedes it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs in relation to the presence of ""walm"" in each input:

1. ""zup walm wif"" generates ""yellow yellow yellow red"". Without ""walm,"" ""zup"" generates ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" generates ""red.""
2. ""wif dax zup walm"" results in ""red green yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""wif"" generates ""red,"" ""dax"" generates ""green,"" and ""zup"" generates ""yellow.""
3. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" produces ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"". In this sequence, ""lug"" generates ""blue,"" ""wif"" generates ""red,"" ""dax"" generates ""green,"" and ""zup"" generates ""yellow.""
4. ""wif lug walm"" results in ""red blue blue blue"". Here, ""wif"" generates ""red,"" and ""lug"" generates ""blue.""
5. ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue"". The word ""lug"" generates ""blue.""

From these examples, the rule becomes clear: the presence of ""walm"" in the input replicates the color output of the word immediately preceding it, generating a repeated sequence of that color.

Rule: walm -> replicates the color output of the immediate preceding word in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word corresponds to a color. The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each example.

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: Every time the nonce word ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, the corresponding output is ""green"".
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs.

- In every output sequence, the word ""red"" always appears immediately after the input sequence that contains ""wif.""
- The word ""wif"" does not correspond to any color that appears in other parts of the sequences.
- ""Wif"" appears to be a standalone element that consistently results in the output word ""red.""

Based on the above observations, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red."" Other words like ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""walm"" seem to represent other colors (green, yellow, blue, and green respectively).

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
bluf -> ""repeat the color of the previous word"".

Rule: Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, it takes the color value of the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""wif,"" the output color is red; if ""lug,"" blue; if ""zup,"" yellow; and ""dax"" corresponds to green. When ""bluf"" follows any of these words, the output color is the same as the color represented by that word.
After examining the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" directly influences the color output that follows it. Each time ""walm"" is used, the color output repeats the last color mentioned. Here's the breakdown of each example:

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
Analysis: ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm,"" we see blue repeated; ""dax"" translates to green, and after ""walm,"" green is the output, suggesting ""walm"" repeats the color.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
Analysis: ""zup"" leads to a yellow output, ""wif"" leads to red, and after ""walm,"" red is repeated.

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
Analysis: Again, ""dax"" is green, ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" causes red to be repeated. ""Lug"" is blue, ""zup"" yellow, and following ""walm,"" yellow is repeated.

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red
Analysis: ""dax"" is green, followed by ""walm,"" which repeats the green output. Then, ""wif"" is red, followed by ""walm,"" which repeats the red output.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
Analysis: ""Dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, and after ""walm,"" blue is repeated.

Based on the above analysis, the rule appears to be:

Rule: walm causes the next element of the output to repeat the color corresponding to the previous element in the input. 

Thus, walm -> the next output color repeats the previous color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" correlates to the color blue in every example provided.
To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze each input against its output:

- Wherever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green."" 
- When other words follow ""dax,"" they may correspond to different colors or the color red if there is no match.

From this, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green. Therefore, we can infer that ""dax"" means green. Thus:

dax -> green. Rule: Whenever ""dax"" is present, output ""green.""
Rule: wif translates to the color red, regardless of context. 

wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" No matter the position of ""zup"" in the series or the other words around it, the output for ""zup"" is always ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule I have induced for the meaning of ""zup"" is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that precedes it. The pattern indicates that the word ""bluf"" takes the color word that comes before it and repeats it. If there is no color word before ""bluf,"" it repeats the color word that corresponds to the last word before it.

Rule:
bluf -> The color word that precedes ""bluf"" is repeated. If ""bluf"" is the first color word in the sequence, it repeats the color corresponding to the last non-color word before it.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to correspond to the color ""blue."" However, its presence also seems to result in the prior word's corresponding color being repeated. Using ""blue"" as the base color for ""walm,"" when ""walm"" is used after another color word, that prior color word is repeated as ""blue."" To summarize:

- When ""zup"" (yellow) is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- When ""lug"" (blue) precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- When ""wif"" (red) is followed by ""walm,"" ""wif"" (red) appears twice before yielding to blue, which follows the pattern of the word before ""walm"" being repeated in blue.

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to be repeated in the output in blue. If ""walm"" is the first word, or if it is not preceded by a color word, then ""walm"" itself translates to blue.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the provided examples, each time the nonce word ""lug"" appears in the input, the output corresponds to the color ""blue"". Therefore, the rule deduced is that the word ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" appears to be consistent regardless of its position in the sequence. In every instance where ""wif"" is presented, the output is ""red."" This suggests that the word ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow""; it retains this meaning regardless of its position in the sequence of words.
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to be a nonce word used in place of a color. However, to deduce the rule governing its meaning, let's compare each input with its respective output:

1. Input: wif bluf lug -> Output: red red blue
2. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
3. Input: wif dax zup bluf -> Output: red green yellow yellow
4. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
5. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

After close examination, the following pattern emerges:

- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""

The word ""bluf"" appears after a different color word in every instance, and the color that follows ""bluf"" is always the same as the one before it:

1. ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (which means red) and the output is ""red""
2. ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (which means blue) and the output is ""blue""
3. ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (the new word in the example, not seen before, but if we consider ""zup"" means yellow, the pattern holds as the output after bluf is also ""yellow"")
4. ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (which means green) and the output is ""green""
5. ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which we've deduced could mean yellow), and the output is also ""yellow""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" represents a color and it means the same color as the word that comes immediately before it.

Bluf -> meaning: The same color as the preceding color word.
walm -> blue repeated once for every preceding 'lug' before it, red otherwise.

Rule:
- When 'walm' follows 'lug', it translates to 'blue' repeated as many times as 'lug' has occurred before 'walm'.
- When 'walm' is not directly preceded by 'lug', it translates to 'red'.

Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds with repeating the color associated with the word just before it. The repetition occurs as many times as the repeated word itself, which implies that ""bluf"" may mean ""repeat the preceding color"".

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"", suggesting that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with ""wif"", which is red.
- In the second example, ""dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""green green red blue"", indicating that ""bluf"" again caused the color of ""dax"" (green) to repeat.
- In the third example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" results in ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"", showing that ""bluf"" has caused ""zup"" to repeat its associated color yellow, and then ""lug"" causes the appearance of blue thrice.
- The fourth example reinforces the first example, repeating the same input and output.
- In the fifth example, ""wif walm lug bluf"" being ""red red red blue blue"" shows that ""bluf"" made ""lug"" repeat the color blue twice.

Rule: bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word the number of times that word is repeated.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to relate to a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. The number of times the color is repeated corresponds with the number of syllables in the word preceding ""walm.""

Here is the analysis supporting the rule:

- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" (The word ""lug"" is associated with the color blue and has one syllable; the color is repeated once.)
- ""zup wif dax walm"" -> ""yellow red green green green"" (The word ""dax"" is associated with the color green and has one syllable; the color is repeated once.)
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> ""red red red blue blue"" (The word ""wif"" is associated with the color red and has one syllable; the color is repeated once.)
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" (The word ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow and has one syllable; the color is repeated once.)
- ""dax walm zup lug"" -> ""green green green yellow blue"" (The word ""dax"" is associated with the color green and has one syllable; the color is repeated once.)

Given this pattern, we can define the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word a number of times equal to the number of syllables in that word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" seems to translate consistently to the color ""green."" Here is how the correspondence can be inferred from each example:

- In the first example, ""zup lug zup wif dax"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow red green."" Here, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- In the second example, ""lug dax"" translates directly to ""blue green,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to blue and ""dax"" to green.
- The third example includes other words such as ""wif"" and ""walm,"" which correspond to red and yellow, respectively. Regardless of their placement, ""dax"" still corresponds to green.
- The fourth example shows ""dax"" in a different position, between ""lug"" (blue) and ""walm"" (yellow yellow yellow), yet ""dax"" still results in green.
- The fifth example simply has ""dax bluf,"" where ""bluf"" seems to correspond to green, as does ""dax."" 

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples given, each instance of the word ""wif"" corresponds to a single occurrence of the color ""red"" in the output. There is no evident variation in this rule dependent on the context — the word ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.

Rule:
wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, each instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output. It does not seem to change regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is consistent and does not depend on the context in the given examples.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to the last color word used before it. 

Here is the breakdown of the examples provided:

1. lug dax bluf -> blue green green (bluf represents the color mentioned right before it, green)
2. zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow (bluf represents the color mentioned right before it, yellow)
3. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue (bluf represents the color mentioned right before it, blue)
4. zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green green red (bluf represents the color mentioned right before it, green)
5. dax bluf -> green green (bluf represents the color mentioned right before it, green)

Rule: bluf -> the color word that immediately precedes it.
Based on the provided examples, the repetition of a color three times seems to correspond to the nonce word ""walm"". Each unique input word (wif, dax, zup, lug) is associated with a different color (red, green, yellow, and blue respectively) whenever they appear. When ""walm"" follows any of these words, the color corresponding to that word is repeated three times.

Here is how ""walm"" operates for each word:

1. wif walm -> red red red (wif corresponds to red, walm repeats the color thrice)
2. dax walm -> green green green (dax corresponds to green, walm repeats the color thrice)
3. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow (zup corresponds to yellow, walm repeats the color thrice)
4. lug walm -> blue blue blue (lug corresponds to blue, walm repeats the color thrice)

Hence, the rule for walm seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: When the word ""lug"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green

Each instance of ""dax"" consistently correlates with the output ""green,"" regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the presence of other nonce words around it.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" In each example, whenever the word ""wif"" is present, the output includes ""red."" 

Here are the associations from the examples:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red,"" indicating that ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""bluf"" is also ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" by itself corresponds to a single ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" appears at the end and corresponds to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is the first word and it corresponds to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif dax"" corresponds to ""red green,"" clearly indicating that ""wif"" is ""red.""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
bluf -> meaning. The word bluf translates to the color red if the word immediately before it is wif, and to the same color as the word before it if the preceding word is not wif. Rule: If preceded by ""wif,"" output ""red,"" else repeat the color of the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the output color associated with the nonce word ""walm"" is duplicated thrice, and the color that appears is determined by the preceding word. Analyzing the examples:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times.
- Similarly, ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and ""walm"" repeats it threefold.
- Again, ""lug wif dax zup walm"" results in ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow,"" which means after ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax,"" corresponding to blue, red, and green respectively, ""zup"" follows with its associated color yellow, and ""walm"" multiplies it by three.
- ""dax walm"" giving ""green green green"" confirms that ""dax"" corresponds to green, with ""walm"" again tripling the occurrence.
- Finally, ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" which outputs ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue,"" confirms the patterns established before: ""wif"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" has no output (possibly a misprint or irrelevant to the rule), ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" once again repeats the preceding color three times.

Rule: walm -> When walm follows a word, it repeats the color associated with that word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each of the given examples.
Based on the examples given, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" There is no example where ""dax"" leads to any other color. Therefore, the rule we can deduce is that ""dax"" means green.

Rule: dax -> green.
Observing the examples:

1. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   
2. Input: lug wif
   Output: blue red

3. Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup
   Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow

4. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

5. Input: dax bluf wif lug
   Output: green green red blue

We can notice that in each output, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" In example 2, we see ""wif"" immediately following ""lug"" which translates to ""blue,"" and the output confirms ""wif"" as ""red."" This pattern is consistent throughout the examples presented:

1. ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" (translation: blue), result is ""red red"" so ""wif"" is ""red.""
2. ""lug"" (translation: blue) followed by ""wif"" has the output ""blue red,"" again suggesting ""wif"" is ""red.""
3. ""wif"" is surrounded by ""bluf lug"" (translation: blue blue) and ""lug bluf"" (blue blue), and in the output, ""wif"" is ""red"" in the corresponding position.
4. Regardless of the preceding or succeeding words (""dax zup walm,"" translation: green yellow yellow), ""wif"" results in ""red.""
5. Even when the sequences change, ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red.
From the given examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" translates to the word ""yellow."" The color yellow is consistently mentioned in the output each time ""zup"" appears in the input. Here is the rule based on the examples provided:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the provided examples and identify patterns that associate with the occurrences of the word ""bluf.""

From the first example:
- Input: zup wif bluf
- Output: yellow red red

From the second example:
- Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
- Output: blue red green green red blue

From the third example:
- Input: wif bluf
- Output: red red

From the fourth example:
- Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
- Output: red blue blue red yellow

From the fifth example:
- Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
- Output: red green red red yellow red

Reviewing these examples, we can observe the following:
1. In each case, ""bluf"" is followed by the color ""red"" in the output.
2. When ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" it is translated as ""red red."" This indicates that ""bluf"" might simply translate to ""red"" and ""wif"" might translate to ""red"" by itself as well.
3. When ""bluf"" occurs between other words (such as ""lug"" or ""dax"") that correspond to other colors, it is always represented as ""red"" in the output.

By analyzing these patterns, we can infer that regardless of its position or the words around it, ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.

Rule: bluf -> red
Walm -> repeats the color correlated with the preceding word. Rule: The output color is repeated as many times as the length of the word ""walm."" For example, ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" and the word ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times, as ""walm"" is four letters long but seems to always subtract one from its length.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to the output ""blue"" regardless of its position or neighboring words. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds directly to the color ""green"" in every instance. Here is the rule that I have deduced:

Rule: dax -> green

The meaning is consistent regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the sequence or the other words that surround it.
wif -> red

Rule: The word wif translates to the color red.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" contributes to the output string by adding the word ""yellow"" at its position. To verify this, let's examine the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. wif zup walm dax zup -> red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
Here, ""wif"" and ""dax"" result in ""red"" and ""green,"" respectively. ""walm"" results in double ""yellow."" ""zup"" appears twice and there are two single ""yellow"" appearing in the output associated with each occurrence of ""zup.""

2. lug zup -> blue yellow
""lug"" results in ""blue,"" followed by ""zup,"" which results in ""yellow.""

3. wif walm zup lug zup walm -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
Here, ""wif"" and ""walm"" result in ""red"" and ""red red,"" while ""lug"" gives ""blue."" Each ""zup"" is followed by a single ""yellow,"" and an additional ""yellow"" follows the second ""walm,"" consistent with its previous output.

4. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
""zup"" is at the start and is followed by ""yellow,"" and ""walm,"" as before, results in double ""yellow.""

5. dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green
""dax"" results in green, followed by ""zup,"" which results in ""yellow,"" and then another ""dax"" followed by ""green."" The last ""walm"" once again leads to triple ""green.""

Accordingly, ""zup"" consistently adds a single ""yellow"" to the sequence, regardless of its position in the input string.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be a function that replicates the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. We can derive this rule from observing the pattern of outputs corresponding to the word that comes before ""bluf"" in each input:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow,"" followed by the color blue for ""lug.""
- In the third example, we see ""dax"" before ""bluf"" again, leading to ""green green,"" followed by blue for ""lug"" and red for ""wif.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" again, yielding ""yellow yellow,"" with subsequent colors matching their associated words (""wif"" is red, ""dax"" is green, and ""zup"" is yellow).
- Finally, the fifth example shows ""lug"" before ""bluf,"" resulting in ""blue blue,"" in line with the established rule.

Rule: bluf -> Replicates the color associated with the immediate preceding word.
Observing the examples provided:

1. When the input sentence contains the word ""walm,"" each color word that follows it is tripled in the output.
2. If ""walm"" appears after a color word in the input, the output color word corresponding to that input color word is tripled.
3. If ""walm"" appears alone after ""dax,"" it results in ""green"" being repeated three times.

Assessment of each input-output pair:

- Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
  Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
  The word ""wif"" results in ""red,"" while ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" and ""zup"" results in ""yellow."" When ""walm"" appears, the previously mentioned color is repeated two more times, leading to three instances of that color overall.

- Input: dax walm
  Output: green green green
  The word ""dax"" translates to ""green."" After ""walm"" appears, ""green"" is repeated twice more, totaling three times.

- Input: lug walm wif bluf
  Output: blue blue blue red red
  The word ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" After ""walm"" appears, ""blue"" is repeated twice more, totaling three times. ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" which appears twice due to ""bluf"" in the input, but ""bluf"" does not seem to relate directly to ""walm.""

- Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
  Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
  The word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" After ""walm"" appears, ""yellow"" is repeated twice more, totaling three times. The pattern continues with other colors accordingly.

- Input: zup dax walm zup wif
  Output: yellow green green green yellow red
  The words ""zup"" and ""dax"" translate to ""yellow"" and ""green"" respectively. After ""walm"" appears, ""green"" is repeated twice more, totaling three times.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that the word ""walm"" causes the color word that precedes it to be outputted two additional times, making the color appear a total of three times consecutively. If ""walm"" appears with no preceding color word, it repeats the color word of the preceding color-associated word three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"":
Walm -> Causes the preceding color word to be outputted two additional times, totaling three consecutive instances of that color. If ""walm"" stands alone following a word that translates to a color, that color is outputted three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
Rule: dax -> green

The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the provided examples.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"", let's look at how it affects the output in each example:

- Every time “wif” appears in the input, “red” is the corresponding output color.
- The word “wif” doesn’t seem to affect the output of the words that follow it in any distinguishable pattern.

Now, let's briefly analyze the other recurring words in the context of their outputs:

- “zup” consistently leads to the output “yellow.”
- “walm” results in a sequence of “yellow” colors equal to the number of times it has appeared in sequence plus one. For instance, one ""walm"" results in two ""yellow"" outputs, but when it is preceded by ""wif"", the sequence starts with ""red"" followed by ""yellow"" colors.
- “dax” leads to the output “green.”
- “lug” maps to the output “blue.”

Given the observed pattern for ""wif"", we can articulate the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""wif"" as follows:

Rule: wif -> The word ""wif"" maps to ""red"" in the output, irrespective of its position in the input sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"", regardless of its position in the sequence or the context of other words around it.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" Every instance where ""bluf"" appears, the following pattern can be observed:

- ""dax bluf"" outputs ""green green,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" may also mean ""green.""
- ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow red green red red,"" and here ""bluf"" seems to follow ""wif,"" which has already been established as ""red,"" so ""bluf"" may take on the color of the preceding word.
- ""zup bluf wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow red red,"" which also suggests that ""bluf"" assumes the color of the preceding word ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- ""dax bluf wif"" outputs ""green green red,"" again showing ""bluf"" as ""green,"" following the color of ""dax.""
- ""zup wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow red red,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""

Considering these observations, we can conclude that the nonce word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the immediately preceding word.

Rule: bluf means the same as the color word before it. If there is no color word before, then it defaults to red, as seen in the second example where ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" which is red.

bluf -> the same color as the preceding color word (default to red if there's no preceding color word).
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond to repeating the color of the word that precedes it, three times. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green,"" because ""dax"" translates to ""green."" Similarly, when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red,"" since ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever we see ""lug"" in the input, it corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence. 

Based on the input-output pairs, it seems that other words might correspond to other colors. ""wif"" seems to be associated with the color red, ""bluf"" with green, ""zup"" with yellow, and ""lug"" with blue. However, since the task is to deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" the rule that ""dax"" means green holds, irrespective of other words present in the sequence.
Using the provided examples, we can try to deduce what ""wif"" means in relation to the output colors.

1. Input: zup bluf wif -> Output: yellow yellow red
2. Input: wif -> Output: red
3. Input: zup walm wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow red
4. Input: wif dax -> Output: red green
5. Input: lug zup dax wif zup -> Output: blue yellow green red yellow

Analyzing these examples, it seems that every occurrence of ""wif"" within an input is associated with the output color ""red."" No matter the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence, the output sequence always contains ""red"" in the position that corresponds to where ""wif"" appeared. This implies that ""wif"" correlates directly with the color ""red.""

Based on this analysis, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Therefore, wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" is consistently translated to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words surrounding it.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to repeating the color that corresponds with the word just before it. We can deduce this because every time ""bluf"" is used in an example, the color that is outputted after ""bluf"" is the same as the color that is outputted for the word that precedes ""bluf"". 

Here is the breakdown for each example:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"", and the word after ""bluf"" is ""red"" again.
- In the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and after ""bluf"" we see ""red"" repeated.
- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and after ""bluf"" we see ""green"" once more.
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and after ""bluf"" we see ""yellow"" repeated.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so after ""bluf"" we see ""yellow"", and after a second instance of ""bluf"", we still see ""yellow"".

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word.
Considering the examples given, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be linked to repeating the color associated with the word that comes directly before it. Each example shows ""walm"" outputting multiple instances of the color word that directly precedes it.

In more detail:

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red"". ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" creates two more instances of ""red"".
- In the second example, ""dax lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", so following ""walm"" we get three more instances of ""blue"".
- In the third example, ""dax wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" results in three additional instances of ""red"".
- In the fourth example, the last ""lug"" before ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" causes three more ""blue"" to appear.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""walm"" produces three more ""green"".

Thus the rule seems to be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color given by the word that comes directly before it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Based on the provided examples, the following rule can be deduced:

Rule:
- The word ""dax"" translates to ""green"" consistently in each example, regardless of its position in the input sentence.

Thus:
dax -> green
wif -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:

wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
From examining the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red in the output. In every instance where ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. 

However, various other words correspond to different colors, and their position in the input does not seem to affect their corresponding color in the output:

- ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green.""
- ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red,"" just like ""bluf.""

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
Based on the examples provided, each input word corresponds to a specific output color. The word dax consistently results in the output of green, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Therefore, we can deduce that in this context, dax directly translates to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can infer that ""wif"" corresponds consistently to the color ""red."" There does not appear to be any additional context affecting this mapping, as ""wif"" retains its meaning regardless of its position within the input sequence or the presence of other words.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" can be determined by examining the consistent output corresponding to its presence in the input.

In each example where ""zup"" appears, the output consistently contains the color ""yellow."" Furthermore, the word ""zup"" is not followed by any specific word that may alter its meaning. Therefore, the rule can be established as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the repetitions of colors after each appearance of the word ""walm"" in the given examples. 

- When ""walm"" appears after ""wif"", the output is three reds.
- When ""walm"" appears after ""zup"", the output is three yellows.
- When ""walm"" appears after ""dax"", the output is three greens.
- When ""walm"" appears after ""lug"", the output is three blues.

In the instances where ""walm"" appears, it causes the output of three of the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it. Here is how the rule can be formally stated:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it three times.

So, walm -> causes the repetition of the prior color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow yellow blue,True,120
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated as ""blue"" in each provided example.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer that the meaning of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

The following are the observations that lead us to this conclusion:
- When ""dax"" appears on its own, the output is ""green.""
- Whenever ""dax"" appears in different combinations, the corresponding output always includes ""green.""

Therefore, the inference is as follows:

dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we observe that the word ""wif"" produces the output ""red"" consistently, regardless of its position in the input sequence. The other words in the input sequence correspond to unique colors that are not altered by the presence of the word ""wif.""

Rule:
wif -> red
zup -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, where every instance of ""zup"" corresponds to an output of ""yellow,"" the rule appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> red
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the word following it, unless the word is 'wif', in which case output 'red'. If there is no following word, repeat the color of the last word before 'walm'.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    ",Output: yellow yellow blue blue red red red yellow green,yellow yellow yellow blue blue blue red yellow green,False,121
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Other words correspond to different colors (e.g., ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"").
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of ""dax"":

Rule:
- dax -> green

Every instance of ""dax"" in the examples corresponds to the output ""green."" There is a direct mapping from ""dax"" to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word corresponds to a particular color. According to the pattern, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Here's how:

- In each instance where ""zup"" appears, the output includes the color ""yellow.""
- ""zup"" does not appear to alter its meaning based on its position in the input sequence; it consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end of the sequence.

So, the rule seems to be:

zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" correlates with a color that repeats the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it.

Here's how this plays out in the examples:

- In the first input, every time ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the color blue is repeated.
- In the second input, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" and the color yellow is repeated.
- In the third input, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the color red is repeated.
- In the fourth input, ""bluf"" is after ""dax,"" and the color green is repeated.
- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" so the color blue is repeated again.

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" means to repeat the color indicated by the word immediately before it. Thus:

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color mentioned before ""bluf"".
walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word. Rule: The color associated with the word directly before walm is repeated three times in the output. 

- dax -> green 
- zup bluf wif -> yellow yellow red
- lug -> blue 
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue

For instance, in ""dax walm,"" dax corresponds to green, so the output is ""green green green."" Similarly, in ""zup bluf wif walm,"" the last color word before walm is wif, which corresponds to red, hence ""red red red.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in the provided examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each unique word corresponds to a unique color. For example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and so on. The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Thus, the rule is: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" consistently correlates with the color ""yellow"" regardless of the context in which it is used. As such, the rule appears to be straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Meaning: The word ""zup"" means yellow.
To determine the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine each input with its corresponding output:

1. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

2. Input: lug wif lug bluf
   Output: blue red blue blue

3. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue

4. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

5. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green

Based on the outputs, it appears that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word right before it:

1. ""dax"" is associated with ""green."" Since ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""
2. ""lug"" is associated with ""blue."" ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" so the output is ""blue,"" and there are two instances of ""blue"" due to the two occurrences of ""lug"" before ""bluf.""
3. Again, ""lug"" is paired with ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" resulting in ""blue blue.""
4. ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and ""bluf"" comes after it, so the output is ""red red."" There are three ""green"" before those because of ""dax"" and ""walm,"" but ""bluf"" is only repeating the color right before it.
5. ""dax"" is linked with ""green,"" and ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" leading to ""green green."" The ""red"" in the output corresponds to ""wif.""

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word right before it.
walm -> repeats the color of the previous word. Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears, it takes on the color of the word immediately before it and repeats that color for as many times as ""walm"" is repeated, until another word with a defined color appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,123
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, each nonce word seems to correspond to a color. Here are the observed associations:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue""

So in the context of these examples, when ""lug"" appears, it translates to ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Thus, the rule can be deduced as follows:

dax -> green

Rule: When the word ""dax"" appears in the input, it translates to ""green"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" seems to correspond with the color red. This can be deduced by looking at the first instance of ""wif"" in each input and the corresponding position in the output:

Input: zup walm lug wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red  
Input: wif bluf lug zup -> Output: red red blue yellow  
Input: wif dax zup dax -> Output: red green yellow green  
Input: zup wif dax -> Output: yellow red green  
Input: wif dax -> Output: red green  

In all cases, the position of ""wif"" in input matches the position of the color ""red"" in the output. There are no examples that contradict this.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" It precedes other words that correspond to different colors, and regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""zup"" consistently outputs ""yellow."" Here is the rule based on the examples:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
From the examples provided, we can infer that ""bluf"" repeats the color word or color association that comes directly before it. Here's the breakdown:

In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and following ""bluf,"" we get another ""blue.""

In the second example, the pattern is the same. ""Bluf"" comes after ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" and thus ""bluf"" translates to another ""blue.""

In the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" repeats the color before it which is ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and ""green"" for ""dax.""

In the fifth example, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" which is ""red,"" and therefore it repeats the color ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> The same color as the color-word immediately preceding it.

Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. Therefore, we can derive the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color denoted by the word immediately prior to 'walm' three times.

Let's confirm this rule with the given examples:

1. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - 'zup' corresponds to yellow, followed by 'walm', which repeats yellow three times.

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - 'wif' corresponds to red, followed by 'walm', which repeats red three times.

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - 'dax' corresponds to green, followed by 'walm', which repeats green three times.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - 'zup' corresponds to yellow, followed by 'walm', which repeats yellow three times.

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - 'lug' corresponds to blue, followed by 'walm', which repeats blue three times.

Hence, the rule is validated by each example.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug
    ",Output: yellow blue,yellow blue,True,124
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the other words present, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in each given example.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow in every example given.
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""red"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided. Notice that whenever ""walm"" appears, it influences the output by adding extra instances of the color word that comes right before it in the output. 

Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

In the above sequence, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. After ""zup,"" the word ""walm"" appears which results in two additional yellows in the output.

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""lug walm,"" we see two additional blues.

3. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Again, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in two more blues in the sequence. And ""wif"" corresponds to red.

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" leading to two additional reds before the sequence continues with ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

5. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

Here, ""zup"" comes before ""walm,"" which causes two extra yellows in the output sequence.

Rule:
Based on the given examples, we can induce the rule that the word ""walm"" causes the color word that appears before it to repeat two additional times in the output. So if ""color X"" is the word before ""walm,"" the output will have ""color X color X color X"".

walm -> meaning: Repeat the previous color word twice more in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue.

Rule: lug = blue
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input list.
According to the provided examples, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red every time it appears. It is independent of the position in the sequence and the other words around it. 

Therefore, the rule is: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color green.

Here is the reasoning for this deduction:

- Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- The occurrence of ""bluf"" is independent of its position in the input sequence.
- Other words in the inputs seem to correspond to other colors, and ""bluf"" consistently maps to the same color, regardless of the surrounding words.

Rule: bluf -> green
From the given examples, we can try to deduce the rule that governs the meaning of the word ""walm."" Here are the outputs corresponding to inputs with and without the word ""walm"":

- When ""walm"" is present, the color that is repeated is the same as the color corresponding to the word right before ""walm.""
- When ""walm"" is not present, each word corresponds to a specific color without repetition.

Let's analyze each input and corresponding output:

1. Input: ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup""
   Output: ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""lug"" to blue.
   - After ""wif walm,"" red is repeated three times.
   - After ""wif walm zup,"" the pattern starts again with ""yellow.""
   - ""Walm"" after the second ""wif"" again causes red to repeat three times, followed by ""zup,"" which is yellow.

2. Input: ""wif lug walm""
   Output: ""red blue blue blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""lug"" to blue.
   - After ""lug walm,"" blue is repeated three times.

3. Input: ""dax lug walm""
   Output: ""green blue blue blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""lug"" to blue.
   - After ""lug walm,"" blue is repeated three times.

4. Input: ""dax walm""
   Output: ""green green green""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - After ""dax walm,"" green is repeated three times.

5. Input: ""dax walm zup""
   Output: ""green green green yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""zup"" to yellow.
   - After ""dax walm,"" green is repeated three times, and then ""zup"" is yellow.

From these observations, we can deduce:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to repeat three times.

Therefore:

Walm -> meaning. Meaning: Walm causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in all provided examples.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" seems to correspond to the color ""red"". Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the same position in the output. 

The following rule can, therefore, be deduced:

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
From the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds with a color that is the same as the color associated with the word that precedes it.

For every example, the color associated with ""bluf"" is the same as the color associated with the word right before it:

- In the first example: ""wif"" corresponds to red, and when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red.
- In the second and third examples: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is yellow.
- In the fourth example: ""wif"" corresponds to red, and when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red.
- In the fifth example: ""dax"" corresponds to green, and when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green.

Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the word that comes before bluf.
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a sequence of colors where ""walm"" always results in ""blue blue blue"". No matter what the context or the surrounding words, whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the output consistently contains three instances of the word ""blue"".

Here's the breakdown of each example:

- In the context ""wif walm dax zup,"" ""walm"" generates ""blue blue blue"" between ""red"" (from ""wif"") and ""green yellow"" (from ""dax zup"").
- In ""lug walm zup lug walm,"" ""walm"" appears twice and each time it is followed by ""blue blue blue,"" each preceded by a ""blue"" (from ""lug"").
- When ""walm"" is present with no other context, such as ""lug walm,"" it again results in ""blue blue blue.""
- Similarly, ""dax lug walm"" and ""lug wif walm"" include ""blue blue blue"" for ""walm"" and the appropriate colors for ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" in the input corresponds to ""blue blue blue"" in the output.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in all the examples provided. Each mention of ""lug"" in the input results in ""blue"" appearing in the output, regardless of its position relative to other words.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the consistency of the surrounding words and their corresponding outputs.

1. Whenever the word ""dax"" is present, the color ""green"" is in the output.
2. The word ""dax"" does not appear to influence the colors that come before it or after it.
3. The word ""dax"" always corresponds to a single color, ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Based on these observations, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" seems to be:

dax -> green

Rule: ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in the output. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" can be determined as:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" when following the word ""lug"" and ""yellow"" when following the word ""zup."" However, when it follows the word ""wif"" or a sequence involving ""wif,"" it corresponds to ""green."" Here are the rules deduced:

- When ""bluf"" directly follows ""lug,"" output is blue.
- When ""bluf"" directly follows ""zup,"" output is yellow.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (directly or after some other words) in a sequence, the output is green.

Given these observations, the rule can be summarized as:

Rule: bluf -> blue if preceded by lug, yellow if preceded by zup, green if in a sequence that includes wif.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to examine the patterns and outputs of each example given.

Example 1:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Example 2:
Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue

Example 3:
Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Example 4:
Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Example 5:
Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

In every example, the word ""walm"" results in an output of a color being repeated three times. The color that is repeated corresponds to the preceding word.

Example 1: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" we get ""blue"" three times.
Example 2: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" we get ""red"" three times.
Example 3: ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated.
Example 4: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" we get ""yellow"" three times.
Example 5: Confirming this pattern, after ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue"") and ""walm,"" we get ""blue"" repeated three times.

Based on this analysis, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the previous word to be repeated three times.

So we can deduce:

walm -> Repeats the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position or the context within the given examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Using the given examples, we can infer the following rule:

1. ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
2. ""wif"" when followed by a color word (e.g., ""bluf"" for ""red"" or ""zup"" for ""yellow""), it repeats the color of the word that follows it. 
3. ""wif"" when not followed by any color word (as in ""wif walm""), translates to ""red.""
4. In ""lug wif dax,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and since ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" which we know is ""green,"" ""wif"" in this context again translates to ""green.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be:

Rule: wif duplicates the color of the following word if it's a color word; if there's no color word after wif or it is used at the end, it translates to ""red."" 

Therefore:

wif -> meaning. The meaning of ""wif"" depends on the context: If followed by a word that is assigned a color, it takes on that color; otherwise, it defaults to the color ""red.""
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"". Therefore, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Meaning: ""zup"" means the color yellow.
Based on the examples provided, ""bluf"" seems to cause the output color to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""wif bluf zup"" -> ""red red yellow"": ""bluf"" repeats the color for ""wif,"" which is red.
2. ""zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow yellow blue"": ""bluf"" repeats the color for ""zup,"" which is yellow.
3. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"": ""bluf"" repeats the color for ""zup,"" which is yellow.
4. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green"": ""bluf"" repeats the color for ""wif,"" which is red and then ""dax"" changes the color to green and ""walm"" which also appears to be green doesn't change the pattern.
5. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"": ""bluf"" repeats the color for ""dax,"" which is green.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color of the word immediately before it.
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" is influenced by the color word that precedes it. The pattern indicates that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it a certain number of times.

From the examples:

- ""wif dax zup walm"" results in ""red green yellow yellow yellow"". ""Walm"" followed ""zup"" (yellow) and we got three yellows.
- ""lug walm"" yields ""blue blue blue"". ""Walm"" followed ""lug"" (blue) and we got three blues.
- ""zup dax lug walm zup"" gives ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow"". ""Walm"" followed ""lug"" (blue) and we got three blues.
- ""lug walm zup"" produces ""blue blue blue yellow"". ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and results in three blues followed by the next color word ""zup"" (yellow).
- ""lug dax walm wif"" leads to ""blue green green green red"". ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and we got three greens followed by the next color word ""wif"" (red).

Rule: walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif zup bluf
    ",Output: green green yellow yellow yellow,green red yellow yellow,False,129
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, each instance of a unique word translates to a unique color. The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: When the nonce word ""wif"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, where ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow"", the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: The word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. 

For Example:
- ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and ""bluf"" repeats that color.
- Similarly, ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"" since ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, and ""bluf"" repeats it.

Hence the rule for ""bluf"" is that it duplicates the color associated with the preceding word. 

bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
From the examples provided, it appears that the word 'walm' corresponds to repetition of the color that comes before it three times. Therefore, we can state:

walm -> meaning

Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color word that immediately precedes it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug bluf dax
    ",Output: blue blue green,blue blue green,True,130
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the given examples, where ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue,"" the rule is:

Rule: lug means blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The term ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in each given example, regardless of its position within the sequence of words.
Based on the examples provided, each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" There doesn't seem to be any other context affecting this mapping, as ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of position or surrounding words. So, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" When ""zup"" is present in the input, the corresponding output includes the color ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is as follows:
zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, each word seems to correspond to a specific color:

- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

The word ""bluf"" appears multiple times and each time it appears, it takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

- In ""dax zup bluf"", ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""zup"", which is yellow.
- In ""wif bluf lug dax wif"", ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""wif"", which is red.
- In ""lug wif bluf"", ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""wif"", which is red.
- In ""zup bluf"", ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""zup"", which is yellow.
- In ""dax lug bluf dax"", ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""lug"", which is blue.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.
In analyzing the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to affect the output sequence's length and color repetition. The examples show the following pattern:

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
- The word 'lug' must correspond to the color 'blue', and the presence of 'walm' repeats the color corresponding to the word right before it multiple times (three times in this case).

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
- 'wif' likely corresponds to 'red', and 'dax' to 'green'. The 'walm' inserted between 'wif' and 'dax' results in 'wif' (red) being repeated three times before 'dax' (green) appears. 

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
- With 'dax' first, it starts with 'green', followed by 'wif' which is 'red'. Again, 'walm' repeats the color corresponding to the word right before it multiple times (three times in this instance).

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow
- Here, 'wif' is followed by 'red' again, and 'zup' correlates with 'yellow'. As before, 'walm' repeats 'red' before 'zup' (yellow) appears.

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green
- Each word corresponds to a color ('lug' -> blue, 'zup' -> yellow, 'dax' -> green), and 'walm' causes the color before it (green) to be repeated multiple times (three times here).

Based on the above examples and analysis, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Walm -> Repeats the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

Rule: When walm appears in the sequence, take the color assigned to the directly preceding word and output that color three additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,131
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Rule: dax -> ""green"" 

Each instance of the word ""dax"" in the inputs correlates directly with the output ""green."" Regardless of its position or the words that accompany it, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word 'wif,' let's examine the patterns of occurrence and corresponding outputs for each example provided.

1. In the first example, 'wif' appears at the beginning and towards the end:
   Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   
   Here, 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red.'

2. In the second example, 'wif' appears at the beginning:
   Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   
   Again, the first 'wif' corresponds to 'red.'

3. In the third example, 'wif' appears at both ends:
   Input: wif zup lug wif
   Output: red yellow blue red
   
   Both instances of 'wif' map to 'red.'

4. In the fourth example, 'wif' appears at the beginning:
   Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   
   The 'wif' corresponds to 'red.'

5. In the fifth example, 'wif' is in the middle:
   Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
   Output: yellow yellow red blue green
   
   The 'wif' corresponds to 'red.'

Based on these observations, it appears that the nonce word 'wif' consistently maps to the color 'red,' regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore,

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output:

zup -> yellow

Rule: When the input contains ""zup"", the output will include the color yellow for each occurrence of ""zup"".
Based on the provided examples, we can infer that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red"". However, this translation depends on the context—particularly the word that appears immediately before ""bluf"". In the examples, when ""bluf"" follows different words, it produces different outputs:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow yellow"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue blue"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red"".

This suggests that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that comes before it. To confirm this rule, let's review the examples:

- In the input ""zup bluf"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""yellow"".
- In the input ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", it outputs ""red"". Similarly, when ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" again, it outputs ""blue"".
- In the input ""wif bluf lug dax wif"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" following ""wif"" outputs ""red"". ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", but it does not directly precede ""bluf"" here, so its color does not affect ""bluf"".
- In the input ""lug bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" following ""lug"" outputs ""blue"".
- In ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" that follows outputs ""red"".

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word before it three times. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and when ""walm"" follows, the output is ""red red red.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue."" It does not follow ""wif"" here, so ""red"" isn't repeated.
- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" following ""dax"" results in ""green green green.""
- The fourth example is similar to the third; ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" which gives ""green green green.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows both ""dax"" and ""zup."" Consequently, we see ""green green green"" after ""dax"" and ""yellow yellow yellow"" after ""zup.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,132
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" correlates to the color blue in the output. For each instance of ""lug"" in the input, there is a corresponding ""blue"" in the output. Other words correlate with other colors, for example, ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" and ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""

Here is how the rule can be stated:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green. Rule: Each unique nonce word is associated with a specific color. ""dax"" consistently translates to green, ""wif"" to red, ""walm"" to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""lug"" to blue.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
Rule: zup -> repeat the color associated with the next word. The next word determines the color to be repeated three times if it precedes a word, and two times if it is the final word in the sequence.
Observing the patterns and colors associated with the nonce word ""bluf"" and its position in the input sequences, we can attempt to deduce its meaning or the rule it follows. Let's analyze each input and its corresponding output to find a consistent pattern.

1. Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red
2. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> Output: blue green green yellow blue red
3. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax -> Output: red yellow yellow red green
4. Input: lug bluf -> Output: blue blue
5. Input: zup wif bluf zup -> Output: yellow red red yellow

Considering these examples, bluf seems to repeat the color of the word that comes directly before it. For instance:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which outputs ""red."" Therefore, ""bluf"" also outputs ""red.""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which outputs ""blue."" Therefore, ""bluf"" outputs ""blue.""
- The concept is further supported in example 2, where ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and both output ""green,"" and so on for the rest of the examples.

Rule: bluf -> The output color for ""bluf"" is the same as the color output by the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""
Based on the given examples, we can observe that the output color following 'walm' corresponds to the color of the word preceding 'walm'. Let's go through the examples to identify the pattern:

1. Input: dax walm zup -> Output: green green green yellow
   - 'dax' produces 'green', and the first 'walm' after 'dax' also produces 'green'. 'zup' then produces 'yellow'.

2. Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
   - 'zup' produces 'yellow', 'wif' produces 'red', and 'walm' after 'wif' also produces 'red'.

3. Input: lug walm dax -> Output: blue blue blue green
   - 'lug' produces 'blue', and the 'walm' after 'lug' also produces 'blue'. 'dax' then produces 'green'.

4. Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red
   - 'dax' produces 'green', and the 'walm' after 'dax' also produces 'green'. 'wif' then produces 'red'.

5. Input: lug wif zup wif walm -> Output: blue red yellow red red red
   - 'lug' produces 'blue', 'wif' produces 'red', 'zup' produces 'yellow', the second 'wif' produces another 'red', and 'walm' after 'wif' also produces 'red'.

The rule we can infer here is:

walm -> replicates the color output of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: If a word ""X"" is followed by the nonce word ""walm"", the color output for ""walm"" will be the same as the color output for ""X"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow,yellow yellow yellow,True,133
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the given context.
Based on the given examples, we can see that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position within the input sequence. There's a one-to-one correspondence between the input ""dax"" and the output ""green."" Therefore, the rule derived from the examples is:

Rule: dax -> green.
Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following pattern for the nonce word ""bluf"" in relation to the other words and their corresponding colors:

- Each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- Each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- Each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" appears, it takes on the color that follows its appearance.

Let's examine the examples to understand the rule:

1. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" 

2. Input: zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to two occurrences of ""red.""

4. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which correlates with ""green.""

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" which correlates with ""green.""

Given this pattern, ""bluf"" seems to replicate the color of the word that follows it. If there is no word following ""bluf,"" as in the third example (where ""bluf"" occurs at the end), then ""bluf"" replicates the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the following word; if there is no following word, it takes the color of the preceding word.
In each example, the word ""walm"" appears to convert the subsequent series into a repeated color until a new color is mentioned.

- In the first example, ""dax"" is associated with green. When ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" every word following ""walm"" is green until the word ""lug"" is mentioned, which translates to yellow. Then ""dax"" appears again, resuming the green color.

- In the second example, the pattern continues - ""walm"" after ""dax"" continues the green until ""wif"" appears, which is red.

- In the third example, ""wif"" is red, ""lug"" is blue, then ""dax"" is green, followed by ""walm,"" which keeps the color green until the sequence changes.

- The fourth example starts with ""zup,"" which is yellow, followed by ""wif,"" which is red. After ""walm,"" the color remains red despite ""lug"" typically being blue, suggesting ""walm"" is keeping the color as red.

- In the fifth example, ""zup"" is yellow, and after ""walm,"" the sequence continues as yellow multiple times until ""dax"" changes it to green, followed by ""wif,"" which changes it to red.

So, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to continue until a new color is introduced. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Continue the previous color until a new color word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" seems consistent:

lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green."" Regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input string or the other words present, each occurrence of ""dax"" results in ""green"" in the output.

Here are the correlations identified from the inputs and outputs provided:

- Input: ""dax wif walm lug zup"" produces an output sequence where each word corresponds to a color (""dax"" to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""walm"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""blue""), followed by ""yellow,"" which does not directly correlate with any input word. Since ""dax"" appears once, it corresponds to the first ""green.""

- Input: ""dax walm"" includes ""dax"" and ""walm"" and corresponds to an output of three ""green."" Here, both ""dax"" and ""walm"" produce ""green,"" but without further examples, it is hard to determine if ""walm"" has a consistent output or if the repetition of ""green"" is specifically linked to these words appearing together.

- The single instances of ""dax"" in an input consistently produce a single ""green"" output.

Considering all this, the only consistent rule that can be induced from the given information is:

dax -> meaning. Rule: Every occurrence of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to analyze the given examples and look for patterns in the outputs that can relate to the word's use. The outputs are color responses to the inputs.

Looking at the first and third examples:
- ""dax bluf wif"" -> ""green green red""
- ""zup wif zup dax"" -> ""yellow red yellow green""

In both cases, ""dax"" precedes ""green"" and ""wif"" precedes ""red"". Therefore, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Analyzing the second example:
- ""wif dax"" -> ""red green""

Here, the pattern holds: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

In the fourth example:
- ""lug dax wif"" -> ""blue green red""

""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" further confirming the pattern.

Finally, in the fifth example:
- ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red""

Here, ""lug"" still corresponds to ""blue""; ""wif"" is consistent with ""red,"" but we also have ""walm,"" which has not occurred in previous examples. Each occurrence of ""walm"" corresponds to ""red."" While this does not directly impact the meaning of ""wif,"" it maintains consistency for ""wif"" being ""red.""

Rule:
wif -> red
To identify what the nonce word ""zup"" means, we have to analyze how it changes the output in each of the given examples. Let's look at each occurrence of ""zup"" and see how it gets translated in the output:

1. wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
2. dax bluf zup bluf dax -> green green yellow yellow green
3. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
4. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
5. wif zup -> red yellow

Each time ""zup"" appears in an input, the first color in the output immediately following it is ""yellow."" Additionally, there is no instance where ""zup"" is followed by any color other than ""yellow."" Because the output is a sequence of colors, we can deduce that ""zup"" is consistently translated to the color ""yellow"".

Hence, we can conclude the rule:

zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" from the given examples, let's look for patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs. We will compare the position where ""bluf"" occurs in the input and the color that corresponds to it in the output.

1. Input: zup dax **bluf** zup dax
   Output: yellow green **green** yellow green
   
2. Input: zup **bluf** wif dax lug
   Output: yellow **yellow** red green blue
   
3. Input: dax lug wif **bluf**
   Output: green blue red **red**
   
4. Input: wif **bluf**
   Output: red **red**
   
5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif **bluf**
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green **red** **red**

Now, let's analyze:

- In examples 3 and 4, ""bluf"" is at the end, and each time, the last color is ""red.""
- In example 2, ""bluf"" is second in the sequence, and the second color in the output is ""yellow.""
- In example 1, ""bluf"" sits in the third position, and the color is ""green,"" which is the same color repeated in the output.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" follows a series of words with the last being ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red,"" which is a double representation of the color assigned to ""wif.""

From this, it seems that ""bluf"" does not correspond to a single static color. Instead, ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. In other words, it duplicates the output color of the word before it.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the output color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""walm"". 

For instance:

- In ""lug zup dax walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and the output is ""green green green"".
- In ""lug walm wif lug bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and hence the output for ""walm"" is ""blue blue"".
- In ""dax walm"", we again see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and thus ""walm"" results in ""green green green"".
- In ""lug wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and the output for ""walm"" is ""red red red"".

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the color of the previous word to be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug
    ",Output: green blue,green blue,True,135
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the examples provided.
dax -> green. Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of the context or the words around it.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context within the sequence of words. Therefore, we can establish the following rule:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output at the exact position where ""zup"" was placed. 

For further clarity:
- For the input ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to the first ""yellow"" in the sequence and ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow.""
- In the input ""lug walm zup,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" while ""lug"" and ""walm"" both correspond to ""blue.""
- Regardless of what follows or precedes it, ""zup"" always maps to ""yellow"" in the output.

Hence the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Analyzing the provided input-output pairs, we can attempt to deduce the rule by which ""bluf"" is assigned a color in the outputs. Here is the analysis of each example:

- Input: wif bluf dax walm | Output: red red green green green
    ""wif"" leads to ""red"", ""dax"" and ""walm"" each lead to ""green"".

- Input: dax wif bluf | Output: green red red 
    ""dax"" leads to ""green"", ""wif"" leads to ""red"".

- Input: wif bluf dax | Output: red red green 
    The color sequence is the same as the previous example, with ""wif"" leading to ""red"", ""dax"" leading to ""green"".

- Input: zup dax bluf zup dax | Output: yellow green green yellow green
    Here, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" once again leads to ""green"".

- Input: dax zup bluf | Output: green yellow yellow
    As before, ""dax"" leads to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

From the observations above, we can see that ""bluf"" is not consistently leading to the same color output. However, it seems to follow a pattern where ""bluf"" takes the color of the word preceding it:

- In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and both are red.
- In the second and third examples, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and both are red.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", and both result in green; the same pattern is repeated for ""zup"" and yellow.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", and both result in yellow.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. If ""wif"" is red and comes before ""bluf"", ""bluf"" is red. If ""dax"" is green and comes before ""bluf"", ""bluf"" is green. If ""zup"" is yellow and comes before ""bluf"", ""bluf"" is yellow. Thus:

bluf -> meaning: Bluf takes the color of the preceding word.
walm -> tripling of the color that comes before it.

Rule: Whenever ""walm"" appears after a color, the output is that color repeated three times. If ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue"" three times; if it follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" three times; if it follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" three times; if it follows ""bluf,"" the output is ""green"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,136
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output. There is no indication that the meaning of ""lug"" changes depending on the context—it always corresponds to the same color in the output regardless of its position or the other words present.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"", regardless of its position in the sequence or the elements that come before or after it.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The word zup translates to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Therefore, ""bluf"" likely means ""red"".

Rule: bluf -> red.
Let's analyze the examples provided to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

- In every instance of ""walm"" in the input, the corresponding output is a sequence of three consecutive ""red.""
- The word ""walm"" does not seem to have any relation or dependency on the words that come before or after it in the input sequence.
- The effect of the word ""walm"" is consistent across all examples; it always translates to ""red red red"" in the output.

Considering this, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> three consecutive ""red"" in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" I will look at the position of ""dax"" in the input strings and the corresponding output colors, considering position and surrounding words.

1. In the first input/output pair (""dax lug dax lug wif"" -> ""green blue green blue red""), ""dax"" corresponds to green. Since ""lug"" follows ""dax"" each time and corresponds to blue, it suggests ""dax"" indicates green regardless of what follows.

2. In the second input/output pair (""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red""), ""dax"" again corresponds to green, even though the words ""wif"" and ""walm"" follow, suggesting other words have no effect on ""dax"" representing green.

3. The third pair (""dax zup wif zup"" -> ""green yellow red yellow"") reinforces that ""dax"" is green, despite the presence of other colors that come from the words ""zup"" and ""wif.""

4. Input four (""zup lug dax lug"" -> ""yellow blue green blue"") shows ""dax"" in the middle this time but still corresponds to green.

5. The fifth pair (""dax walm zup lug dax"" -> ""green green green yellow blue green"") shows ""dax"" at the beginning and end, both times corresponding to green.

From these examples, we can deduce that ""dax"" indicates the color green, irrespective of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words. 

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" acts as a duplicator for the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here’s how the rule applies in each example:

- Input: wif zup bluf -> Output: red yellow yellow 
    - ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""zup"" to yellow, and bluf duplicates the color of the word before it (yellow in this case).
- Input: lug dax bluf -> Output: blue green green 
    - ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""dax"" to green, and bluf duplicates the color of the word before it (green).
- Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green 
    - ""dax"" is green, and bluf duplicates green.
- Input: lug zup bluf dax -> Output: blue yellow yellow green 
    - ""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" is yellow, bluf duplicates yellow, and ""dax"" is green.
- Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green 
    - ""wif"" is red, bluf duplicates red, ""dax"" is green, and ""walm"" seems to duplicate green (although ""walm"" is not in focus for this rule induction exercise).

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color associated with the word that comes before it.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a repetition of the color that is produced by the word immediately preceding ""walm"". Here is the reasoning:

1. In the first example ""dax lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"". So, here ""walm"" repeats the color blue three times.
   
2. In the second example ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, ""dax"" to green, ""wif"" to red, and ""bluf"" to red red. ""Zup walm"" here leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"", illustrating that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"", which is yellow, three times.

3. Both the third and fourth examples ""zup walm"" again result in ""yellow yellow yellow"", reinforcing the rule that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

4. However, in the fifth example ""zup wif walm"", we have a slight change: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" to red, and ""walm"" here leads to ""red red red"", showing that ""walm"" has taken the latest color ""red"" from ""wif"" and repeated it three times.

Given these examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the immediately preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax
    ",Output: red yellow green,red yellow green,True,138
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the examples provided, every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the output color is determined by the position of the word in the sequence, and ""dax"" has a consistent output of green.

Rule:
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""walm"" -> green
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""bluf"" -> red
- ""lug"" -> blue

The rule is that each nonce word translates to a specific color output. In this case, ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples given, each non-nonce word seems to translate to a specific color each time it appears. In each instance, ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

Therefore, the induction rule is:

wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: In each example, whenever the word ""zup"" appears, the corresponding output is ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, we need to deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf.""

In the first example:
- Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
- Output: yellow blue red green green red

Here, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""green.""

In the second example:
- Input: lug wif lug bluf
- Output: blue red blue blue

Again, ""bluf"" correlates with the output ""blue.""

In the third example:
- Input: wif bluf dax walm
- Output: red red green green green

Here, ""bluf"" corresponds with the second ""green.""

In the fourth example:
- Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
- Output: yellow green green yellow green

Here, ""bluf"" is associated with the second ""green"" again.

In the fifth example:
- Input: wif bluf dax
- Output: red red green

Once more, ""bluf"" tunes with ""red.""

From the examples above, the word ""bluf"" does not consistently map to a single color in the output; however, we can observe a pattern. In each instance, ""bluf"" seems to take the color that is immediately before it. Therefore, we can deduce that ""bluf"" refers to the repeat of the previous color in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the color that precedes it.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" indicates repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it, three additional times. Here's the breakdown:

- In ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" After ""walm"" the sequence ""red red red"" appears.
- In ""zup wif walm,"" ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" which is then repeated thrice making ""red red red.""
- In ""lug wif walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and again ""red"" is then repeated three times as ""red red red.""
- In ""dax walm wif zup,"" ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" which is then repeated three times as ""green green green"" before moving on to the next colors.
- In ""lug walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" which is then repeated three times as ""blue blue blue.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Input: wif dax wif dax
    ",Output: red green red green,red green red green,True,139
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Each instance of ""lug"" in the input results in the word ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the presented examples, each instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green,"" regardless of its position within the input sequence or the presence of other words. The words ""walm"" and ""zup"" consistently correspond to the output ""yellow,"" while ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red."" The word ""bluf"" is only seen once, so while it corresponds to ""yellow,"" there is not enough information to conclude that it always does. For other words not seen in these examples, we cannot determine their corresponding output without additional data.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output. In all given instances, whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position within the input sequence. Thus, we can conclude that:

zup -> yellow. Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
bluf -> yellow

Rule: The word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the provided examples, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" is directly associated with repeating the color linked to the previous word. In each example, the output associated with ""walm"" consists of a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it.

For instance, in ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" elicits the color yellow, and ""walm"" following it leads to a repeated output of ""yellow."" Similarly, in ""dax walm wif zup,"" ""dax"" is associated with the color green, and following ""walm,"" there is a repetition of ""green"" until the next word changes the pattern. This rule holds across all the given examples.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" would be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it can be determined that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in every example it's used.

Rule: lug -> blue
From examining the input-output pairs, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" consistently, regardless of the context or the words surrounding it. Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be constant and not dependent on position or neighboring words.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by looking for patterns.

In every example, the word ""wif"" is associated with the color red in the output:

- Input: **wif** lug bluf **wif** zup -> Output: **red** blue blue **red** yellow
- Input: **wif** dax bluf -> Output: **red** green green
- Input: **wif** zup lug dax zup walm -> Output: **red** yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
- Input: dax bluf **wif** zup dax -> Output: green green **red** yellow green
- Input: zup **wif** zup dax -> Output: yellow **red** yellow green

We can see that regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input, it corresponds to the color red in the output. With this consistent pattern, we can conclude that the nonce word ""wif"" represents the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence of nonce words.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze where it appears and its corresponding output in each example:

1. ""zup bluf wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow red red""
2. ""lug wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue red blue blue""
3. ""lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue green green""
4. ""lug bluf dax lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue""
5. ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" -> ""green red green yellow yellow""

Observations:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""wif,"" outputting ""yellow"" after ""yellow"" and ""red"" after ""red."" This suggests that ""bluf"" could mirror the color of the preceding word.
- In example 2, ""bluf"" again mirrors the color of the preceding word ""lug,"" which outputs ""blue.""
- Example 3 reinforces the idea as ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" and both output ""green.""
- Example 4 is particularly telling because ""bluf"" comes immediately after ""lug,"" and both output ""blue."" It also comes before ""dax"" and ""lug,"" but the output corresponding to ""bluf"" is still ""blue,"" consistent with its immediate predecessor.
- Example 5 shows that ""bluf"" after ""zup"" results in another ""yellow,"" again mimicking the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf mirrors the color output of the word immediately preceding it.

Therefore: bluf -> the same color as the color output of the immediately preceding word.
From the given examples, we can notice the following patterns:

1. ""zup walm"" produces three repetitions of ""yellow."" This suggests that ""zup walm"" specifically means three yellows.
2. ""zup walm wif"" produces three yellows followed by a red. We know from the first example that ""zup walm"" yields three yellows, so the addition of ""wif"" results in a red.
3. ""wif walm dax zup"" produces three reds followed by a green and a yellow. We can infer that ""wif"" might be linked to red since it precedes the three reds. ""dax"" might be related to green, as it precedes the green. Lastly, ""zup"" is associated with yellow, consistent with previous examples.
4. ""wif walm zup"" produces three reds followed by a yellow. Again, we can confirm that ""wif"" is likely linked to red and ""zup"" to yellow.
5. ""lug walm"" results in three blues. This example confirms that ""lug"" correlates to blue.

Without any direct statement of what ""walm"" means, it appears that ""walm"" might signal the repetition of the color associated with the word placed directly before it. Therefore, ""walm"" indicates that the color produced by the preceding word should be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,141
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it is translated to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" represents a color. In each instance where ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"". Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"".

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

dax -> meaning. Meaning: ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"". Rule: When you see ""dax"", output ""green"".
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word zup translates to the color yellow regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can identify a pattern in which the word ""bluf"" is used. Each example shows that the output for ""bluf"" is repeated twice back-to-back with the same color that corresponds to the word just before ""bluf"".

Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   - ""dax"" correlates with ""green"", ""bluf"" follows with ""green green"".

2. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"", ""bluf"" follows with ""yellow yellow"".

3. Input: dax lug wif bluf
   Output: green blue red red
   - ""wif"" correlates with ""red"", ""bluf"" follows with ""red red"".

4. Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup
   Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow
   - First ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"", ""bluf"" follows with ""blue blue"".
   - The second ""lug"" again is ""blue"", followed by another ""bluf"" which results in ""blue blue"".
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"", and here ""bluf"" is not following ""zup"" directly so the rule does not apply to ""zup"".

So the rule for the word ""bluf"" seems to be: Repeat the color of the preceding word twice.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word twice.
Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to trigger the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it, three times. Each word seems to correspond to a specific color: ""lug"" to blue, ""dax"" to green, ""wif"" to red, and ""zup"" to yellow. When ""walm"" appears after any of these words, the output is the corresponding color repeated three times. If any word follows ""walm,"" the output changes to the color associated with that new word.

Therefore:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" triggers the repetition.
- ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red"" because ""dax"" corresponds to green (repeated three times due to ""walm"") followed by the new word ""wif,"" which corresponds to red.
- ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red"" as the repetition effect of ""walm"" is applied to ""wif,"" which is red.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug zup
    ",Output: green blue yellow,green blue yellow,True,142
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"". Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green
Explanation: Each example where the word 'dax' appears, the output is 'green.' Therefore, 'dax' consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that:

- Every instance of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red.""
- Other nonce words correspond to different colors each time they appear (zup -> yellow, bluf -> yellow, lug -> blue, dax -> green, walm -> red, etc.).

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" means ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word zup consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of the position in the sequence or the surrounding words.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to operate as a signifier for repeating the previous color mentioned, but changing it after one repeat:

- In the first example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red red"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" results in an extra ""red"" after repeating ""red"" once.

- In the second example, ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red"", where again ""bluf"" causes an additional ""red"" to follow after one instance of ""red"".

- In the third example, ""wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow"" – ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" results in one more ""yellow"" right after the initial ""yellow"".

- The fourth example, ""wif dax bluf"", follows the same pattern with ""red green green"" – ""bluf"" causes an additional ""green"".

- Lastly, in ""dax bluf wif zup wif"", we get ""green green red yellow red"". Here, ""bluf"" results in another ""green"" following the first, which complies with the established pattern.

Rule: bluf -> The rule is that ""bluf"" leads to the repetition of the color mentioned immediately before it once and then changes to the next color mentioned, if any.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at how the output changes with the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" in each input:

1. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

3. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue 

4. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green

5. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red

From these examples, we notice the following:

- Each occurrence of ""walm"" in the input adds multiple instances of a color in the output.
- The color that is repeated is always the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm.""
- The number of times the color is repeated seems to be three (three additional instances).

Given these observations, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another color-indicating word, it results in the output repeating that color three more times than it would appear without ""walm.""

So, in the given examples:

- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three more times than usual.
- In the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three more times.
- In the third example, ""lug"" appears just before ""walm"" once again, resulting in extra ""blue"" colors in the output.

Given this pattern, ""walm"" can be defined as a modifier that triples the occurrence of the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Therefore:
walm -> meaning: a modifier that triples the occurrence of the previously mentioned color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, each instance of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output. 

Rule: lug -> blue
Analyzing the input and output pairs, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Every instance of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the output. Moreover, ""dax"" does not appear to modify or be affected by adjacent words since it consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words around it.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.
Rule: zup -> yellow. 

Every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow"". Whether ""zup"" appears alone or within a sequence of other words, it consistently translates to ""yellow"". Thus, the rule indicates that ""zup"" means ""yellow"".
Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color signified by the word immediately preceding it. If ""bluf"" appears after ""lug,"" the output is ""blue."" If ""bluf"" appears after ""dax,"" the output is ""green."" If ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow."" If ""bluf"" is the first word or follows ""wif,"" it takes on the red color, similar to the ""wif"" output. Thus, ""bluf"" seems to act as a repeater for the color value of the word before it, with a default of red when it follows ""wif"" or has nothing to repeat.
To deduce the meaning of walm, let's examine the provided examples and the outputs. I'll analyze the patterns where ""walm"" appears and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   - Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug wif,"" and ""green"" is repeated twice before the pattern changes.
   
2. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   - ""Walm"" appears at the end, and ""red"" is repeated three times.
   
3. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   - ""Walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug wif,"" with ""yellow"" being repeated thrice before the pattern changes.
   
4. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   - Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and ""green"" is repeated four times, despite ""zup"" usually corresponding to ""yellow.""
   
5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   - ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times before the pattern shifts back to ""yellow"" for the final ""zup.""

In all instances, the appearance of ""walm"" seems to influence a sequence of the same colors to follow, with the number of repetitions possibly being related to the position of ""walm"" within the input (namely, the number of words after ""walm""). This suggests that ""walm"" could be a marker for repeating the next color in the sequence a number of times equal to the number of words that follow ""walm"" in the input.

However, there's an exception in example 4, where ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word that precedes it (""dax"" -> ""green""), rather than the next one.

Given this exception, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to repeat for a number of times equal to the number of words following ""walm"" in the input sequence.

So,

walm -> meaning. The color of the word before ""walm"" is repeated for the number of words that appear after ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it can be observed that the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to a particular color in the outputs. Specifically, every time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. For example, in the third input ""zup lug zup bluf lug,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output twice, while ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" as seen in the other examples. Similarly, in the fourth example, the input consists only of the word ""lug,"" and the output is simply ""blue."" 

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we are to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax."" Here's the breakdown of each input-output pair:

Input: lug wif dax | Output: blue red green
Input: lug dax     | Output: blue green
Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif | Output: red green red red yellow red
Input: lug dax lug wif          | Output: blue green blue red
Input: lug walm dax             | Output: blue blue blue green

From these examples, it seems that ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""bluf"" correspond to the colors ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. The word ""dax"" appears after a color word and seems to lead to the word ""green"" in the output. However, in the context where ""dax"" appears without a preceding known color word, such as after ""walm"" which has no established color association, green is still the output. 

The rule for ""dax"" then doesn't appear to depend on the preceding word to be converted to ""green"" because it still translates to ""green"" even when the preceding word isn’t associated with a specific output color, or when there is no preceding word at all.

From this analysis, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the outputs, irrespective of context. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: Each instance of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that each nonce word translates to a specific color when there is a one-to-one correspondence between the nonce word and a color output. 

The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the word ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Analyzing the examples provided, we can deduce that the nonce word ""bluf"" could be closely associated with the color ""blue."" Here is the reasoning:

- Every time the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
- There is a 1:1 correspondence between the occurrences of ""bluf"" in the input and ""blue"" in the output.
- ""Bluf"" is not affected by its position in the sequence or by the surrounding words, as it consistently translates to ""blue.""

Thus, based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> blue
walm -> repeat the color of the previous word

Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""walm"" is used, it means to repeat the color associated with the word directly preceding it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow,blue yellow,True,145
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, irrespective of its position in the input sequence.
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in every example provided.
Based on the provided examples, we can see that each occurrence of the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" Additionally, it appears that other nonce words correspond to different colors as they are repeated in different examples with the same color output. 

Here are the observed patterns:

- Every single occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red.""
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue.""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow.""
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green.""
- The word ""bluf"" also corresponds to the output ""green.""

It is important to note that the other nonce words preserve their output colors in different contexts, which suggests a one-to-one relationship between each nonce word and a color output in this rule system.

Rule: wif -> red

Meaning: The nonce word ""wif"" means ""red"" in the context of this problem.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' consistently translates to the color 'yellow' in every given example, irrespective of its position in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the output colors associated with each input sentence:

1. ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""
2. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
3. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
4. ""dax bluf zup"" -> ""green green yellow""
5. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue blue""

From the examples given:

- When ""zup"" appears, the output color is yellow. Example 1 and example 4 show ""zup"" leading to yellow output.
- When ""dax"" appears, the output color is green. Example 1 and example 3 show this.
- When ""wif"" appears, the output color is red. Example 2 demonstrates this.
- The word ""lug"" correlates with the output color blue, as seen in example 5.
  
In every instance, the color following ""bluf"" is the same as the one that precedes it, thereby indicating that ""bluf"" replicates the color output of the word before it. It works like a mirror for the previous word's color output.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be phrased as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeat the color output of the previous word in the sequence.
Observing the provided examples, I can see a clear pattern associated with the nonce word ""walm"" and the colors that follow it in the Output. In each case, ""walm"" seems to result in a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it in the Input.

Here is the breakdown of examples given:

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   
2. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   
3. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   
4. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   
5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

In each case, the color that appears after ""walm"" in the Output is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word that comes immediately before ""walm"" in the Input.

Rule:
walm -> the word ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color that corresponds to the previously mentioned word in the input sequence. The number of repetitions of the color is not specified by the word ""walm"" itself but can be inferred from the specific example.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of the context it appears in.
Rule: dax -> green. 

Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" directly corresponds to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. It's important to note that the context of the surrounding words does not seem to affect the output color for ""wif.""

The rule can be stated as: wif -> red.
From the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color in the output. Each instance of ""zup"" in the input is translated to ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, based on these examples, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Given the examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output. This can be seen because every time ""bluf"" is present in the input, ""red"" immediately follows it in the output, irrespective of the words around it.

Rule: bluf -> red.
walm -> repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it

Rule: When the nonce word ‘walm’ follows another word, the output is the color associated with the preceding word, repeated three times if the preceding word has one syllable (as in ""dax"" -> green, ""lug"" -> blue), and repeated four times if the word has two syllables (as in ""wif dax lug"" -> blue).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" correlates with the word ""green"" in the output. In each example, the presence of the word ""dax"" directly results in the word ""green"" in the corresponding position of the output.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the provided examples.
zup -> meaning. Meaning is ""yellow.""

Rule: zup always corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Given the examples provided, it is possible to deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" by examining the patterns of inputs and their corresponding outputs. Here is the analysis:

1. For input ""zup bluf wif lug dax,"" the output is ""yellow yellow red blue green,"" where ""bluf"" is associated with ""red"" since ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""yellow,"" ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""green,"" respectively.

2. In the second input ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" the output is ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the last ""red"" in the sequence, and all other words have a consistent color association with the first sequence, except ""walm,"" which produces two ""yellow.""

3. For ""wif bluf dax walm,"" the output is ""red red green green green."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red.""

4. In ""lug bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" also gives ""blue.""

5. For the final example ""zup dax bluf,"" the output is ""yellow green green."" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" must also correspond to ""green.""

By observing these patterns, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. Since we see ""bluf"" taking on different colors depending on context, it is likely that ""bluf"" is a repeating or duplicating rule rather than having a fixed color meaning.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word immediately before it.
Rule: ""walm"" -> repeat the color associated with the word just before ""walm"" in the sequence for the rest of the sequence.

Explanation of the rule:
- In the first example, ""dax"" comes before ""walm"" and the corresponding color for ""dax"" is green. Therefore, the rest of the sequence after ""walm"" is green.
  
- In the second example, ""lug"" is the word before ""walm"" and is associated with blue. So the output is blue repeated.
  
- In the third example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", and ""zup"" is associated with yellow. Consequently, the output is yellow repeated.
  
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" comes right before ""walm"". ""wif"" is associated with red in the output, and the color red is repeated for the rest of the sequence.
  
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is again the word before ""walm"", and thus the output sequence is red repeated after ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: irrespective of the context or position in the input, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position or context within the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the word ""yellow."" This conclusion is reached because every time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" directly corresponds to it in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following:

1. In every output, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color.
2. The color after the word ""bluf"" is a repetition of the color that ""bluf"" translates to (as seen in examples 1, 2, and 4).

Let's analyze the examples:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" and the output is ""yellow green."" Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" we can assume that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.”
- In example 2, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the output is ""yellow red."" Since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" we again see ""bluf"" corresponding to ""yellow.”
- In example 3, ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" ""Bluf"" comes after ""lug"" and before ""lug"" again. The output is ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.”
- In example 4, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" corresponds to the same color as the following word.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green,"" meaning ""bluf"" corresponds to the same color as the following word, which is ""green.""

Based on the pattern, we see that the color for ""bluf"" is not fixed but instead repeats the color of the following word, essentially a placeholder for the next color.

Rule: bluf represents a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that follows it. If ""bluf"" precedes a color word, it takes on that color for itself and repeats it.

Bluf -> The color mentioned after the term ""bluf"".
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it, for the following number of times equal to 1 plus the number of characters in ""walm"". Since ""walm"" has four characters, it will result in the preceding color being repeated five times. Here are the rules derived from each input:

1. In ""lug walm zup lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""walm"" following ""lug"" results in ""blue"" being repeated five times. But since another ""lug"" interrupts the sequence, the pattern resets and starts again after the second ""lug.""

2. In ""zup wif walm lug,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""walm"" following ""wif"" leads to ""red"" being repeated five times, after which ""lug"" changes the color to blue.

3. In ""wif lug dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""walm"" following ""dax"" causes ""green"" (the color associated with ""dax"") to be repeated five times.

4. In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" therefore ""walm"" following ""zup"" makes ""yellow"" repeat five times.

5. In ""lug walm dax,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""walm"" following ""lug"" makes ""blue"" repeat five times, after which ""dax"" changes it to green.

Rule: walm -> the rule is that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it to repeat one plus four times (since ""walm"" has four letters), resulting in that color being repeated five times.

    Rules:

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" Regardless of its position in the series of nonce words, the output corresponding to ""dax"" remains the same. Therefore, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Observing the provided examples and their corresponding outputs, the word ""wif"" seems to consistently result in the output ""red."" It does not seem to matter what other words are in the input; ""wif"" always translates to ""red."" The other words in the inputs output different colors; ""zup"" outputs ""yellow,"" ""walm"" outputs ""red,"" ""bluf"" outputs ""red,"" ""lug"" outputs ""blue,"" and ""dax"" outputs ""green.""

Given the information, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: wif -> red

Meaning ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" irrespective of its position or the context within the input sequence.
Rule: zup -> yellow

In every instance of the examples provided, the word ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow"" in the output. No matter the position of ""zup"" in the sequence, it consistently translates to the color yellow, suggesting that ""zup"" means yellow.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to a color output that is the same as the previous word. To elaborate:

- In ""wif bluf dax,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and then ""bluf"" also corresponds to red.
- In ""dax zup lug bluf,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and then ""bluf"" also corresponds to blue.
- In ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf,"" the word before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, so ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow.
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and then ""bluf"" also corresponds to red.
- In ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and then ""bluf"" also corresponds to yellow.

From these examples, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" -> takes the same color meaning as the immediately preceding word.
Walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: The word ""walm"" results in the word ""blue"" being repeated a number of times equal to the number of words that come before ""walm"" in the input sequence.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence of words.
Based on the provided examples, the following inferences can be made:

- Whenever `dax` is mentioned in the input, `green` appears in the corresponding output.
- Other words in the input correlate with different colors in the output (e.g., `wif` -> `red`, `zup` -> `yellow`, `lug` -> `blue`, `walm` -> `blue`).

Therefore, given this pattern, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"".
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" In every example, whenever ""bluf"" is mentioned, the output includes ""yellow"". The other words in the input correspond to different colors in the output, but ""bluf"" always remains consistent as ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> yellow

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

2. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

3. Input: wif dax lug walm

4. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue

5. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

From the examples above, we can observe the following:

- Every time ""walm"" appears, ""green"" is repeated three times in the output.
- The word ""walm"" itself does not correspond to a single color but seems to cause the following word's color to be outputted three times. For instance, in example 1, ""walm"" is followed by no word, and the output immediately repeats ""green"" three times. In examples 2 and 3, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" and ""lug,"" respectively, and in each case, the color corresponding to the following word is repeated thrice (red for ""wif"" and blue for ""lug"").
- The repetition pattern applies only to the word that immediately follows ""walm."" This is seen in examples 3, 4, and 5 where ""dax"" or ""lug"" follows ""walm,"" and the corresponding colors (green for ""dax,"" blue for ""lug"") are repeated.

Therefore, we can induce the rule that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the next word in the sequence to be repeated three times. If there is no word following ""walm,"" then ""green"" is repeated three times by default.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color of the following word to appear three times in the output. If ""walm"" is at the end of the list, output ""green"" three times.

Based on the provided examples, ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red."" There is one example where ""wif lug"" results in ""red blue,"" but without additional context or examples that include ""lug"" separately, we cannot definitely determine whether ""lug"" contributes to the output ""blue,"" or if it is combined with ""wif"" to create that output.

wif -> red

If additional patterns were recognized, they could provide insight into whether other words, when combined with ""wif,"" affect the output or if ""wif"" always singularly leads to the output ""red.""
Rule: zup -> yellow. 

The consistent rule across all examples is that whenever the nonce word ""zup"" is used, the output is ""yellow"".
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" directly translates to the word ""yellow"". Every single time the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

If ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the color is red. If there is no word provided before ""walm,"" it may defer to the last color rule applicable, or ""walm"" alone may not have an output, as evidenced by the lack of an example with ""walm"" standing alone. 

Therefore, ""walm"" signals a repetition of a color based on the preceding word, with the specific sequence: 
- ""dax walm"" causes a ""green green green"" output.
- ""wif walm"" causes a ""red red red"" output.
- In the absence of a clear preceding color indicator, ""walm"" seems to adopt the last color rule applied, as seen in the last example.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule:
- The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in every given example.
dax -> green

Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color green, regardless of its position within the input sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red regardless of its position in the input sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: When the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.

From the examples given, we can deduce the following:

Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow
Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red

Observations:

1. Whenever ""wif"" is paired with ""bluf"", the output is consistently ""red red"".
2. When ""zup"" is paired with ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow"".
3. Only in the instance where ""dax"" precedes ""zup bluf"", we get the output ""green yellow yellow"".

Conclusions:

1. The word ""bluf"" does not correspond to any single color output in these examples.
2. ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

Given these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" is a command or instruction to repeat the color that has been given to the previous word.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that 'walm' causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it. The rule seems to work as follows:

- In the first example, 'dax' corresponds to a single 'green', and after 'walm', we see 'green' repeated two more times for a total of three 'green'.
- In the second example, 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and after 'walm', we see 'red' repeated, making two 'red'.
- In the third example, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', and after 'walm', we see 'yellow' repeated five times.
- In the fourth example, 'dax' corresponds to 'green', and after 'walm', we see 'green' repeated for a total of three 'green'.
- In the fifth example, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', and after 'walm', we see 'blue' repeated for a total of three 'blue'.

With this in mind, the rule for 'walm' seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Causes the next sequence of colors in the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word a certain number of times. The specific number of repetitions appears to be based on the current sequence position or other input-related factors that are not entirely clear from the examples given.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" directly translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"". No matter the context within the sequences of words, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" Therefore, we can conclude the following:

Rule: dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we must look at the correspondences between the inputs and outputs. Let's examine the inputs and their respective outputs:

1. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red

2. Input: lug wif
   Output: blue red

3. Input: dax zup wif
   Output: green yellow red

4. Input: zup lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow blue yellow red green

5. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red

Here are the observations:

- Whenever the input ends with ""wif,"" the output ends with red.
- The word before ""wif"" does not correspond to red in other contexts (for example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""lug"" corresponds to blue). Therefore, it appears that ""wif"" directly corresponds to red irrespective of the preceding word.
  
Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif corresponds to the color red.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" appears to be a stand-in for the color ""yellow.""

So the rule is: zup -> yellow.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"", and to the color that corresponds with the preceding word when it is not preceded by ""wif"". 

So, for instance, when ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow yellow"" because the word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". However, when ""bluf"" directly follows ""wif"", regardless of what preceded ""wif"", the output is ""red red"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" results in repeating the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it, three times. Each other word in the input has a one-to-one correspondence with a color (lug -> blue, wif -> red, bluf -> blue, dax -> green, zup -> yellow). Therefore, when ""walm"" follows any of these words, the output is that word's corresponding color, repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
Observing the input-output relationships in the examples provided, it can be deduced that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of the position of ""zup"" within the input sequence or the surrounding context.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the provided examples, here is the deduced rule:

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" 

Whenever ""bluf"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output the same number of times as ""bluf"" appears. It does not seem to be affected by the position of ""bluf"" within the input or by the presence of other words.

Therefore:

bluf -> yellow.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" generates a series of repeated colors. To understand the rule, let's analyze the occurrences of ""walm"" and its consequent outputs in the examples:

1. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

2. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red

3. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow

4. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

From these examples, we observe:
- When ""walm"" immediately follows ""lug,"" the output is three ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" immediately follows ""wif,"" the output is three ""red.""
- When ""walm"" immediately follows ""zup,"" the output is three ""yellow.""
- ""Walm"" does not combine the preceding color word's output but instead initiates its own color sequence.
- The output color for ""walm"" seems to be determined by the word that immediately precedes it, either ""lug,"" ""wif,"" or ""zup,"" which produce ""blue,"" ""red,"" or ""yellow,"" respectively.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that the word ""walm"" causes the preceding color word's output to be repeated three times.

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the output color corresponding to the preceding color-indicating word (such as ""lug"" for blue, ""wif"" for red, ""zup"" for yellow) to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax wif lug walm zup
    ",Output: red green red blue blue blue yellow,red green red blue blue blue yellow,True,157
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's analyze the patterns:

- Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output, regardless of the position of ""lug"" within the sequence.
- ""Lug"" does not seem to be dependent on the surrounding words for its output, as it consistently translates to ""blue"" despite different context words such as ""walm"", ""zup"", ""bluf"", and ""dax"".
- No other input words consistently result in ""blue"" in the output, indicating that ""lug"" is the only input word that is directly associated with ""blue"".

Based on these observations, we can induce that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the provided input and output pairs, it appears that 'dax' is consistently translated to 'green'. In all instances where 'dax' appears in the input, the word 'green' appears in the output, with a one-to-one correspondence. The meaning of 'walm', 'lug', 'zup', and 'wif' can also be inferred to some degree based on their consistent translation to 'green', 'blue', 'yellow', and 'red' respectively.

Therefore, the rule inferred is:

dax -> green

This rule indicates that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs.
From the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"". The reason for this conclusion is that in every instance where ""wif"" appears, the output includes the word ""red"".

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" each time it appears. Here are the observations:

- In each instance where ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- The word ""zup"" seems to be a standalone unit and does not require context from adjacent words to determine its meaning.

Thus, we can induce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to cause the output word to repeat the color that would have been produced by the word preceding ""bluf"".

Here's the breakdown:

1. wif bluf dax -> red red green (wif is red, bluf repeats the red, dax is green)
2. wif dax bluf -> red green green (wif is red, dax is green, bluf repeats the green)
3. lug bluf -> blue blue (lug is blue, bluf repeats the blue)
4. zup bluf lug zup -> yellow yellow blue yellow (zup is yellow, bluf repeats yellow, lug is blue, zup is yellow again)
5. zup bluf -> yellow yellow (zup is yellow, bluf repeats yellow)

Rule: bluf causes the output to repeat the color of the previous input word. If there is no preceding word, it seems that bluf defaults to blue, as in example 3. However, if bluf has a preceding word, it takes on the color of that word.

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word or default to blue if there is no previous word.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color coded for the word that precedes it three times. Here's how the rule applies in each example:

1. In ""lug wif walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". The word ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red red red.""
2. In ""lug walm wif zup wif,"" ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" resulting in ""blue blue blue."" 
3. In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and following it, ""walm"" represents ""green green green.""
4. In ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and after it, ""walm"" represents ""yellow yellow yellow.""
5. In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""wif"" is coded as ""red,"" and following it, ""walm"" translates to ""red red red.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax zup wif
    ",Output: blue green yellow red,blue green yellow red,True,158
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Observing the given examples, we can try to figure out the rules for the nonce word ""lug"" by looking at the common pattern in the color outputs:

1. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
2. zup lug -> yellow blue
3. dax walm lug -> green green green blue
4. lug bluf -> blue blue
5. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green

Now, let's analyze the instances where ""lug"" appears:

- In the first example, after ""lug"" is mentioned, the color sequence changes from mostly red to blue and then yellow, which doesn't appear in the sequence before ""lug.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" directly translates to blue, as there are only two terms and two colors.
- In the third example, ""lug"" changes the sequence from all green to blue.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, followed by another blue for ""bluf.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" precedes a series of colors that differ from each other, starting with blue.

Considering these observations, it's apparent that ""lug"" has an effect of changing the pattern of colors. It appears to reset or change the sequence of the color pattern. The most consistent rule we can deduce from these examples is that ""lug"" translates to the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue
Considering the provided examples, we can deduce the following pattern:

- Each time the word ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- The word ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue.""
- The word ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow.""
- The word ""wif"" maps to ""red"" in the given context.
- The word ""walm"" does not have a direct mapping visible, but considering it appears twice before ""dax"" and both are translated as ""blue,"" it seems it could also mean ""blue"" or simply repeats the color of the preceding word (if the preceding word is also a color).

Based on these observations:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" directly translates to the color red in the output. Every occurrence of ""wif"" in the input results in ""red"" in the output, irrespective of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can associate each input word with a corresponding color in the output. The word ""wif"" consistently results in ""red,"" and the word ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue,"" regardless of position. When ""zup"" appears in the input, the color ""yellow"" is included in the output.

For each input example where ""zup"" appears:

- ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow"" (It's notable that ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow"" at the end, but other words are contributing to the sequence of colors here.)
- ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red"" (""zup"" appears first and maps to ""yellow,"" followed by ""wif"" which maps to ""red."")
- ""wif lug zup"" -> ""red blue yellow"" (""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."")
- ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow"" (When ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" the result is ""red yellow,"" indicating the sequence follows the order of the words.)
- ""lug zup"" -> ""blue yellow"" (""lug"" is first and maps to ""blue,"" followed by ""zup"" which maps to ""yellow."")

No other information about possible meanings of ""zup"" outside of these examples has been provided, so based on the given data:

Rule: zup -> yellow
From the provided input and output examples, we can deduce a pattern that corresponds to the color associated with each word or sequence of words. Let's analyze the pattern:

1. **zup** always corresponds to ""yellow"":
   - zup wif bluf zup -> yellow red red yellow
   - zup bluf wif lug dax -> yellow yellow red blue green
   - zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
   - dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
   - zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green

2. **wif** always corresponds to ""red"":
   - zup wif bluf zup -> yellow red red yellow
   - zup bluf wif lug dax -> yellow yellow red blue green
   - zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
   - dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow

3. **dax** always corresponds to ""green"":
   - zup bluf wif lug dax -> yellow yellow red blue green
   - dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
   - zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green

4. **lug** is seen once and corresponds to ""blue"":
   - zup bluf wif lug dax -> yellow yellow red blue green
   
From the above analysis, it's clear that each word corresponds to one color. However, ""bluf"" does not have a consistent color associated with it; instead, it takes the *color of the word that precedes it* (or repeats it, in case it is at the beginning of a sequence):

- In ""zup bluf wif lug dax"", ""bluf"" takes the color of ""zup"", which is yellow -> yellow yellow red blue green.
- In ""dax bluf wif zup"", ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax"", which is green -> green green red yellow.
- When ""bluf"" is at the start of a sequence and followed by ""zup"", it replicates the color associated with ""zup"", which is yellow -> yellow yellow green.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it will output the color that corresponds to the word that is immediately before it, or, if it's at the beginning of the sequence, the word that follows it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word; if at the start, then takes the color of the following word.
walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a sequence of the previous color repeated three times.

Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to produce an output that is a triplet of the color word that immediately precedes it. Here are the deductions based on the examples given:

- Example 1: ""wif walm"" produced ""red red red"", where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- Example 2: ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm"" included the sequence ""red red red"" after ""wif walm"", where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- Example 3: ""lug wif walm"" produced ""blue red red red"", where ""wif"" immediately precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""red"".
- Example 4: ""dax lug walm"" produced ""green blue blue blue"", where ""lug"" immediately precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""blue"".
- Example 5: ""zup wif dax walm lug"" produced ""yellow red green green green"", where ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""green"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug means blue. Whenever the input includes ""lug,"" the output includes ""blue.""
From the examples provided, it can be deduced that dax has a consistent output across all examples. Whenever dax appears in the input, the output always includes green. This consistent mapping, regardless of the position of dax in the input or the surrounding words, suggests that dax is directly translated to green. 

Therefore, the rule for dax is: 

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to a particular color, as all other nonces correlate with colors as well. Specifically, ""wif"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""red."" This is evident from each example where the word ""wif"" is followed by one or multiple instances of the output ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to repeat the color that corresponds to the word directly preceding it. Each unique word before ""bluf"" (lug, zup, wif, dax) is paired with a distinct color (blue, yellow, red, green respectively). When ""bluf"" is used after any of these words, the output repeats the color associated with that word. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word preceding it.
The rule appears to be that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the most recent color output before ""walm"" is mentioned.

Let's verify this by looking at the provided examples:

1. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   Here, ""wif"" corresponds to red. ""walm"" immediately follows, and the corresponding output is another red, so ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif"". ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

2. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Again, ""walm"" is repeated after ""wif"", which is red, so ""walm"" repeats red. Later, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"", which is yellow, and it repeats the color yellow.

3. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   Here, ""zup"" is yellow, and the ""walm"" that follows echoes the preceding color, yellow.

4. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   ""Lug"" corresponds to blue, and the ""walm"" after it echoes that blue color.

5. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   ""Lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" repeats the color blue.

From these examples, we can establish the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color output that immediately precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the output ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, it appears that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. The word 'dax' consistently translates to 'green' in each example, no matter its position in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green. 

Rule: The word 'dax' corresponds to the color green.
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in every example provided.
Based on the examples given:

- Every instance of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- Every instance of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- Every instance of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- Every instance of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

Since ""bluf"" corresponds to the same color as the word immediately preceding it, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> meaning: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that comes directly before it. If the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif"", the output is ""red"". If the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax"", the output is ""green"".
walm -> meaning. Rule: The word ""walm"" results in three reds in the output. It appears that for every occurrence of the word ""walm,"" it is translated to three instances of ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""lug"" translates directly to the color ""blue."" Each instance of ""lug"" in the inputs corresponds to ""blue"" in the outputs, and it does not appear to be context-dependent. The other words correspond to their own colors and are consistent across the examples.

Rule:
lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it seems that every time the word ""dax"" appears, the output is green regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context in which it is used. Therefore, it can be deduced that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of the context in which it is used.
Based on the provided examples, we can try to determine a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word 'zup'.

From the first example:
Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
Here, 'zup' seems to correspond to 'yellow'.

From the second example:
Input: dax zup
Output: green yellow
Here, 'dax' appears to correspond to 'green' and 'zup' again corresponds to 'yellow'.

From the third example:
Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
In this case, 'dax' correlates with 'green'. 'walm' repeats the color of the previous word, and 'lug' seems to switch to a new color, 'blue'. 'zup' again corresponds to 'yellow'.

From the fourth example:
Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
The pattern seems to hold: 'zup' again corresponds to 'yellow', 'walm' repeats the previous color, and 'lug' switches to a new color.

From the final example:
Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
Output: green green red yellow blue
Once more, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'.

Rule:
zup -> yellow

The rule seems to be that 'zup' consistently means 'yellow' based on these examples.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Support for this claim based on the given examples:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red,"" indicating that ""wif"" means ""red"" and ""bluf"" repeats it.
- ""dax bluf zup"" translates to ""green green yellow,"" suggesting that ""dax"" means ""green,"" ""bluf"" repeats ""green,"" and ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
- In ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" the output is ""blue blue red blue red red red blue,"" demonstrating that ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" again repeats the color of the word before it, which is ""blue"" in this case.

Therefore:
bluf -> meaning. Meaning: ""bluf"" refers to repeating the color associated with the preceding word.
Rule: Based on the given examples, every instance of the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to an output of three ""red"" colors in a row. Thus, it seems that ""walm"" indicates the sequence of three reds.

walm -> meaning: a sequence of three ""red"" colors.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each word translates to a specific color:

- wif -> red
- bluf -> green (note: in the first example, 'bluf' follows 'dax' and is also translated as green, but this is likely due to the fact that 'dax' itself is translated to green)
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Each word consistently translates to the same color in all the examples. Following this pattern, 'dax' consistently translates to green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" each time it occurs, regardless of its position within the input sequence.
Rule: bluf -> red

Each occurrence of the word ""bluf"" is translated into the color ""red"" in the given examples.
Given the examples provided, let's examine the outputs corresponding to each instance where the nonce word ""walm"" appears.

Example 1:
- Input: dax walm
- Output: green green green

Example 2:
- Input: lug wif dax zup walm
- Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

Example 3:
- Input: dax walm wif
- Output: green green green red

Example 4:
- Input: dax lug wif walm
- Output: green blue red red red

Example 5:
- Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
- Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

From these examples, each time the word ""walm"" appears in the input, the corresponding output repeats the color associated with the word that directly precedes ""walm"" three times. 

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and following ""walm"" we have ""green green green.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and following ""walm"" we have ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and following ""walm"" we have ""green green green.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and following ""walm"" we have ""red red red.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and following ""walm"" we have ""yellow yellow yellow.""

From above findings, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,163
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, lug seems to be a rule for outputting the color blue. Every time the word lug appears in the input, the word blue appears in the output. Additionally, we can see that other words might translate to other colors; for instance, 'wif' appears to correspond to 'red' and 'bluf' likely corresponds to 'blue' as well (or it could be used to reinforce the blue output when it follows 'lug'). 'Dax' seems to correspond to 'green'. 

Thus, the rule can be deduced as follows:

lug -> blue

To expand on the other words based on the provided examples (though not requested, it can help in understanding the context):
- wif -> red
- bluf -> blue
- dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: wif -> red. 

The rule seems to be that whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is the color ""red"".
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs. We will make note of the consistent presence of ""zup"" and what colors it produces in the output across different examples.

- In each instance where ""zup"" appears, ""yellow"" invariably appears in the output.
- ""zup"" seems to be independent of position within the input string, as its position varies but always results in ""yellow"" in the output.
- The number of occurrences of ""zup"" in the input does not alter the number of times ""yellow"" appears in the output (it is always one yellow per ""zup"" occurrence).

From these observations, we can deduce the rule:
Rule: zup -> yellow
From analyzing the examples provided, we can deduce the following pattern between the input and output:

- In example 1, input ""bluf"" corresponds to output ""blue"".
- In example 2, input ""bluf"" corresponds to output ""yellow blue"" when it appears after ""lug"", but those colors correspond to ""lug"" and ""zup"", which indicates that the output ""blue"" for ""bluf"" is consistent, whereas ""yellow"" corresponds to ""lug"".
- In example 3, input ""bluf"" corresponds to output ""red blue"" when it appears after ""wif"", but given the consistent correspondence of ""blue"" to ""bluf"" in previous examples, we can assume ""red"" corresponds to ""wif"".
- In example 4, input ""bluf"" corresponds to output ""red red green"", but since the output ""red"" can be correlated with ""wif"" from a previous example, and ""green"" seems to correlate with ""dax"", we can reinforce the guess that ""bluf"" consistently correlates to ""blue"".
- In example 5, input ""bluf"" corresponds to output ""red red green"", with ""bluf"" specifically corresponding to the second ""red"" (as ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red""), indicating once more that the term on its own translates to ""blue"".

From these patterns, it appears that regardless of where ""bluf"" occurs in the sequence, the output color is always ""blue"". Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> blue
Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word as many times as the number of letters in the word ""walm"" (which is three times). 

So ""walm"" following any color word leads to that color repeated three times. For example, after ""dax"" (which translates to ""green""), ""walm"" results in ""green green green"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax lug walm zup
    ",Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow,yellow green blue blue blue yellow,True,164
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word 'dax' consistently translates to the color 'green' in every given example.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red in every given example.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup"", let's analyze the patterns:

- Wherever ""lug"" appears, ""blue"" follows.
- ""wif"" corresponds to always being followed by ""red"".
- ""walm"" is always followed by ""red"".
- ""dax"" is always followed by ""green"".
- ""bluf"" is always followed by ""yellow"".
- ""zup"" seems to be followed by ""yellow"", but it does not always precede it directly. 

Now let's check the pattern considering every time ""zup"" appears:

1. ""lug zup"" -> ""blue yellow"" (zup follows lug)
2. ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue"" (zup precedes wif, which is followed by red)
3. ""zup bluf lug zup"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow"" (zup precedes bluf and follows lug, where bluf is followed by yellow and lug by blue)
4. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> ""yellow red green green green blue"" (zup precedes wif, which is followed by red; dax by green; walm also by red but is followed by multiple reds, and lug by blue)
5. ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow"" (zup follows dax which is followed by green, and bluf is followed by yellow)

From these observations, we can deduce a pattern where ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"". The ""yellow"" representation often (but not strictly) follows after ""zup"" except when preceded by ""lug"" or another ""zup"". Therefore, it doesn't affect the colors after it but adds ""yellow"" to the sequence.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
bluf -> repeats the color word that immediately precedes it in the input.

Rule: If the word before 'bluf' is associated with a color in the output, then 'bluf' takes on the meaning of that color word and repeats it in the output. Example, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue,' so when 'bluf' follows 'lug,' the output is 'blue blue.' Similarly, 'wif' corresponds to 'red,' 'dax' to 'green,' and 'zup' to 'yellow'; therefore, 'bluf' repeats the color of the word that comes before it in the output sequence.
Rule: walm -> blue

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red"". Therefore, the rule appears to be that the word ""wif"" translates directly to the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples given, zup appears to correspond to the color yellow each time it is used, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. There is a one-to-one mapping between the word ""zup"" and the color ""yellow"" in all examples provided.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each unique word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can look at the consistent pattern in the outputs where it appears.

Here are the associations we can deduce:

- ""wif"" is consistently associated with the color ""red.""
- ""lug"" is consistently associated with the color ""blue.""
- ""zup"" is consistently associated with the color ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" is associated with ""red"" in the first example, with ""yellow"" in the second, and this pattern continues across the other examples where ""bluf"" appears always associated with the color ""red.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to be associated with the color blue and repetition of that color. Here’s the evidence supporting this:

1. The first example associates ""dax"" with a single ""green,"" ""wif"" with a single ""red,"" and ""zup"" with a single ""yellow."" However, ""walm"" is followed by three ""green"" suggesting that ""walm"" causes the color before it to repeat three times.

2. In the second example, ""lug"" is followed by three ""blue,"" which implies that ""lug"" on its own translates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes the repetition.

3. The third example solidifies that ""walm"" is causing the repetition because ""lug"" is ""blue” and ""wif"" is ""red,"" but when ""walm"" follows them, it causes that color to repeat three times.

4. The fourth and fifth examples support the same rule because ""walm"" consistently causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat three times.

Based on the consistent pattern across all examples, we conclude that:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to repeat three times.

Therefore: walm -> causes the preceding color to repeat three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,166
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a color as follows:

dax -> green
lug -> blue
wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Whenever 'zup' appears, the output is 'yellow', whether 'zup' is alone or in sequence with other words.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine its corresponding output in each example.

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is translated to ""red"" when it is preceded by ""wif dax wif"" and followed by ""zup.""
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when preceded by ""wif dax wif.""
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red"" when it is preceded by ""wif.""
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" when it is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""zup.""
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" when it is immediately preceded by ""dax.""

From these examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" takes its meaning from the word immediately preceding it, based on the following observations:

- When preceded by ""wif,"" ""bluf"" becomes ""red.""
- When preceded by ""lug,"" ""bluf"" becomes ""blue.""
- When preceded by ""dax,"" ""bluf"" becomes ""green.""
- The word following ""bluf"" doesn't seem to influence its meaning.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the word immediately preceding it: ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" leads to ""green.""

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color corresponding to the word just before it - ""wif"" gives ""red,"" ""lug"" gives ""blue,"" and ""dax"" gives ""green.""
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a triplication of the color that precedes it.

Here are the observations:

1. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" translates to ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue."" The word ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and there are triple ""yellow"" colors following it.

2. ""lug walm zup walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" corresponding to ""blue"" and results in triple ""blue"" colors and then ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"" and results in triple ""yellow"" colors.

3. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow"" and results in triple ""yellow"" colors.

4. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" where ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green"" and results in triple ""green"" colors.

From the above examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color word that comes immediately before it to repeat three times. If we convert this observation into a rule for the meaning of ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" In each instance where ""lug"" is present in the input, the word ""blue"" is in the corresponding position in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it can be deduced that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Therefore, each instance of ""zup"" in the input results in ""yellow"" in the output. The presence of additional words after ""zup"" seems to correspond with other colors as well.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> green if it follows dax, otherwise yellow.
walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, the color associated with the previous word is repeated three times in the output. If ""walm"" is preceded by multiple words, the colors associated with each of those words are output once followed by the last color being repeated three times. For example:
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" because ""dax"" is associated with green.
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" is associated with yellow.
- ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow"" because ""wif"" is associated with red, ""dax"" with green, and ""zup"" with yellow. ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" so red is repeated three times, followed by the colors corresponding to ""dax"" and ""zup.""
- ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue"" because ""dax"" is associated with green, ""lug"" with blue, and ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word right before it, which is ""lug"" (blue), three times.
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" is associated with blue and ""walm"" repeats that color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each given example, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" Thus, we induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the rule that can be deduced for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" is:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the word ""zup"":

From the first example, ""zup dax walm"" translates to ""yellow green green green,"" and ""zup dax bluf"" translates to ""yellow green green."" This suggests that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" regardless of the following words.

The third example, ""zup,"" translates to ""yellow"" without any additional context, which reinforces the idea that ""zup"" consistently means ""yellow.""

In the fourth example, ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" each time it appears. ""lug"" appears to correspond to ""blue,"" occurring twice in both the input and the output.

The fifth example, ""zup lug,"" translates to ""yellow blue,"" further supporting the meaning deduced from the previous examples where ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" follows the rule of translating to ""blue.""

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"" 

This rule remains consistent across all examples provided, indicating that the word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
Rule: When bluf appears in the sequence, it replicates the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Examples supporting the rule:

- In ""wif bluf"", bluf takes on the color of ""wif"", which is red. Thus, bluf -> red.
- In ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"", bluf follows ""zup"", which is yellow. Thus, bluf -> yellow.
- In ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"", bluf follows ""dax"", which is green. Thus, bluf -> green.
- In ""zup bluf"", bluf follows ""zup"", which is yellow. Thus, bluf -> yellow.
- In ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"", there are two instances of bluf. The first follows ""zup"" (yellow), the second follows ""lug"" (blue). Thus, bluf -> yellow and then bluf -> blue respectively.

Therefore, bluf -> the color of the word that comes immediately before it.
Analyzing the given examples and their corresponding outputs, an attempt to deduce the pattern or rule for the nonce word ""walm"" will be made.

Let's take a closer look at each instance of ""walm.""

1. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
2. wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
3. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
4. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
5. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow

In each case, ""walm"" seems to result in a sequence of ""yellow"" repeated three times in the output.

Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color output of the next word three times. For clarification:

- In the first example, ""lug"" comes after ""walm"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" After ""walm,"" we get ""blue"" three times.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is the last word. Looking at the output, after ""walm"" there are three ""yellow"" which correspond to the previous word ""zup.""
- In the third and fourth examples, ""walm"" again leads to three repetitions of the word ""yellow,"" following the same pattern.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" is the word after ""walm,"" and in the output ""green"" is repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:
walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the next word three times.

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color of the word immediately following it to appear three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue"" across all examples.
Based on the examples provided, we need to infer the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" in the context of sequences of words transformed into sequences of colors.

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears, it translates to the color ""green.""
2. Other words seem to be consistently translating to specific colors as well, like ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""walm"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
3. The word ""bluf"" does not have an Input: example to directly relate it to a color, but in the Output: it corresponds to ""yellow,"" like ""zup."" However, because it is repeated, it could follow a rule that repetition indicates maintaining the same color. 

Based on these observations, the rule we can induce is:
Rule: ""dax"" -> ""green""

This is consistent across all examples, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the surrounding words.
Based on the provided examples, it looks like each nonce word corresponds to a color:

- wif corresponds to the color red.
- dax corresponds to the color green.
- zup corresponds to the color yellow.
- bluf corresponds to the color red.
- lug corresponds to the color blue.

No matter the position of ""wif"" in the sequence, the output is always red. Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" correlates to the color red, independent of the context.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to take on the color value of the word immediately preceding it. To confirm this rule, look at the color outputs in each example:

1. In the first example, 'bluf' follows 'wif' and the output is 'red red', showing that 'bluf' has taken on the color 'red' which matches 'wif'.
2. In the second example, 'bluf' follows 'lug' and the output is 'blue blue', confirming that 'bluf' takes the color of 'lug' (blue).
3. In the third example, 'bluf' follows 'zup' and the output is 'yellow yellow', adhering to the pattern where 'bluf' assimilates the color value of 'zup'.
4. In the fourth example, 'bluf' also follows 'wif' and similarly outputs 'red red'.
5. In the last example, 'bluf' follows 'dax' and the output is 'green green', which also supports the rule that 'bluf' takes on the color of the preceding word.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color value of the word immediately preceding it.
Rule: walm -> an increase in the amount of the last color mentioned before it.

Explanation: Each time ""walm"" appears in the input, the output repeats the last mentioned color an increased number of times.

- In the first input example, the last color mentioned before ""walm"" is blue (""lug""), and the output following ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue,"" showing an increase in the quantity of blue.

- In the second input example, the last color mentioned before ""walm"" is yellow (""zup""), and the output following ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating an increase in the quantity of yellow.

- In the third input example, the last color mentioned before ""walm"" is green (""dax""), and the output following ""walm"" is ""green green green,"" showing an increase in the number of greens.

- In the fourth input example, the last color mentioned before ""walm"" is red (""wif""), and the output following ""walm"" is ""red red red,"" demonstrating an increase in the quantity of red.

- In the fifth input example, the last color mentioned before ""walm"" is red (""wif""), and the output following ""walm"" is ""red red red,"" again showing an increase in the number of reds.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
From the provided examples, it seems that the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" is context-dependent, relating specifically to the colors that follow it in the outputs. Here's what we can deduce from the examples:

1. When ""dax"" precedes ""zup bluf,"" the output is ""green yellow yellow."" We observe that ""green"" is associated with ""dax,"" and ""yellow"" appears for both ""zup"" and ""bluf.""

2. When ""dax"" comes before ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green,"" which suggests that ""green"" is associated with ""dax"" and ""walm"" individually, as well as combined.

3. When ""dax"" precedes ""wif,"" the output is ""green red."" Here, ""green"" is linked to ""dax,"" and ""red"" is linked to ""wif.""

4. When ""dax"" is at the end of the input string as in ""wif zup walm dax zup,"" the output follows the previous patterns for ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""walm,"" until we reach ""dax,"" which results in ""green.""

5. The last example, ""dax walm wif bluf,"" follows the established pattern. ""Dax"" is followed by ""green,"" ""walm"" by ""green,"" and then ""wif"" by ""red."" ""Bluf,"" which follows ""wif,"" results in an additional ""red,"" indicating a context-dependent reaction when ""wif"" precedes ""bluf.""

Given these observations, it appears that ""dax"" specifically correlates to the output ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence; therefore, the other words (like ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and ""bluf"") yield their respective colors that may depend on their position and the context created by adjacent words.

Rule: dax -> green. The meaning of ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
Based on the examples given, zup translates to yellow consistently regardless of where it appears in the sequence. Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
Based on the inputs and corresponding outputs provided, each word on the input side corresponds to one or more colors on the output side. The outputs seem to be consistent whenever the same input word is used. The nonce word ""bluf"" appears in each input, and its corresponding output is always a repetition of the color that came before it. 

For example, the second word in each input string corresponds with ""yellow,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""zup""(which outputs yellow), the next word in the output is ""yellow."" Similarly, when the word before ""bluf"" is ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" the output of ""bluf"" is ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be: repeat the color of the previous word.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the previous word.
Based on the provided examples, the meaning of ""walm"" seems to be tied to the repetition of the last color mentioned before it. Here is the rule:

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the last mentioned color until a new color word is introduced.

Here are the breakdowns for each example to illustrate the rule:

1. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   Explanation: Before ""walm"" is ""dax"", which corresponds to green, so ""walm"" repeats green.

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Explanation: Before ""walm"" is ""lug"", which corresponds to blue, so ""walm"" repeats blue.

3. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   Explanation: Before ""walm"" is ""zup"", which corresponds to yellow, so ""walm"" repeats yellow.

4. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   Explanation: Before ""walm"" is ""wif"", which corresponds to red, so ""walm"" repeats red.

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Explanation: Before ""walm"" is ""wif"", which corresponds to red, so ""walm"" repeats red.

Therefore:
walm -> Repeat the last mentioned color until a new color word is introduced.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word 'lug' appears in the input, the corresponding output is 'blue'.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds with the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of the other words present or their positions. The other words in the inputs correspond to different colors in the outputs. For example, ""zup"" seems to correspond with ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds with ""green.""

Here is the observed pattern:

- Every time ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" appears in the output.
- The appearance of ""dax"" does not require context from other words to be associated with ""green.""

Thus, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that each nonce word translates to a specific color. To determine the meaning of the word ""wif,"" we can look at how it's used in different contexts:

- In the first example, ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red,"" indicating that:
  - ""lug"" could mean ""blue,"" and it appears once before and once after ""wif,"" probably affecting the number of times ""red"" is repeated.
  - ""walm"" also seems to trigger a repetition of ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif dax zup dax"" translates to ""red green yellow green,"" which shows:
  - ""wif"" again translates to ""red.""
  - ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and doesn't appear to affect the number of times ""red"" is repeated since ""wif"" stands alone as ""red.""
  - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue,"" which further suggests:
  - ""lug"" by itself means ""blue,"" but when it appears in pairs around ""wif,"" it may cause a doubling effect of the colors that follow.
  - ""walm"" isn't followed by ""red"" here, possibly because the effect of ""lug"" takes precedence, doubling the ""blue"" instead.
  - ""bluf"" likely means ""blue,"" and the repetition is due to the preceding ""lug.""
- The fifth example reinforces the previous findings, with ""lug wif walm"" translating to ""blue red red red"" again, consistently with the second example.

Thus, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to ""red."" The number of times ""red"" is repeated may be affected by the presence of the words ""lug"" and ""walm,"" which seem to cause repetition in the colors that follow them. However, the basic meaning of ""wif"" on its own is simply ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" in the input translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
bluf -> the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes the color that is associated with the immediately preceding word in the input. If ""zup"" is associated with yellow, ""lug"" with blue, ""dax"" with green, and ""wif"" with red, then ""bluf"" following any of those words would take their color. For instance, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"", while ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"".
In the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to affect not only the word immediately preceding or succeeding it but extends its influence to multiple words, resulting in a repetition of the color for a determined amount of times. 

For instance, in the first example:

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

The sequence ""wif walm lug"" results in ""red red red blue,"" where ""walm"" leads to the repetition of ""red"" three times before proceeding to the next color ""blue"" associated with ""lug.""

Similarly, in the second example:

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow

""wif walm lug"" produces ""red red red blue."" Here again, ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times.

Furthermore, in the third and fourth examples:

Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

""walm"" causes the preceding color word, ""zup"" in the third example and ""lug"" in the fourth example, to be repeated three times before changing to the next color associated with the following word.

Finally, in the fifth example:

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

""walm"" alone after ""dax"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color word that precedes it to be repeated three times before the sequence continues.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

Based on the examples provided, whenever the nonce word ""zup"" is used in an input, the output always includes ""yellow."" Therefore, ""zup"" means ""yellow.""

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the given examples. Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" is included in the output at the same position.
Based on the provided examples, we can discern a pattern correlating the input words to the output colors. The word 'dax' in each example consistently corresponds to the output 'green.'

Here are the mappings visible from the inputs and outputs:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- bluf -> green
- zup -> yellow

In each instance, regardless of the surrounding words, 'dax' maps directly to 'green.' Therefore, we can deduce that the rule for 'dax' is as follows:

dax -> green. Rule: The word 'dax' corresponds to the color green in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red."" This can be seen when ""wif"" appears alone and when it is in combination with other words. Therefore, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the other words present.
Rule: Based on the examples provided where ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red"" and the consistent appearance of ""red"" each time ""bluf"" appears, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red."" 

Thus, the rule is:
bluf -> red
Observing the outputs that correspond to the inputs containing the nonce word ""walm,"" we can attempt to establish a rule for what ""walm"" signifies. Here are the mappings for the colors based on the provided examples:

- ""lug"" seems to map to a single ""blue.""
- ""dax"" seems to map to a single ""green.""
- ""zup"" seems to map to a single ""yellow.""

When ""walm"" is introduced, the output colors increase. Specifically, we see the following:

- In the presence of ""lug walm,"" the output is three ""blue.""
- In the presence of ""dax zup dax walm,"" the output is five ""green.""
- In the presence of ""zup dax walm,"" the output is three ""green.""
- In the presence of ""lug walm zup lug walm,"" the output is three ""blue,"" followed by a single ""yellow,"" and then by three ""blue"" again.
- In the presence of ""dax walm lug,"" the output is three ""green"" followed by a single ""blue.""

It appears that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it three times. Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word (nonce word), it outputs that color word's corresponding color three times. 

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" based on the given context is:
walm -> Repeat the preceding color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each provided example.
From the provided examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color 'green' in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. The rule seems to be quite straightforward in this case.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each time the nonce word ""wif"" is used in the input, it corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output. There does not seem to be any additional dependency on context for the meaning of the word ""wif"". Therefore, the rule can be written as:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples where the nonce word ""zup"" is used, it appears consistently associated with the color ""yellow"" in the output. Regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" mirrors the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here's how the rule applies to each given example:

- In the first example (""dax zup bluf""), ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" following ""zup"" results in ""yellow.""
- In the second example (""zup lug zup bluf lug""), ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and is associated with ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" results in another ""yellow.""
- In the third example (""lug bluf zup lug""), ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and is associated with ""blue,"" thus ""bluf"" also results in ""blue.""
- In the fourth example (""wif bluf dax""), ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and is associated with ""red,"" leading to ""bluf"" also being ""red.""
- In the fifth example (""dax bluf""), ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and following this pattern, ""bluf"" also results in ""green.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is as follows:

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.
walm -> meaning. Rule: The word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times. For example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"", ""dax walm"" to ""green green green"", and when ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"", which corresponds to blue, it results in ""blue blue blue"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of the context in which it is used.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

- Whenever the input is ""dax"" alone, the output is consistently ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is combined with other words like ""wif"" and ""zup,"" the output for ""dax"" remains ""green"" while the other words produce different colors (wif -> red, zup -> yellow).

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" can be understood as:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following mappings for each word:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> red
- dax -> green

Thus, the word ""wif"" consistently maps to the color ""red"" in each example regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position or the context within a sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the correlation between its position in the input and the colors in the output:

Input: `zup dax zup dax wif bluf`  
Output: `yellow green yellow green red red`  

Input: `dax wif bluf`  
Output: `green red red`  

Input: `lug bluf wif`  
Output: `blue blue red`  

Input: `zup bluf lug zup`  
Output: `yellow yellow blue yellow`  

Input: `zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug`  
Output: `yellow green green red yellow yellow blue`  

Analyzing the sequences:
- Wherever ""bluf"" appears, the following color in the output is the same as the previous color. 
- 'bluf' doesn't seem to generate a new color but repeats the previously mentioned color.

Based on this information:

Rule: Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, it results in the color immediately before it being repeated in the output.

Therefore:

bluf -> Repeat the previous color mentioned in the output.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be associated with repeating the color attributed to the word that precedes it. Let's analyze the examples:

1. wif dax lug walm
- Output: red green blue blue blue
- ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" After ""walm"" is introduced, ""blue"" is repeated.

2. lug walm zup lug walm
- Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
- ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm"" there are repeated ""blue"" colors. The same pattern is observed later in the sequence after ""lug"" and ""walm.""

3. dax walm
- Output: green green green
- ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and the color ""green"" is repeated.

4. dax walm
- Output: green green green
- The same pattern as in the previous example where ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"": ""green"" is repeated.

5. dax walm zup lug dax
- Output: green green green yellow blue green
- ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and ""green"" is repeated after ""walm."" The sequence then continues without repetition after new words are introduced.

Rule:
walm -> Causes the color of the word that precedes it to repeat.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,176
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples, here's the analysis for each instance of ""dax"" and its corresponding color:

- ""dax"" when it follows ""walm"" or ""wif"" or is the first word in the sequence results in ""green.""
- ""dax"" when following itself or another ""dax"" results in ""green"" as well, maintaining the pattern.
- ""dax"" has no instances where it immediately precedes another word while not being the first word, except when it immediately follows another ""dax,"" so we do not have any examples of ""dax"" being anything other than ""green.""

However, there's a direct correlation in every instance with ""dax"" being ""green"" despite the surrounding words. This may indicate that ""dax"" is independent of its surrounding context or that there's not enough variety in the examples given to conclusively prove context dependence. It's worth noting there are no cases provided where ""dax"" produces a different result.

Given this information, the deduced rule is as follows:

Rule: ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green,"" with no variation regardless of its position or surrounding words.

Thus, dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to relate to the output color that it corresponds to. The term ""bluf"" is translated to the color ""yellow"" whenever it follows the nonce word ""zup"" and to ""blue"" in all the other contexts. Here is the deduced rule:

bluf -> meaning:
- When preceded by ""zup,"" bluf means ""yellow.""
- When not preceded by ""zup,"" bluf means ""blue.""

Rule:
- If the previous word is ""zup,"" then bluf = ""yellow"";
- Else, bluf = ""blue"".
Rule: walm -> repeating the color of the previous word three times. 

If the previous word is ""dax,"" which correlates with green, then ""walm"" results in ""green green green."" 
If the previous word is ""lug,"" which correlates with blue, then ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" 
If ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and ""wif"" has been established to correlate with red, then ""walm"" results in ""red red red.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is always ""green."" Therefore, the rule is that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided. Let's analyze the occurrences of ""wif"" and their corresponding output colors:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   - ""wif"" appears first and translates to ""red.""

2. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red
   - ""wif"" appears in the second position, and again, it translates to ""red.""

3. Input: wif zup bluf
   Output: red yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" is in the first position, and the corresponding output is ""red.""

4. Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
   - ""wif"" is the last word, and it corresponds to ""red.""

5. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   - ""wif"" appears in the third and fifth positions, and in both cases, it equates to ""red.""

From these patterns, it appears that regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input, it consistently corresponds to ""red"" in the output. The position does not influence its output color.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> the same color word that precedes it.

Rule: In each example where the word 'bluf' appears, it is translated as the same color word immediately before it in the input sequence.
walm -> repeat the color of the previous word

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" follows another word, the output color for ""walm"" is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word it directly follows.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output. The presence of other words such as ""dax"" and ""zup"" corresponds to other colors (""green"" and ""yellow"" respectively), but ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue"" regardless of the context it appears in.
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" appears to correspond to the color ""red."" Each time the word ""wif"" is used in the input, the output includes the color ""red.""

Here are the instances that show this association:

- In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""red red red.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" directly precedes ""red red.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" is followed by ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" comes before ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""red.""

Additionally, other words in the examples seem to correspond with other colors (e.g., ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" ""bluf"" with ""green,"" ""lug"" with ""blue""). However, ""wif"" consistently appears to relate only to the color red, irrespective of its position or the context within the sequence.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can analyze the examples provided and find a pattern between the input and output.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

Upon inspection, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the input sequence. Here are the rules I have discerned:

- If ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""
- If ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""
- If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""
- If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is that ""bluf"" represents the color corresponding to the word that comes right before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color value of the word before it.
Based on the given examples, we can analyze the pattern in which the word ""walm"" is used and the corresponding outputs. Here's the pattern breakdown:

Input: lug zup walm lug           Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
Input: zup walm lug wif bluf    Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
Input: lug dax walm                  Output: blue green green green
Input: zup lug walm wif walm    Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif  Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" ""wif"" maps to ""red"" followed by an additional ""red,"" and ""bluf"" maps to ""red"" repeated twice.

Observing the position of ""walm"" in each input sequence, we can see that it repeats the color that comes after it. The number of times it repeats appears to be three.

So, based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the next color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Regardless of the context provided in the examples, the output for ""lug"" is consistently ""blue."" Therefore, it can be inferred that the nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the given examples.
Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""wif"" by looking at the output each time ""wif"" appears.

From the examples:
1. ""wif dax zup bluf"" -> ""red green yellow yellow""
2. ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" -> ""yellow blue red green green red""
3. ""zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow green red""
4. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
5. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""blue red green green red blue""

It seems that whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the same position in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:
wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, we can see that the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color that describes the word that precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

1. dax -> green, zup -> yellow, bluf follows zup -> yellow
2. wif -> red, bluf follows wif -> red
3. wif -> red, zup -> yellow, dax -> green, bluf follows wif -> red
4. dax -> green, bluf follows dax -> green
5. zup -> yellow, lug -> blue, bluf follows zup (as lug repeats without bluf following directly) -> yellow

Considering this, the word ""bluf"" likely signifies the repetition of the color associated with the word directly preceding ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" influences the output by repeating the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. Each instance of ""walm"" mirrors the color of the word that comes right before it, and the number of times the color is repeated is one more than the number of letters in the word ""walm"" (which contains four letters, hence generating three repetitions).

Here's the breakdown of the inference:

- In the first example, ""dax zup dax walm,"" the color before ""walm"" is ""green,"" derived from ""dax,"" and it is repeated three times after ""walm.""

- In the second example, ""wif walm zup walm,"" the color ""red"" obtained from ""wif"" is repeated three times after the first ""walm,"" and the color ""yellow"" obtained from ""zup"" is repeated three times after the second ""walm.""

- In the third example, ""zup walm,"" the color before ""walm"" is ""yellow,"" so it is repeated three times.

- In the fourth example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" the color ""blue"" obtained from ""lug"" is repeated three times after ""walm.""

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in each provided example.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's examine the relationship between the input sequences and their corresponding output colors, looking for patterns that could help us infer a rule.

Here's a breakdown of the provided examples:

- Every time ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" is output.
- The word ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow.""
- The word ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red.""
- The word ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue.""
- The word ""walm"" and ""bluf"" don't have a consistent direct mapping but it appears that ""walm"" is related to ""green"" when followed by ""zup"".

Let's analyze the pattern of ""dax"" specifically:

1. ""dax wif zup dax"" -> ""green red yellow green""
2. ""dax walm zup"" -> ""green green green yellow""
3. ""wif dax lug"" -> ""red green blue""
4. ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow blue yellow yellow""
5. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""

""Dax"" consistently maps to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it. There are no examples where ""dax"" maps to any other color.

Given this information, we can deduce:

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or other context.

Therefore:

dax -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context.

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the given examples, every time the word ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" is outputted, regardless of the position of ""wif"" within the input. Therefore, the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" appears to replicate the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. Here are the mappings from the inputs to the outputs that help deduce the rule:

- zup corresponds to yellow, and when followed by bluf, it becomes ""yellow yellow"".
- wif corresponds to red, and when followed by bluf, it becomes ""red red"".
- dax corresponds to green, and when followed by bluf, it becomes ""green green"".
- In the last example with multiple words, each word that precedes bluf retains its original corresponding color followed immediately by a repetition of that color because of bluf.

So, the consistent rule in all examples is that bluf duplicates the color word that comes directly before it.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the word before it.
Based on the examples provided, we have the following mappings from inputs to outputs:

1. wif -> red
2. bluf -> blue
3. dax -> green
4. lug -> blue
5. zup -> yellow

Now, we need to analyze the occurrences of the nonce word ""walm"" to determine its meaning:

In example 1, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" maps to ""red red green green red red red blue red."" The sequence ""red red"" in the output occurs before and after ""walm"", suggesting that ""walm"" might mean ""red"".

In example 2, ""dax walm zup lug"" maps to ""green green green yellow blue."" ""Dax"" is ""green,"" and then ""walm"" is also ""green,"" followed by ""zup"" which is ""yellow"" and ""lug"" which is ""blue."" It seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it.

In example 3, ""dax walm"" maps to ""green green green."" Here, again, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color ""green"" of the word before it, ""dax.""

In example 4, ""wif walm dax zup"" maps to ""red red red green yellow."" ""Wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" again repeats this color before the sequence changes with ""dax"" which is ""green.""

In example 5, ""wif walm lug bluf"" maps to ""red red red blue blue."" ""Wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats this color, then the colors change as per the following words ""lug"" and ""bluf.""

In all examples, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the preceding word. Therefore, we can infer the following rule:

walm -> meaning. Meaning is that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that comes before it.

Rule: If a word precedes ""walm,"" then the output color associated with ""walm"" will be the same as the output color of the word that comes before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Justification: In every instance where the word ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue."" Hence, we can deduce that ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the input is ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, where ""bluf"" appears twice in succession, the output is two identical colors. When ""bluf"" appears once, it outputs the color that corresponds to the word preceding it. Therefore, it seems that ""bluf"" outputs the color of the most recent color word mentioned. 

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the previous color word mentioned. If no color word is mentioned before ""bluf,"" it defaults to red, as seen in the third example.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be associated with repeating the color of the immediate preceding word in the sequence. To identify the exact rule for ""walm,"" let's examine each provided input and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red 
   ""Wif"" corresponds to red, and following ""wif,"" ""walm"" repeats the color red twice more.

2. Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue 
   ""Dax"" corresponds to green and ""lug"" corresponds to blue. Following ""lug,"" ""walm"" repeats the color blue twice.

3. Input: lug walm wif bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red red
   Here, ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" repeats blue twice. ""Wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf,"" assuming it lines up with the color repetition, repeats red.

4. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm -> Output: green green green red blue green green green
   This sequence confirms previous observations where ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word. ""Dax"" is green and is repeated twice after ""walm,"" ""wif"" is red, ""lug"" is blue, followed by ""dax"" which is green again, and then ""walm"" repeats green three more times.

5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   ""Zup"" correlates to yellow and is repeated twice after ""walm."" ""Dax"" is green, ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" repeats red.

The rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it repeats the color of the immediate preceding word a number of times equal to the number of letters in the preceding color's name.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the immediately preceding word. The number of repetitions equals the number of letters in the color's name.
Example: ""lug walm"" is ""blue blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to blue, which has four letters, thus ""walm"" repeats the word blue three additional times to total four.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" correlates consistently with the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green.
Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the provided examples, every time the nonce word ""zup"" appears in an input, it corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output. The rule is consistent across different inputs, regardless of the other words present.
bluf -> the color of the word that precedes it. Rule: If a word precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" takes the color value of the preceding word. If ""bluf"" precedes another ""bluf,"" the color value continues from the last non-""bluf"" color word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the provided examples:

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow

Here ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The appearance of ""walm"" also generates ""red"" which is the same color corresponding to ""wif.""

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red

""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" ""dax"" produces ""green"" and ""lug"" produces ""blue."" ""walm"" aligns with ""green"" again, which follows ""dax.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

""dax"" produces ""green,"" followed by ""walm,"" which again corresponds to ""green.""

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" followed by ""walm,"" which also produces ""yellow.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

""dax"" leads to ""green"" output, and so does ""walm,"" which follows it.

Based on the above examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows: ""walm"" takes on the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. If ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" it is red, if by ""zup"" it is yellow, and if by ""dax"" it is green.

Rule: walm -> the word ""walm"" outputs the same color as the word immediately preceding it.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following mappings for the words:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue (since ""walm"" also yields ""blue"", it could be that ""lug"" indicates a single ""blue"" while ""walm"" represents a repeated ""blue"" or vice versa)

Now, looking at the use of ""dax"" in each example, it is always mapped to the word ""green"". There's no indication that ""dax"" means anything other than a single color as it does not appear to have any dependency on position or neighboring words.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in each example provided. Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present, ""wif"" always results in the output ""red"".
zup -> ""yellow""

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Rule: bluf -> red. The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red"" in every example provided.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repeating of the immediately preceding color three times. We can verify this rule by going through each input and its respective output:

1. In ""wif walm zup walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" after which ""walm"" occurs, leading to ""red red red."" After ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" ""walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

2. In ""zup wif lug zup walm"", ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and after the second ""zup,"" ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""

3. In ""wif zup walm dax zup"", ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" then ""walm"" induces ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" which follows the rule.

4. In ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" we note that ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""bluf"" is not associated with a color, ""wif"" is ""red,"" and following a repeat of ""wif,"" ""walm"" produces ""red red red."" Finally, ""lug"" comes again as ""blue.""

5. In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""walm"" therefore results in ""green green green.""

Given these observations, the rule is that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided.

From the given examples, the output is always a sequence of colors. The word 'dax' appears in each input and is associated with a particular color in the output. 

Let's look at the examples:

1. ""zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow green red""
2. ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" -> ""blue red red green blue blue""
3. ""zup dax lug"" -> ""yellow green blue""
4. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""
5. ""lug dax zup wif"" -> ""blue green yellow red""

Noticing the pattern, whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, we can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"". Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output. Therefore, the rule that can be inferred is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word 'zup' consistently translates to the color 'yellow'. Each time 'zup' appears in the input, the word 'yellow' appears in the corresponding output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" indicates the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

In each example, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green and ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. When ""bluf"" follows either of these words, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated once.

- For ""wif bluf dax walm,"" the output is ""red red green green green."" ""Wif"" associates with red, followed by ""bluf"" which repeats red, then ""dax"" associates with green and ""walm"" seems unrelated but also corresponds to green. The function of ""walm"" isn't completely clear, but it's not needed to determine the rule for ""bluf.""
- For ""dax bluf wif,"" the output is ""green green red,"" where ""dax"" is green and ""bluf"" repeats the green, followed by ""wif"" for red.
- For ""dax bluf,"" the output is ""green green,"" repeating the green associated with ""dax.""
- For ""wif bluf,"" the output is ""red red,"" repeating the red associated with ""wif.""
- For ""wif bluf dax,"" the output is ""red red green,"" where ""wif"" is red, ""bluf"" repeats the red, and ""dax"" changes the color to green.

With this pattern, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"" as follows:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word.
walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word.

Rule: When the word 'walm' appears, its color output is the same as the color output of the word immediately before it. If ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output for ""walm"" is blue, as ""lug"" is associated with blue. If ""wif"" is before ""walm,"" the output would be red, as ""wif"" results in red, and so on.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it.
Based on the examples provided, we can observe that the output color that follows the nonce word ""walm"" is the same as the color that immediately precedes it. For instance, if ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" then the next color is also ""yellow."" Similarly, if ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" then the next output color is also ""green.""

Let's verify the rule with each example:

1. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), and the color after ""walm"" is ""blue.""

2. Input: dax walm zup lug

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in all given examples.
Based on the examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a repeated color in the output. In each case, the word ""bluf"" is translated into two reds or two blues in the output. The rule appears to depend on the word that comes before ""bluf."" 

If ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""

If ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue.""

There are no examples with ""bluf"" following any other words, so it is not possible to deduce what ""bluf"" means after other words with the information provided. However, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" doubles the color output of the word immediately preceding it in the input sequence.

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color denoted by the word preceding it. If preceded by ""wif"" it outputs ""red red"", and if preceded by ""lug"" it outputs ""blue blue"".
walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word. Rule: The output color of ""walm"" is a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it. If ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" ""walm"" results in the color green being repeated three times. If ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" ""walm"" results in the color red being repeated three times.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the rule is as follows: 

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the rule for what ""dax"" means in these examples, let's examine each input and its corresponding output, looking for patterns.

Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
Output: green green red yellow green
We see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" both at the beginning and the end of the sequence.

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow
Once again, ""dax"" leads to ""green"".

Input: dax bluf wif
Output: green green red
""dax"" continues to correspond to ""green"".

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
""dax"" at the beginning results in ""green"".

Input: lug bluf dax lug
Output: blue blue green blue
Here, ""dax"" is surrounded by other words but still corresponds to ""green"".

Based on these examples, we can deduce that ""dax"" is consistently mapped to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Therefore, we can state the rule as follows:

Rule: dax -> green

Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the output will be ""green"" for that position.
wif -> red

Rule: Each occurrence of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the output color red, independent of its position in the input sequence.
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the position and output of each example where ""bluf"" appears.

1. wif bluf dax -> red red green
2. zup wif dax wif bluf -> yellow red green red red
3. wif bluf lug -> red red blue
4. dax bluf wif -> green green red
5. wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green

Now, let's look at what happens around ""bluf"":

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red. Since ""wif"" alone also translates to red, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word before it.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (in the fourth input), it results in green, which is the same as ""dax."" 
- When ""bluf"" is before ""lug,"" the output is blue, which is also the color associated with ""lug.""
- ""bluf"" seems to take on the color value of the word that immediately precedes it.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Bluf -> meaning: Bluf takes on the color value of the word immediately before it. 

Rule: If a word X precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is the color associated with the word X.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to always result in a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. In each example, the output repeats the color coded to the word before ""walm"" three times.

Here are the breakdowns:

- ""dax walm lug"" -> ""green green green blue"" (repeats the color of ""dax"" three times before providing the color of ""lug"")
- ""lug walm zup"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow"" (repeats the color of ""lug"" three times before providing the color of ""zup"")
- ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red"" (repeats the color of ""wif"" three times with no subsequent color)
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" (repeats the color of ""lug"" three times with no subsequent color)
- ""dax zup dax walm"" -> ""green yellow green green green"" (provides the colors for ""dax"" and ""zup"" and then repeats the color of the last ""dax"" three times)

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in an input, it indicates that the output should repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. If there is another word following ""walm,"" its associated color is provided after the three repetitions.

So:

walm -> meaning. Rule: Repeat the color of the preceding word three times. If there is another word after ""walm,"" provide its associated color afterward.

Rule: Whenever the word 'dax' appears in the input, the word 'green' appears in the output, regardless of the position of 'dax' within the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" While other words in the input, such as ""dax"" and ""lug,"" correspond to other colors (""green"" and ""blue"" respectively), ""wif"" is always associated with ""red,"" regarldess of position or combination with other words.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples.
Based on the examples given, it appears that ""bluf"" effects the output by duplicating the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

1. In ""wif dax bluf,"" the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax"" which translates to ""green."" The output is ""red green green,"" which means ""bluf"" has caused ""green"" to repeat.
2. In ""dax wif bluf,"" the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif"" which translates to ""red."" The output is ""green red red,"" meaning ""bluf"" has caused ""red"" to repeat.
3. In ""lug bluf zup lug,"" the word before ""bluf"" is ""lug,"" corresponding to ""blue."" The output is ""blue blue yellow blue,"" which confirms ""bluf"" doubling the preceding ""blue.""
4. In ""dax bluf wif zup wif,"" the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax"" (green). The output after ""bluf"" is ""green green,"" which also includes the repeating pattern, with ""green"" being doubled.
5. In ""dax bluf zup,"" the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax” (green) resulting in ""green green"" immediately after ""bluf,"" with the pattern being consistent.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning: repeat the color of the preceding word.
Analyzing the examples:

1. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
   
   ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"" and ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"", so ""lug"" must lead to ""blue"".
   
2. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   
   Here, ""dax"" yields ""green"", ""wif walm"" again leads to ""red red red"".
   
3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
   ""lug"" independently leads to ""blue"" but followed by ""walm"" it repeats the color ""blue"".
   
4. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   
   ""zup"" gives ""yellow"", ""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue"", and ""wif walm"" still gives ""red red red"".
   
5. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   
   ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" gives ""green green green"", ""zup"" gives ""yellow"", and ""lug"" gives ""blue"".

From these examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the word color that precedes it to repeat three times. 

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug wif
    ",Output: green blue red,green blue red,True,189
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each provided example.
Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" independent of context.
To determine the meaning (or rule) of ""bluf,"" let's look at the resemblance between each input and its respective output to figure out any patterns:

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Input: wif lug zup bluf
Output: red blue yellow yellow

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Input: dax lug bluf dax
Output: green blue blue green

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

From these examples, ""bluf"" seems to result in an output color that mirrors the color of the word just before it:

- In the first example, ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" and following ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" again results in ""yellow,"" following ""bluf,"" the output is again ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" results in ""red,"" following ""bluf,"" the output is again ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" following ""bluf,"" the output is also ""blue,"" and ""dax"" after ""bluf"" mirrors ""green,"" which is the output for ""dax.""
- In the fifth example, each instance of ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" and following ""bluf,"" the output is also ""blue.""

Rule:
bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples given, each instance of ""walm"" seems to correspond to a color being repeated three times. The color appears to be determined by the word that comes immediately before ""walm."" Here is the observed pattern:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" so ""lug"" seems to correspond to blue and ""walm"" causes a repetition of blue three times.
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" indicating that ""dax"" corresponds to green, with ""walm"" repeating green three times.
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" meaning ""wif"" should correspond to red, and ""walm"" repeats red three times.

Additionally:

- In the first example, ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" Here, ""zup"" doesn't directly precede a ""walm,"" so it only appears once as yellow, while ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" resulting in ""blue"" being repeated three times. When ""lug"" appears after ""walm,"" it presents as a single ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" and again, as ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" it leads to the color red being repeated three times. The same principle applies to ""zup"" preceding the second instance of ""walm,"" resulting in yellow being repeated three times, with the presence of ""lug"" in between resulting in a single blue.

Rule: walm -> causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word 'dax' consistently corresponds to the output 'green'. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we should look for patterns in the input and output.

From the first input and output pair:
- ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red.""

From the second input and output pair:
- ""dax wif walm"" corresponds to ""green red red red.""

From the third input and output pair:
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

From the fourth input and output pair:
- ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" corresponds to ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow.""

From the fifth input and output pair:
- ""dax bluf wif"" corresponds to ""green green red.""

Every instance of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Whenever ""zup"" is used in the input, ""yellow"" is included in the output, maintaining positional correspondence (i.e., wherever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output).

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" follows another word, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated. Each given word (e.g., 'wif', 'zup', 'lug', 'dax') corresponds to a unique color:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

Thus, ""bluf"" instructs the system to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it.
Rule:
Walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

Explanation:
Each instance of ""walm"" in the examples results in the previous word's corresponding color being repeated three times.

- dax is associated with green, as seen in ""dax walm"" which outputs ""green green green"".
- lug is associated with blue, as seen in ""lug walm"" which outputs ""blue blue blue"".
- wif is associated with red, as seen in ""wif walm"" which outputs ""red red red"".
- When ""walm"" follows a color word, that color is repeated three times as the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug dax wif walm
    ",Output: red blue green red red red,red blue green red red red,True,191
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Considering the consistency of 'lug' across different examples, it reliably translates to the color 'blue'. This is evident because regardless of the other words present or their order, 'lug' consistently results in 'blue' in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word 'lug' appears in the input, the word 'blue' appears in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word 'dax' corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position within the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""wif,"" I'll examine the placement of the word in the input and the corresponding output:

1. ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red""
2. ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
3. ""lug wif"" -> ""blue red""
4. ""lug wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue red blue blue""
5. ""lug walm wif lug"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue""

Based on the examples, every time ""wif"" appears, it corresponds to the output ""red."" Its position relative to other words does not seem to change this output. No matter what word comes before or after ""wif,"" it is consistently translated to ""red."" Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word zup consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should examine the outputs that accompany its occurrence and compare them to the elements proceeding ""bluf"" in the input. Here are the observations based on the inputs and outputs provided:

1. ""wif bluf"" yields ""red red,"" which shows that ""bluf"" might be related to the word that comes before it, and in this case, it adopts the same color as ""wif.""
2. ""lug dax bluf"" turns into ""blue green green,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output doubles the color associated with ""dax,"" which means that ""bluf"" potentially means to repeat the color that comes immediately before it.
3. ""dax zup bluf"" becomes ""green yellow yellow,"" again showing that ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word right before it, ""zup"" in this case.
4. ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red red green blue blue."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the color ""red"" is repeated. Further down, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and the color ""blue"" is repeated.
5. ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" results in ""blue green green red green."" As before, ""bluf"" after ""dax"" causes the ""green"" color to repeat.

From these observations, we can induce that the rule associated with ""bluf"" is to repeat the color output that corresponds to the word that comes immediately before ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.
To decipher the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine its usage in relation to the output colors:

- In every instance, ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of identical colors in the output.
- The number of colors in the sequence corresponds to the number of times the preceding word appears before ""walm."" 
- The color itself correlates with the preceding word: ""wif walm"" -> red, ""lug walm"" -> blue, ""dax walm"" -> green, ""zup walm"" -> yellow.

Rule: ""walm"" triggers a repetition in the output of the color associated with the preceding word. The number of repetitions is equal to the number of times the preceding word has appeared in the input sequence up to that point.

Let's write it out:

walm -> Triggers a sequence of colors in the output that corresponds to the preceding word, with the number of repetitions equal to the frequency of the preceding word in the input up to that point.

For example:
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and it appears three times before ""walm.""
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and it appears three times before ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of the context in which it appears.
Based on the examples given, it appears that ""dax"" is consistently translated to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it. Therefore, the meaning of ""dax"" seems to be independent of context within these examples.

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position within the sequence of words.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that represents the word preceding it. 

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and ""dax"", which correspond to the colors yellow and green, respectively. Therefore, it translates to ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"" and ""green"" when it follows ""dax"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which means it translates to ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", so it translates to ""blue"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which means it translates to ""red"".
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" again follows ""zup"", translating to ""yellow"".

bluf -> The color that corresponds to the word directly preceding it.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to affect the color output corresponding to the preceding word in a consistent way. If we examine the relationship between the input and the output, we can identify patterns that help us deduce the meaning of ""walm.""

Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   Here, after ""walm,"" the color that ""zup"" represents (yellow) is repeated, and only the last word ""wif"" changes the color to red.

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Similarly, after ""walm,"" ""wif"" represents the color red, and it repeats until the end of the sequence.

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   After ""walm,"" the color that ""dax"" represents (green) is repeated.

4. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   After ""walm,"" the color that ""wif"" represents (red) is repeated.

5. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   After ""walm,"" the color that ""zup"" represents (yellow) is repeated, and only the last word ""wif"" changes the color to red.

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that appears directly before it in the sequence up until the next word. If there's no word following ""walm,"" the color of the previous word just keeps repeating. Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to repeat until another word appears. If no word follows, the last mentioned color repeats indefinitely.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif bluf lug walm dax lug dax
    ",Output: red red blue blue blue blue green blue green green,red red blue blue blue green blue green,False,193
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output. Each instance of the word ""dax"" in the input is matched with the word ""green"" in the output regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, we can conclude the following rule:

dax -> green
Based on the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" can be stated simply as:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Moreover, each of the other words seems to correspond to a specific color:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue

So, putting it all together:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns in the provided examples:

1. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue

2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

3. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

4. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

5. Input: wif zup bluf
   Output: red yellow yellow

By comparing the input with its corresponding output, we can make the following observations:
- The presence of ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax"" correspond to colors ""red,"" ""yellow,"" and ""green,"" respectively.
- The word ""wif"" appears in the input it results in ""red"" in the output.
- The word ""zup"" appears in the input it results in ""yellow"" in the output.
- The word ""dax"" appears in the input it results in ""green"" in the output.
- The word ""lug"" does not have a corresponding color, as it's removed from the output of the second example.
- The word ""walm"" does not have a corresponding color and is removed from the output as seen in the second example.
- When we see ""bluf,"" it is always translated to ""yellow"" in the output except when it is the last word; in that case, it translates to ""blue.""

Based on these patterns, we can infer that ""bluf"" at the end of any sequence translates to ""blue"" in the output. However, when ""bluf"" is not at the end, it translates to ""yellow.""

Rule:
bluf -> ""blue"" when at the end of the sequence; ""yellow"" otherwise.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to dictate the output of colors in triplicate form. Each instance of ""walm"" results in the same color being repeated three times. Here's the breakdown of the given examples:

- ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" necessitates the color to be repeated three times.
- ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red,"" indicating ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" again dictates the color is repeated three times.
- The presence of ""wif"" and ""dax"" along with ""walm"" in the input ""dax walm wif dax"" results in ""green green green red green."" ""Dax"" corresponds to green, but when paired with ""walm,"" we get three greens. Then ""wif"" is red, followed by a single ""dax,"" which is green.
- In the input ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" the sequence ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"" suggests that ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""bluf"" also corresponds to blue, and ""wif"" corresponds to red. ""Walm"" after ""wif"" causes the red to be repeated three times.
- Finally, ""zup walm wif"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" supporting that ""zup"" is yellow, ""walm"" causes the repetition of the yellow three times, and ""wif"" is red.

With these observations, we can deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the prior color word to be outputted three times in a row.

Therefore:

walm -> Repeats the previous color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,194
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" by comparing the input and output patterns:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output when it follows ""zup wif"".
- In the second example, it also corresponds to ""green"" when it is preceded by ""zup"".
- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when it follows another ""dax"" and when it is preceded by ""zup""; ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" as well.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" alone following ""zup"" corresponds to ""green"".
- In the fifth example, it corresponds to ""green"" when it follows ""bluf"".

From all the examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"", regardless of its position or the words that come before or after it. Therefore, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in every example provided.
zup -> yellow. Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow"".
bluf -> repeat the color of the word before it. Rule: When the word ""bluf"" appears in the sequence, it adopts the color associated with the word directly preceding it. If ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" then ""bluf"" following either word takes on the same color. For example, ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow"" indicating that ""bluf"" takes the color of ""zup"", which is yellow. Similarly, ""dax bluf"" outputs ""green green"" showing that ""bluf"" takes the color green from ""dax"".
walm -> repetition of the last color mentioned. Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" is encountered in a sequence, it causes the color associated with the last mentioned color word to be repeated multiple times. For instance, if the last color word was ""lug"" (blue), then the output following ""walm"" will be multiple instances of the word ""blue"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, we can hypothesize that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Each input that contains the word ""dax"" has a corresponding ""green"" in the same position in the output sequence. To be more specific:

- Input: dax wif - Output: green red
- Input: lug dax - Output: blue green
- Input: lug dax zup lug wif - Output: blue green yellow blue red
- Input: dax - Output: green
- Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm - Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

In each case, ""dax"" translates directly to ""green"" regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word 'wif' always corresponds to the color 'red' regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, ""zup"" seems to correspond with a specific color output, with the quantity of that color matching the number of times a non-""zup"" word appears after ""zup"" before the next ""zup"" or the end of input. To confirm:

- In the first example, ""zup"" is followed by three words, with the second ""zup"" following thereafter, each ""zup"" leads to a single ""yellow"".
- In the second example, between the first ""zup"" and the second ""zup"", there are two non-""zup"" words (""dax bluf""), which outputs ""yellow green green"", and then there's a single ""red"" (from ""wif"") and another ""yellow"" from the second ""zup"", followed by two ""bluf"" words translated to ""yellow"", and finally ""lug"" turns into ""blue"".
- In the third example, ""zup"" precedes three ""walm"", so it outputs three ""yellow"" before turning each ""walm"" into ""blue"".
- In the fourth example, two non-""zup"" words are before ""zup"", and they repeat their colors. Then after ""zup"", two ""walm"" words follow, which translates into double ""yellow"" before each of them turns into ""blue"".
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" is directly followed by ""walm"", which results in a triple ""yellow"" output.

Rule: ""zup"" outputs the color ""yellow"" repeatedly, with the number of repetitions equating the quantity of subsequent words (that are not ""zup"") until the next ""zup"" or the end of the input.

zup -> a sequence of ""yellow"" whose length is determined by the number of words following it until the next ""zup"" or end of input.
Based on the provided examples, we can derive a pattern that links the input words to the output colors. Here's the breakdown:

1. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow: ""bluf"" corresponds to the last ""yellow""
2. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue: ""bluf"" corresponds to the last ""blue""
3. zup bluf -> yellow yellow: ""bluf"" corresponds to the last ""yellow""
4. zup bluf -> yellow yellow: ""bluf"" corresponds to the last ""yellow""
5. dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green: ""bluf"" corresponds to the second last ""red""

We observe that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that immediately precedes it. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" in the sequence.
Rule:
walm -> The output of ""walm"" is to repeat the color of the immediately preceding word in the input sequence three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue
dax -> green repeated once for each occurrence of the word immediately following ""dax"".

Rule:
- When the word following ""dax"" is said once (e.g., ""bluf""), ""green"" is repeated once.
- When the word following ""dax"" is repeated (e.g., ""walm walm""), ""green"" is repeated the same number of times as the following word.
wif -> meaning: red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red,"" regardless of the context in which it appears within the given examples.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in the provided input and output pairs. Here's what we can observe:

1. In each instance where ""bluf"" is present in the input, there are two consecutive ""yellow"" colors in the output.
2. ""bluf"" does not correspond to only one single color; rather, it seems to cause a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word directly preceding it.

With these observations, we can define a rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another word in the input, the color corresponding to that word is repeated in the output.

Thus:

bluf -> Repetition of the preceding word's corresponding color.
Observing the given examples, let's try to deduce the rule governing the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

1. Input: wif lug walm -> Output: red blue blue blue
2. Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue
3. Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green
4. Input: wif dax lug walm -> Output: red green blue blue blue
5. Input: lug walm wif zup wif -> Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

Let's look at the occurrences of ""walm"" and see if we can understand its transformation into a color or a pattern:

- In all instances where ""walm"" appears, it is translated into a repetitive sequence of the color blue.
- Inputs without ""walm"" do not have a repeating pattern of blue.
- Based on example 5, ""walm"" does not seem to affect any colors that come after it.
- It seems like each instance of ""walm"" in the input results in three instances of the word ""blue"" in the output.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it translates directly into three repetitions of the word ""blue"" in the output, irrespective of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words.

Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the word ""blue"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax bluf wif lug
    ",Output: blue green green red blue,blue green green red blue,True,197
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" 

In each instance, whenever the word ""lug"" appears, the word ""blue"" is used in the corresponding output. There is no indication that the meaning of ""lug"" changes depending on its placement within the sequence or the presence of other words. Therefore, we deduce:

lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Regardless of its position in the input sequence or other words present, ""dax"" always results in ""green"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule is: dax -> green.
Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. 

""wif"" -> red
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup,"" and ""blue"" when it follows ""lug"" or appears at the end of the sequence. However, when following ""dax"" or ""wif,"" there isn't a consistent color associated with ""bluf."" Here are the observed patterns:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
2. lug bluf -> blue blue
3. dax bluf -> yellow (but this pattern only appears once, so it's not consistent)
4. bluf at the end -> blue
5. wif bluf -> blue (but this pattern only appears once, so it's not consistent)

Considering the inconsistency and based on the available data, we can't deduce a clear single meaning for ""bluf."" However, given more examples, especially involving ""dax bluf"" and ""wif bluf,"" a clearer rule may emerge. For now, it appears that ""bluf"" may mean ""yellow"" following ""zup,"" ""blue"" following ""lug,"" or ""blue"" when at the end of the sequence. 

Rule: 
- After ""zup"" or at the end of a sequence, ""bluf"" means ""yellow.""
- After ""lug,"" ""bluf"" means ""blue.""
- The meaning of ""bluf"" after ""dax"" or ""wif"" is unclear with the given data.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's break down each input and output pair to see if we can find a pattern.

1. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   
2. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   
3. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

4. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

Now, we examine the position and repetition of ""walm"" as well as the corresponding output colour pattern:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"" and the output for ""walm"" is ""green green green"". ""Walm"" hence appears to convert a single colour to three of the same colour.
- In the second example, ""walm"" again causes the output to become three of the same colour of the previous word - ""green"" becomes ""green green green"" and ""wif"" becomes ""red red red"".
- In the third example, ""walm"" is placed after ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"" and the output for ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In the fourth example, with ""walm"" following ""zup"" which is ""yellow"" in the output, ""walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" following ""wif"" which is ""red"" in the output, ""walm"" yields ""red red red"".

From this pattern, we can infer that ""walm"" translates to repeating the color word of the word immediately before it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,198
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a color:

- ""wif"" seems to correspond to red;
- ""lug"" seems to correspond to blue;
- ""walm"" seems to correspond to red when following ""wif"" and blue when following ""lug"";
- ""zup"" seems to correspond to yellow.

By examining the position of ""dax"" and its corresponding output, we can try to deduce its meaning or rule:

- In example 1, ""dax"" follows ""wif"" (red) and precedes ""lug"" (blue), and the output is green.
- In example 2, ""dax"" is the first word and is followed by ""lug"" (blue), and the output is green.
- In example 3, ""dax"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and precedes ""lug"" (blue), and the output is green.
- In example 4, ""dax"" follows ""wif"" (red) and is followed by ""lug"" (blue), and the output is green again.
- In example 5, ""dax"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and the output is still green.

From these examples, it looks like ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position relative to the other words or their assigned colors.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples given, it appears that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" This is evident from the consistent presence of ""red"" in the Output immediately following the word ""wif."" To check the consistency of this rule, let's examine each example:

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" which implies ""walm"" translates to ""red"" as well, and ""wif"" is ""red.""
- In the second example, ""dax wif bluf"" results in ""green red red,"" indicating ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" is also ""red.""
- In the third example, ""lug wif bluf"" results in ""blue red red,"" indicating ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" is confirmed to be ""red"" again.
- In the fourth example, ""zup wif dax"" results in ""yellow red green,"" indicating ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""dax"" is confirmed to be ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif lug"" results in ""red blue,"" which is consistent with ""wif"" being ""red"" and ""lug"" being ""blue.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we see that the appearance of the nonce word ""zup"" is always followed by the output of ""yellow."" Therefore, we can deduce that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to result in an output that repeats the color word preceding it. Here's a breakdown:

1. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue green green."" The word ""dax"" which translates to ""green"" is immediately followed by ""bluf,"" and the output for ""bluf"" in this instance is ""green.""

2. ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red."" Here ""wif"" which means ""red"" is followed by ""bluf,"" resulting in another ""red.""

3. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" In this case, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and is followed by ""bluf,"" giving us another ""yellow.""

4. The repeated example ""zup bluf -> yellow yellow"" confirms the pattern identified in example 3.

5. ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" which means ""yellow"" is immediately followed by ""bluf,"" leading to the repetition of ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> the meaning is to repeat the color word that immediately precedes it.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we begin by analyzing the examples provided, comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs. Here are the examples provided again with a clearer comparison:

Input: zup wif walm lug               -> Output: yellow red red red blue
Input: lug zup walm lug               -> Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
Input: lug walm wif lug bluf          -> Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
Input: zup wif lug zup walm           -> Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif  -> Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

Analyzing the outputs and considering the position of ""walm"" in the inputs, it appears that ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of the color that corresponds to the immediately preceding word. For example, when ""wif"" (red) precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red red."" When ""zup"" (yellow) precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow,"" and so on. Additionally, ""walm"" does not just double the color; it repeats the color until the next new color appears. 

Therefore:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word until a different color appears in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup wif dax
    ",Output: yellow red green,yellow red green,True,199
