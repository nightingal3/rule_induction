"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of the word ""dax"" by comparing its position and usage with the corresponding output:

Output: green blue red
Here, ""dax"" precedes ""lug"" and the output starts with ""green"".

Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
Output: green blue yellow red red green
Here, ""dax"" is at the beginning and end of the sequence. The output correspondingly starts and ends with ""green"".

Input: dax lug wif lug

Again, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"" and the output starts with ""green"". 

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
Here, ""dax"" appears at the end and the output, correspondingly, ends with ""green"".

Input: wif dax lug
Output: red green blue
Here, ""dax"" is in the middle and followed by ""lug""; the output is ""red green blue"" where ""green"" is in the middle.

From these examples, we can induce that the occurrence of the word ""dax"" maps to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,0,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can discern a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" and other words used in the examples. Let's analyze them:

2. When the word ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue.""
3. When the word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
4. When the word ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""
5. When the word ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""red.""

From these observations, we can determine the meaning associated with each word. Specifically for ""dax,"" each occurrence corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" has a consistent representation in the output.

"Based on the given examples where the nonce word ""wif"" is used, we can deduce the following rule:

Given this consistency across all examples, it suggests that ""wif"" translates to the color red.

"Rule: wif -> red

Each instance of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""",1.0,0,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears at the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,0,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that each unique word corresponds to a specific color:

- zup consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow""
- dax consistently corresponds to the color ""green""
- lug consistently corresponds to the color ""blue""
- wif, when it appears, corresponds to the color ""red""

Given this, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,0,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"".",1.0,0,zup
"zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in all given examples, regardless of position or other words present.",1.0,0,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine how it appears in the input and what the corresponding output is for those instances.

- In example 1, when ""bluf"" is between two ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow red red yellow."" Given that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" both before and after ""bluf,"" it could imply that ""bluf"" results in repeating the color ""red"" for each occurrence of ""bluf.""

- In example 2, ""bluf"" appears after ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green."" This pattern further supports the rule from the first example since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" based on other examples, suggesting that ""bluf"" must be generating a double of the preceding color.

- In example 3, ""bluf"" appears followed by ""wif lug wif walm lug,"" and the corresponding output is ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" Since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" is both preceded and followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" we again see the doubling effect.

- In example 4, ""bluf"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif lug."" The output for ""dax bluf"" is ""green green,"" and the output for ""wif lug"" is ""red blue."" Since this maintains the consistent output for ""dax"" and ""lug,"" it suggests that ""bluf"" is consistent in its effect.

- In example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""zup wif,"" and the output is ""yellow red red."" Considering that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" we are again seeing a pattern where ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the color that directly precedes it.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> ""bluf"" results in the output repeating the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning: bluf causes the word immediately prior to ""bluf"" to be outputted twice.",1.0,0,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the appearance of the nonce word ""bluf"" in the input correlates with the appearance of two reds in the output. Every time ""bluf"" is present, the output consists of ""red red"" regardless of the other words surrounding it. The other words in the input (zup, wif, dax, lug, walm) each seem to correlate with their own unique color in the output (yellow, red, green, blue, red, respectively). Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" correlates with the output of two consecutive ""red"" colors. 

Thus: bluf -> red red",1.0,0,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red red

The word 'bluf' consistently translates to ""red red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,0,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to look for patterns in the inputs and outputs:

- In the first input ""zup wif bluf zup,"" the output is ""yellow red red yellow."" 
  We see the pattern:
  ""zup"" = yellow
  ""wif"" = red (since ""zup"" is sandwiched between ""wif"" and ""bluf"", so the repeated instance of ""yellow"" at the end implies that ""zup"" is yellow and ""bluf"" is also contributing to ""red"").

- In the second input ""dax bluf,"" the output is ""green green."" This indicates that ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and ""bluf"" once again seems to be generically causing a repeat of the previous color.

- In the third input ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" the output is ""blue blue red blue red red red blue.""
  Here we see:
  ""lug"" = blue
  ""wif"" = red (consistent with the first example)
  ""walm"" = red (unknown, but by deduction from repetition of ""red,"" it would seem ""walm"" is equivalent to ""red"" here)

- In the fourth input ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug,"" the output is ""blue red green green red blue."" This reinforces the notion that ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""dax"" with green. ""Bluf"" once again causes a repetition of the previous color term.

- In the fifth input ""zup wif bluf,"" the output is ""yellow red red."" This is consistent with the pattern we've seen where ""zup"" equals ""yellow,"" ""wif"" equals ""red,"" and ""bluf"" causes the previous color to repeat.

Given these examples, we can deduce the general rule for the nonce word ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the previous color term to repeat.

So, the meaning of ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> causes the repetition of the preceding color.",1.0,0,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in each input and its corresponding output:

1. zup wif bluf zup -> yellow red red yellow
2. dax bluf -> green green
3. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue
4. lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> blue red green green red blue
5. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red

By examining the patterns, we can observe the following:

- In example 1, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and where ""bluf"" appears between two ""zup"" words, the corresponding output is ""red red"".
- In example 2, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and where ""bluf"" immediately follows ""dax"", the corresponding output is ""green"".
- In example 3, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and where ""bluf"" immediately follows ""lug"", the corresponding output is ""blue"".
- In example 4, despite the mix of ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax,"" when ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" it corresponds to ""green green,"" and when it comes after ""lug"" it corresponds to ""blue blue.""
- In example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""zup wif"" just as in example 1, and the corresponding output is again ""red red.""

From these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it and duplicates it. Therefore, if ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""red red""; if it follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green""; and if it follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue"".

Based on the evidence, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> duplicating the color associated with the preceding word.",0.8,0,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that comes directly before it three times. Each nonce word except ""walm"" seems to correlate with a specific color:

- ""wif"" correlates with the color red.
- ""zup"" correlates with the color yellow.
- ""dax"" correlates with the color green.
- ""lug"" correlates with the color blue.

Therefore, when ""walm"" follows any of these words, the color linked to the preceding word is repeated thrice in the output.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.",1.0,0,walm
"From the provided examples, it is seen that ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of a color word three times. Let's break down each example:

1. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   * Here, ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and with the addition of ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   * Here, ""zup"" must be associated with ""yellow,"" and again ""walm"" causes this word to be repeated three times.

3. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   * ""Dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and results in ""green"" repeated three times, while ""wif walm"" results in ""red"" repeated three times as previously established.

4. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   * ""Zup walm"" results in ""yellow"" repeated three times, ""lug"" possibly translates to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" without ""walm"" translates to just ""red.""

5. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   * This is identical to the first example and confirms the pattern of ""wif walm"" resulting in ""red red red.""

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color related to the preceding word three times.

So, based on the above examples and analysis:

walm -> meaning. The word ""walm"" causes the color word that precedes it to be repeated three times.",1.0,0,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond to the repetition of the color that is associated with the word that precedes it. Here's how the rule applies in each example:

1. ""wif walm"": wif is associated with red; hence walm means red is repeated thrice.
2. ""zup walm"": zup is associated with yellow; hence walm means yellow is repeated thrice.
3. ""dax walm"": dax is associated with green; hence walm means green is repeated thrice. ""wif walm"" follows the same pattern as before with red.
4. ""zup walm lug wif"": zup is associated with yellow for walm to repeat thrice, while lug is associated with blue, followed by ""wif"" which is red.

In each case, walm requires the previous color to be repeated three times. Therefore, the rule we can deduce for walm is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,0,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to correlate consistently with a repetition of the color that the preceding word represents. Here is the rule induction from the examples:

- ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red,"" so ""wif"" likely means ""red,"" and ""walm"" indicates a repetition of this color thrice.
- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""zup"" likely means ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" indicates a repetition of this color thrice.
- ""dax walm wif walm"" outputs ""green green green red red red,"" so ""dax"" could mean ""green,"" and ""walm"" follows by repeating the color given by the preceding word three times.
- ""zup walm lug wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow blue red,"" so ""lug"" possibly means ""blue."" ""zup walm"" repeats yellow three times, ""lug"" gives blue once, and ""wif"" gives red once, with no ""walm"" after the last two colors, hence they only appear one time each.

From this, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> repetition of the prior mentioned color three times.",1.0,0,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to be associated with a repetition of the color that precedes it. Here's how we can deduce this:

Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red
- ""wif"" is translated to ""red,"" and ""walm"" seems to cause the color ""red"" to be repeated three times.

Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and again, ""walm"" causes the color ""yellow"" to be repeated three times.

Input: dax walm wif walm -> Output: green green green red red red
- ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" which is then repeated three times due to ""walm,"" followed by the ""wif"" and ""walm"" sequence, which, as previously established, repeats ""red"" three times.

Input: zup walm lug wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" which is repeated three times because of ""walm""; ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" with no repetitions following these colors, indicating their lack of coupling with ""walm.""

Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red
- This input-output pair is consistent with the first example and supports the established pattern.

Therefore, the nonce word ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" translates consistently to the word ""red"". To confirm, let's look at the patterns:

- Whenever ""bluf"" is present in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.
- The position of ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to the position of ""red"" in the output.
- Other words correlate with different colors (e.g., ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"").
- The word ""bluf"" does not seem to affect the translation of the words that come before or after it, reinforcing that ""bluf"" has a straightforward one-to-one correspondence with ""red"".

Rule: bluf -> red",0.0,1,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to examine the patterns in the given examples. Let's take a closer look at each instance where ""walm"" appears and its output:

1. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   
2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   
3. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   
4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   
5. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow

From the examples given, it seems that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word just before ""walm"" three times. For instance:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""

Moreover, ""walm"" does not appear on its own; it always directly follows another word. There are no counterexamples given to suggest that ""walm"" has any other function.

Hence, we can deduce:

walm -> meaning. Rule: ""walm"" is a function that repeats the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.",1.0,1,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

- Walm -> meaning: When ""walm"" is used after a word, it repeats the output color associated with the preceding word three times.

Here's the rule applied to each example:
1. ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"", so ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" causes the triple repetition.
2. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"", which indicates that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""walm"" triggers the repetition.
3. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" yields ""blue blue blue red yellow red"". Thus, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""walm"" induces the repetition of ""blue"" three times, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" again for ""red"".
4. ""dax walm"" repeating the earlier pattern gives ""green green green"".
5. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" produces ""green green green red red red yellow"". We see that after ""dax"", ""walm"" causes ""green"" to repeat three times, after ""wif"", ""walm"" causes ""red"" to repeat three times, and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

Rule: walm -> when following a color-word, causes the output color associated with that word to be repeated three times.",1.0,1,walm

- ""walm"" translates to ""blue"" when following other words (except when preceded directly by ""wif""), otherwise ""red""

Using these translations, we see that ""wif"" is always followed by the color ""red"" in the output. However, a noticeable pattern is that when ""wif"" is immediately followed by a word that corresponds to a color, the output color for ""wif"" is ""red"", and the word after ""wif"" retains its respective color. This is consistent across all examples. Thus, ""wif"" acts as a color indicator that does not change the subsequent word's color.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,2,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" correlates directly to the color ""red"" regardless of its position among the other words. Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding output.

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the same position in the output.",1.0,2,wif
"Based on the examples provided:

- whenever ""wif"" precedes another word, the output is ""red"" followed by the color corresponding to that word.

- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""

1. Input: wif bluf        -> Output: red red

2. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf  -> Output: yellow red green red red

3. Input: zup bluf dax  -> Output: yellow yellow green

1. Every time ""dax"" appears at the beginning or end of a sequence, or follows the word ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
2. When other non-""dax"" words are present between instances of ""dax,"" we can infer the following associated colors:

   - ""wif"" is associated with ""red""
   - ""bluf"" is consistently associated with ""green""
   - ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" is associated with ""red""

- In all instances, ""dax"" precedes colors in the output sequence.
- The color that follows ""dax"" is consistently ""green"" regardless of the following words.
- ""dax"" appears to be independent of the surrounding words in determining its output since ""dax lug dax wif dax"" results in ""green blue green red green,"" where all instances of ""dax"" result in ""green.""

Given these observations, the rule is consistent that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,3,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the position of ""dax"" in the input and the corresponding output:

2. dax lug wif -> green blue red
3. dax bluf wif lug zup -> green green red blue yellow
4. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
5. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red

From these examples, we can note the following patterns:
- Every time ""dax"" appears, the word ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
- ""dax"" does not depend on its position within the input sequence to be translated to ""green"" in the output.
- The output ""green"" is consistent regardless of the surrounding words.

Now the rule seems clear:

Rule: ""dax"" translates to ""green"" regardless of context.",1.0,3,dax
"From the provided examples, we can induce the following associations:

- Every time the word ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"".
- The word ""lug"" is associated with the output ""blue"".
- The word ""wif"" is associated with the output ""red"".
- The word ""bluf"" appears twice, and in both cases, it's associated with ""green"".
- The word ""zup"" is associated with the output ""yellow"".
- The word ""walm"" is not associated with a unique color but seems to create a repetition of the last color, which is ""red"" in the provided example.

Given these associations, we can summarize the rule for ""dax"" as follows:

- wif is consistently output as red.
- zup is associated with yellow and precedes wif in the second example, suggesting no change when wif follows it.

Walm -> green.",1.0,3,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the color output in relation to the position of ""walm"" among other words.

1. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
2. dax walm wif zup -> green green green red yellow
3. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
4. dax wif walm -> green red red red
5. zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green

Here are some observations:

- Whenever ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the subsequent word is rendered as ""green."" This suggests that ""walm"" may be some sort of duplicator or amplifier for the color associated with ""dax,"" which is green.
- In example 4, ""walm"" is at the end and follows ""wif,"" resulting in ""red red."" This may further support the idea that ""walm"" duplicates the color associated with the word preceding it.
- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the color blue is repeated three times. This again seems to suggest repetition or duplication.
- Finally, example 5, ""zup wif dax walm,"" ends with ""green green green,"" indicative of ""walm"" applying the green color associated with ""dax"" repeatedly.

Given the above analysis, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be a duplication of the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word.",0.8,3,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we examine how the input and output pairs change with its presence. From the examples provided, we can observe the following:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output sequence begins with three ""blue"" followed by the color corresponding to the last word (""green"" for ""dax""). 

2. When ""walm"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif,"" the output is ""green green green red,"" with the color after ""wif"" depending on its following word (""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" gives ""red"").

3. When ""walm"" follows ""dax wif,"" the output is ""green red red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" may trigger a repetition of the color that corresponds to ""wif.""

4. When ""walm"" comes at the end after ""zup wif dax,"" it results in two additional ""green"" at the end of the sequence. 

Based on these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it in all cases, with the number of repetitions perhaps based on the position of ""walm"" in the sequence or the specific words involved. Specifically:

- Following ""lug,"" ""walm"" generates three repetitions.
- Between ""dax"" and ""wif,"" it generates one repetition.
- As the last word after ""dax wif,"" it generates one additional repetition.
- As the last word after ""zup wif dax,"" it generates two repetitions of ""green,"" which corresponds to ""dax.""

From the above logic, we can establish a general rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word. The number of repetitions seems context-dependent, influenced by ""walm's"" position or the words around it.",0.8,3,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the pattern of inputs and outputs in the given examples. We'll assess the positioning of ""walm"" in the input sequences and the corresponding output colors to figure out the rule behind it.

Let's look at the positions of ""walm"" in the input and the color that appears right after it in the output:

1. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
   ""walm"" follows ""lug"", and the output sequence is three ""blue"" followed by ""green"". ""lug"" has no other reference point, so it's difficult to attribute the triple ""blue"" to it directly.
   
2. dax walm wif zup -> green green green red yellow
   ""walm"" follows ""dax"", and the output has three ""green"" followed by ""red"". We see that ""dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green"" in the other examples. 

3. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" as well, and we see the same three ""green"" followed by ""red"".

4. dax wif walm -> green red red red
   ""walm"" is at the end, and it is not immediately obvious what it corresponds to, but ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" appears to correspond to ""red"".

5. zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green
   ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and again we have ""green green green"" following the occurrence of ""dax"".

From these observations, we can surmise a rule:

When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the immediate output is three repetitions of the color corresponding to ""dax"" (which is ""green""), followed by the color that corresponds to the word after ""walm"" if there is one. For example:

- In ""dax walm wif zup"", ""wif"" results in an output of ""red"", so that comes right after the three ""green"" that correspond to ""dax"".
- In ""zup wif dax walm,"" there is no word after ""walm"", so the color after the three repetitions of ""green"" is not influenced by ""walm"", but simply follows the sequence of input colors before ""walm"".

Based on the available information, we can deduce that ""walm"" functions as a sort of repeater for the color corresponding to ""dax"", which is ""green"", but an additional rule appears to be at play since ""dax wif walm"" does not follow that exact rule.

However, with the limited examples and the complexity of the rule variants, we cannot explicitly state what ""walm"" means in the context where there is no word following it, as seen in ""dax wif walm"". Therefore, while we have a partial rule when ""walm"" follows ""dax"", we cannot completely specify a rule across all contexts with the information given.

A tentative rule, with the caveat that there may be additional influencing factors not covered by these examples, is:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" in the input, the output immediately after ""walm"" is three instances of the color corresponding to ""dax"" followed by the color that corresponds to the subsequent word, if there is one.

- The presence of other words such as ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""walm,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup"" correspond to other colors (""red,"" ""red,"" ""green,"" ""blue,"" and ""yellow"" respectively).

Therefore, the meaning assigned to the nonce word ""dax"" in this context is the color ""green.""

Rule:
dax -> green",1.0,5,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine each instance of its use and the corresponding output:

1. When ""dax"" is by itself (Input: dax), the output is simply green.
    - Output: green

2. When ""dax"" is followed by other words, such as ""wif walm"" or ""zup wif,"" it seems that ""dax"" still corresponds to green, and the other words correspond to different colors.
    - Input: ""dax wif walm"" - Output: green red red red
    - Input: ""dax zup wif"" - Output: green yellow red
    This implies that ""dax"" does not change even when combined with other words.

3. When ""dax"" follows other words, it still results in a green output.
    - Input: ""wif bluf dax walm"" - Output: red red green green green
    - Input: ""wif bluf dax lug"" - Output: red red green blue
    Again, it shows that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position.

Given the consistent correlation between ""dax"" and the color green in the output, we can induce the rule that ""dax"" represents the color green.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,5,dax
"Based on the given examples, it seems the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" as every time ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" figures in the output. When ""dax"" is used in combination with other words, additional colors are associated with those other words. Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and in different instances, ""walm"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""red"" and ""blue"" respectively. The word ""zup"" has appeared only once, corresponding to ""yellow"".

The rule for ""dax"" appears straightforward: irrespective of its position in the input sentence, it always translates to ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,5,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" seems to be associated with the color green consistently. Each instance of ""dax"" is translated to ""green"" in the output, irrespective of its position in the input sequence or the other words that accompany it. Here is the observed pattern summarized in a rule:

dax -> green

Rule: The presence of the word ""dax"" in any input sequence corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output sequence.",1.0,5,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax"", let's examine the consistent patterns in the given input-output examples:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

2. Input: wif bluf dax lug
   Output: red red green blue

3. Input: dax
   Output: green

4. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

5. Input: dax zup wif
   Output: green yellow red

Every time the word ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output is green. Other words such as ""wif"", ""bluf"", ""lug"", ""walm"", and ""zup"", are associated with a variety of colors—none of which are consistently green. This indicates that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of the context or position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,5,dax
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".",1.0,5,wif
"wif -> red. Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red in all provided examples.",1.0,5,wif

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the given outputs.",1.0,5,wif
"wif -> meaning. Red.

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,5,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that each nonce word corresponds with a specific color. The word ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red"" regardless of the context it is used in. Here is the observed correlation:

""wif"" -> red

Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""",1.0,5,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word “zup” appears to correspond to the word ""yellow"" in the outputs. The word following ""zup"" determines how many additional ""yellow""s are included before a different color (if any) is appended to the output sequence. Here is the pattern observed:

- “walm” seems to correspond to two additional ""yellow""s.
- “wif” seems to correspond to a ""red"" at the end of the sequence.
- ""bluf"" seems to correspond to one additional ""yellow"".

Thus, the rule induced from the examples would be:

- zup -> yellow
- zup followed by ""walm"" -> two additional yellows (for a total of three yellows)
- zup followed by ""wif"" -> red at the end
- zup followed by ""bluf"" -> one additional yellow (for a total of two yellows)

Rule: When ""zup"" is used alone, it corresponds to a single instance of ""yellow."" When ""zup"" is followed by another word, the number and type of colors in the output depend on the specific word that follows “zup.”",0.9,5,zup
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color output in the pattern, with each word following ""zup"" altering the output pattern by adding another color. Here's the apparent relationship:

- ""zup"" on its own results in a single ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" following ""zup"" adds two additional ""yellow"" outputs.
- ""wif"" following ""zup"" (whether it comes after ""walm"" or not), results in a single ""red"" at the end.
- ""bluf"" following ""zup"" adds only one additional ""yellow,"" one fewer than when ""walm"" follows ""zup.""

Therefore, the rules for ""zup"" followed by another word seem to be:

- ""zup"" equates to ""yellow.""
- ""zup walm"" equates to ""yellow"" plus two additional ""yellows.""
- ""zup wif"" adds a ""red"" to the end of the sequence that started with ""yellow.""
- ""zup bluf"" adds one ""yellow"" less than ""zup walm.""

Rule: ""zup"" -> one yellow output; each subsequent word following ""zup"" alters the output pattern by adding a specific number and/or color of outputs.",0.9,5,zup
"Based on the pattern in the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" indicates the color yellow, with each instance of ""zup"" adding one more yellow to the output. The word following ""zup"" appears to modify the output by adding additional colors. For instance, ""wif"" seems to correspond to the color red, while ""walm"" has no effect on the color output other than repeating yellow. Meanwhile, ""bluf"" results in one less yellow without introducing a new color.

Here is the distilled rule:

zup -> yellow
walm -> repeats the color yellow associated with zup, without changing the sequence or adding a new color
bluf -> reduces the number of yellows by one
wif -> adds red to the sequence

Rule: The word ""zup"" dictates the output of yellow, and the presence of other words modifies the sequence of colors accordingly.",0.9,5,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" seems to correspond to the word ""yellow."" Each instance of the word ""walm"" also corresponds to the word ""yellow,"" and the word ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red."" There is no clear meaning for the word ""bluf"" from a single occurrence, but we can infer that it does not correspond to any color in the examples since it only appears once and the corresponding output is one ""yellow"" less than the input which contains ""zup"" alone.

Rule:
- ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow""
- ""walm"" corresponds to the output ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red""
- ""bluf"" is an unknown but it does not independently correspond to an output color based on the given examples.",0.9,5,zup
"Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be as follows:

- Each instance of ""zup"" before another word corresponds to a single ""yellow.""
- The word ""walm"" corresponds to two ""yellow.""
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- The word ""bluf"" seems to be absent from the output, suggesting that it either corresponds to nothing or the presence of ""zup"" alters its representation.

Thus, the rule could be stated as:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it also corresponds to ""yellow"" two times.
- When ""wif"" follows ""zup,"" it corresponds to ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" there's no clear rule from the one example, but it may correspond to nothing.

"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be:

bluf -> red.",0.0,5,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color of the immediately preceding word in the sequence. Here's the deduction:

- In the first example, ""lug"" is translated as ""blue,"" and when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue"" again.
- In the second example, ""dax"" is translated as ""green,"" and when ""walm"" follows, the output is ""green"" again.
- Similarly, in the subsequent examples, whatever color ""walm"" follows, it repeats that same color.

Thus, we can surmise:

Walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, it takes on the color corresponding to that word repeatably.",1.0,5,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to induce repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Here's the rationale:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue,"" meaning ""walm"" causes ""lug"" (blue) to be repeated.
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" becomes ""green green green,"" so ""walm"" causes ""dax"" (green) to be repeated twice.
- For the third example, ""lug walm zup"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow,"" again showing that ""walm"" causes ""lug"" (blue) to be repeated twice.
- In the fourth example, repeating the pattern emerges where ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" becomes ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow,"" with ""walm"" causing the preceding color word (""wif"" for red) to be repeated twice and again once after ""walm"" before continuing the sequence.
- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" suggesting ""walm"" repeats the preceding color word ""wif"" (red) twice.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the color word immediately before it to be repeated twice.

Rule: walm -> Causes the preceding color word to be repeated twice.",1.0,5,walm
"walm -> repeat previous color

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" appears in the sequence, it indicates that the output should repeat the color of the word immediately before it.",1.0,5,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze its occurrences and compare the output in each instance:

1. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

3. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red

4. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

5. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red

In the first example, the word ""walm"" occurs after ""lug,"" and the corresponding color changes from ""blue"" to ""blue blue."" In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" with the output being ""green green green."" Across all examples, we observe that when ""walm"" follows another word, the output is the corresponding color to the preceding word, repeated as many times as ""walm"" is present after the word.

Based on these inputs and outputs, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word as many times as ""walm"" is used in a sequence.

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each provided context.",1.0,6,zup
"Based on the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" results in the output repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Here are the associations observed from the examples:
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow""
- ""wif"" is associated with ""red""
- ""dax"" is associated with ""green""

In each instance where ""bluf"" is used, the color word that comes out in the output is a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. For example, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"" and ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"". This also holds true when multiple words precede and follow ""bluf"", as shown in the example ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" which results in ""green green red yellow green"". Here, ""green"" is repeated because it is the color associated with ""dax"" that comes before ""bluf"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word. Rule: When bluf is used, output the color corresponding to the word before it, twice.",1.0,6,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""repeat the color associated with the previous word.""

Examples:

- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" because the color associated with ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" means to repeat that color.
- ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" translates to ""green green red yellow green"" because the color associated with ""dax"" is green and ""bluf"" repeats it; ""wif"" is associated with red; ""zup"" is associated with yellow; and ""dax"" is repeated at the end.",1.0,6,bluf
"bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word. Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a word, the output is the color associated with that word repeated twice.",1.0,6,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be a rule that dictates the output should be a repeated color based on the word that immediately precedes ""bluf."" Here's the pattern from the examples given:

- ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow""
- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red""
- ""zup bluf"" (repeated input) gives the same repeated output: ""yellow yellow""
- ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" results in ""green green red yellow green"", where ""dax bluf"" turns into ""green green"" and ""wif"" and ""zup"" retain their respective colors ""red"" and ""yellow"" (with ""green"" at the end for the last ""dax"").
- ""wif bluf"" (repeated input) results again in ""red red""

From these examples, we can surmise that bluf tells us to duplicate the color corresponding to the word before it. Therefore:

Rule: bluf -> duplicate the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,6,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" repeats the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. 

Here's the evidence to support that rule:

- When ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow"", with ""yellow"" being repeated.
- When ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"", the output is ""red red"", with ""red"" being repeated.
- In a longer sequence, ""dax bluf wif zup dax"", we can see the repetition pattern persists for the word right before ""bluf"" (i.e., ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and thus the output repeats ""green"" after ""bluf""). 

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

bluf -> Repeats the color associated with the word directly preceding it.

Rule: When following a color-denoting word, ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color corresponding to the preceding word.",1.0,6,bluf
"Analyzing the examples provided, we can create a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

1. In every output, the word ""walm"" corresponds to green except for the number of greens, which vary according to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.
2. When ""walm"" is the second word, as in ""dax walm,"" there are three green outputs.
3. When ""walm"" is preceded by one or more non-""dax"" words, there is only one green output followed by reds or other colors corresponding to those words if ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" (red), or blues if ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence after ""lug"" (blue).
4. ""dax"" seems to be associated with green every time it appears in the input, while ""walm"" adds a varying number of additional greens depending on its position and what precedes it.

From this, we can induce that ""walm"" relates to the color green, but the exact number of greens it generates in the output seems to be influenced by its position relative to other words, particularly ""dax"" and their meaning in terms of color.

Based on the examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Generates an output of ""green,"" with the number of greens dependent on its position and the words that come before it. Specifically, if ""walm"" directly follows ""dax,"" it results in a sequence of three greens. If ""walm"" is preceded by any other words, it results in one green. The colors that follow the green(s) depend on the words coming after ""walm."" If there is a ""wif"" after ""walm,"" it will be red, and if there is ""lug,"" it will be blue. If ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, it ends with green followed by other colors corresponding to the preceding words or a single blue if followed by ""lug"".",0.9,6,walm
"In the given examples, the word ""walm"" impacts the sequence of the colors in the output.

Assuming that ""dax"" always translates to ""green"", then looking at the outputs when ""walm"" is present:

1. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
2. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
5. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

By examining these sequences, we can see that ""walm"" causes the color that would correspond to the immediately following word (""wif"", ""zup"", ""lug"", etc.) to be repeated three times. The rule seems to be that ""walm"" makes the output color of the next word to be repeated thrice regardless of what the color would normally be.

Let's consider each case:

- In the first example, ""wif"" would normally correspond to ""red"", and it's repeated three times after ""walm"".
- In the second example, right after ""walm"", the word ""zup"" which normally corresponds to yellow is seen three times, followed by ""lug"" which corresponds to blue, and when ""dax"" is repeated at the end, it is shown once as green.
- In the third example, there is no word following ""walm"", hence no color repetition is observed.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" appears at the end and ""lug”, which precedes it and usually corresponds to blue, is repeated three times.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" would correspond to red, and after ""walm"", red is repeated three times.

Based on the above observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> the following word's color is repeated three times. If there is no word following ""walm"", there is no repetition and it appears as though ""walm"" has no output of its own.",0.9,6,walm
"Observing the examples given, it seems that the presence of the word ""walm"" activates a pattern of repeating the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it. The color repeats for as many times as the number of syllables in the word ""dax"" before ""walm."" If there is no ""dax"" before ""walm"", then ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color for as many syllables as are in the word directly preceding ""walm.""

Let's examine the examples:

1. Input: dax walm wif Output: green green green red
   - ""dax"" seems to correspond to green, and following ""walm,"" green is repeated three times.
   
2. Input: dax walm zup lug dax Output: green green green yellow blue green
   - Again, ""dax"" corresponds to green, repeated thrice after ""walm,"" and then ""zup"" and ""lug"" proceed normally until another ""dax"" which is green.
   
3. Input: dax walm Output: green green green
   - Just like the first example, ""walm"" causes ""dax"" (green) to repeat thrice.
   
4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   - Here ""walm"" is following ""lug"" (blue), which is repeated thrice indicating that ""walm"" triggers repetition not only after ""dax"" but any word preceding it.
   
5. Input: dax wif walm Output: green red red red
   - Here ""dax"" is green, ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" causes ""wif"" to be repeated thrice (red repeated three times).

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color specified by the word right before it as many times as syllables in ""dax"" are in the sequence before ""walm."" If ""dax"" is not present before ""walm,"" it repeats for as many syllables as are in the word directly preceding ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color of the preceding word by the count of syllables in ""dax"" if present before ""walm"" in the sequence. If ""dax"" is not present, it causes repetition equal to the number of syllables in the word immediately preceding ""walm.""",0.9,6,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the consistencies in each example:

1. dax walm wif -> green green green red
2. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green
3. dax walm -> green green green
4. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
5. dax wif walm -> green red red red

From the above examples, we can identify the following patterns:

- Every time ""walm"" appears, the color green is in the output immediately before a change in color.
- In examples 1, 3, and 5, the word ""walm"" is followed directly by a color change in the output.
- In example 4, the word ""walm"" comes at the end, and the last three outputs are the color blue.

Combining these observations, it seems that ""walm"" acts as a turning point indicator in a sequence— causing a change in the patterns (like the signal for the next word to change the color that has been consistent so far).

Rule: walm -> indicated that the following word, if any, will change the output color or it maintains the new color if it's the last in the sequence.",0.8,6,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm"", let's analyze each example and the output associated with it. We need to find a pattern for the use of ""walm"" and how it affects the output.

First, let's see if the position of ""walm"" is related to the output color sequence:

1. dax walm wif -> green green green red
2. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green
3. dax walm -> green green green
4. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
5. dax wif walm -> green red red red

In examples 1, 3, and 5 ""walm"" comes immediately after ""dax"", and the color sequence starts with ""green green green"". This may suggest that ""dax walm"" correlates to ""green green green"".

In example 2, ""dax walm"" is followed by different words and the color pattern does not repeat, so ""walm"" may not affect the words that follow it directly.

In example 4, ""walm"" is the last word, and the pattern for the colors preceding it does not follow a ""green green green"" sequence. In this case, only the last color is ""blue"", much like the last word is ""walm"".

From these observations, a possible rule is that ""walm"" makes the color of the word immediately before it repeat three times. More specifically, the word ""walm"" when used after another word makes that word's associated color repeat three times if the prior word is ""dax"". If the word preceding ""walm"" does not have an associated color, the default color is ""red"", as shown in examples 1 and 5 where ""wif"" changes to ""red"" when following ""walm"". 

Example 4, with ""walm"" at the end, does not seem to fit the pattern exactly, but by applying the rule that ""walm"" may repeat the preceding color three times, we can say that ""lug"" has a color ""blue"", and thus ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times. 

With the evidence provided, ""walm"" seems to invoke repetition in the preceding word's color, but the degree to which this rule applies is not wholly consistent across the examples, particularly for the last example. Nonetheless, the closest rule that can be induced is:

Rule: walm -> repeats the associated output color of the preceding word three times. If the preceding word is ""dax"", the color is ""green""; if the preceding word does not have an associated color, the color is ""red"".",0.7,6,walm

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. Given the consistent mapping of words to colors across the different examples, we can deduce the meaning of ""wif"" as follows:

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word 'wif', we can compare the inputs and the corresponding outputs. By aligning each input with its output, we can try to deduce the pattern for ‘wif’ and other words.

From the given examples:

1. Input: wif dax lug dax -> Output: red green blue green
2. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf -> Output: blue red red green blue blue
3. Input: wif -> Output: red
4. Input: lug dax lug wif -> Output: blue green blue red
5. Input: wif dax lug -> Output: red green blue

Looking at example 3, when the input is only 'wif', the output is 'red'. This strongly suggests that 'wif' corresponds to 'red'. To verify this, we can look at the other examples where 'wif' appears:

- In example 1, 'wif' is the first word in the input and 'red' is the first color in the output.
- In example 2, 'wif' is the second word and 'red' is the second color.
- In example 4, 'wif' is the last word and 'red' is the last color in their sequences.
- In example 5, 'wif' is the first word again, and correspondingly, 'red' is the first color in the output.

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the outputs. Here is the evidence supporting this conclusion:

- In every example where ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- The position of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to the position of ""yellow"" in the output.
- There are instances where ""zup"" is the only word in the input that has a corresponding ""yellow"" in the output, ruling out dependence on context or surrounding words.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,7,zup
"Based on the given examples, each instance of the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. There is a one-to-one relationship between the appearance of ""zup"" and the word ""yellow,"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples.",1.0,7,zup
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Here's how we map the inputs to the outputs:

- Everywhere ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence.
- ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""
- The word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" corresponds with repeat occurrences of ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rules for the nonce word ""zup"" can be outlined as follows:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,7,zup
"Based on the provided inputs and outputs, it appears the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" The outputs consistently show the word ""blue"" in the position where ""bluf"" appears in the inputs.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the meaning of ""bluf"" is ""blue."" When ""bluf"" follows any word other than ""lug,"" the meaning of ""bluf"" is ""green.""",1.0,7,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> blue

"Based on the examples provided, we can infer that the nonce word ""walm"" refers to a repetition of the color word that directly precedes it in the series. To determine the specific number of repetitions, we observe the output for the number of times the previous color word is repeated after ""walm"" is introduced.

Here's the analysis:

1. In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" which indicates that ""lug"" (blue) is repeated three times.

2. In the second example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" indicating that ""dax"" (green) is also repeated three times.

3. In the third example, ""lug walm"" again results in ""blue blue blue,"" supporting the rule that ""walm"" causes a thrice repetition of the preceding color.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup walm wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow red red red,"" demonstrating that ""walm"" repeats ""zup"" (yellow) three times and then, when it appears again after ""wif,"" it repeats ""wif"" (red) three times.

5. In the fifth example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" results in a sequence where ""walm"" follows after ""wif"" and the sequence ""red red red"" appears, again showing a thrice repetition of the preceding color word ""wif"" (red).

Therefore, we conclude that:

walm -> When walm appears after a color word, it causes that color word to be repeated three more times.

Rule: If X represents a color word (e.g., lug is blue, wif is red), then ""X walm"" translates to ""X X X X"" in the output.",1.0,7,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to represent the repetition of the previous color word three times. We can see this pattern when the word ""walm"" is used in the various input sequences, where it's followed by a tripling of the color word that came immediately before it. 

To illustrate:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" which is the color blue repeated three times, as ""lug"" stands for blue.
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" which is the color green repeated three times, with ""dax"" representing green.
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red red red"", which is yellow tripling for ""zup"" and red tripling for ""wif.""

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the previous color word three times.",1.0,7,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the pattern where ""walm"" appears and the corresponding output:

1. ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red red""
2. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
3. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue""
4. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" -> ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red""
5. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" -> ""red red green green red red red blue red""

Based on these examples, it seems like ""walm"" causes the following output to be a repetition of the previous color, repeating as many times as the number of letters in the previous word. Here's how it seems to work for each example:

1. ""lug"" (3 letters) -> ""blue blue blue"", followed by ""walm"" -> ""blue"" (repeating ""blue"" three times)
2. ""dax"" (3 letters) -> ""green green green"", with ""walm"" following ""dax""
3. ""lug"" (3 letters) -> ""blue blue blue"", again with ""walm"" repeating the previous color three times
4. ""zup"" (3 letters) -> ""yellow yellow yellow"", followed by ""walm"", and then ""wif"" (3 letters) -> ""red red red"" after the second ""walm""
5. ""wif"" (3 letters) -> ""red red red"", ""lug"" -> ""blue"", and then ""walm"" following ""wif"" but interrupted by ""lug"", with ""wif"" following ""walm"" resulting in another ""red""

So, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be repeated a number of times equal to the number of letters in the word before ""walm"".

Therefore:
walm -> meaning: Repeat the previous color name a number of times corresponding to the number of letters in the word immediately preceding ""walm"".",1.0,7,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in each example.

1. Input: lug walm wif bluf | Output: blue blue blue red red
2. Input: wif bluf dax walm | Output: red red green green green
3. Input: wif lug walm | Output: red blue blue blue
4. Input: dax zup walm wif walm | Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
5. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif | Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Looking at the output for each occurrence of ""walm"" in the inputs, we can notice that:

- After ""lug walm,"" we have three blues.
- After ""dax walm,"" we have three greens.
- After ""wif lug walm,"" there's an additional blue, making it three blues.
- After ""dax zup walm,"" we have three yellows.
- The second ""walm"" in example 4 is followed by three reds because it's directly preceded by ""wif.""
- In example 5, ""wif walm"" is followed by three reds and is preceded by ""lug wif,"" which is then followed by a solitary red for the last ""wif.""

From this, we can induce that ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the word preceding it three times. If it's followed by another regular word, the color for that word is outputted after the three repeats.

Hence:

walm -> meaning. The meaning is that the color of the word immediately before ""walm"" is repeated three times.

Rule: If the input contains the word ""walm"" after another word (let's call this word X), the color associated with word X should be outputted three times in a row. If there is a word Y after ""walm,"" then the color associated with word Y should be outputted after the three repeats.",0.9,7,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let’s look at the patterns for each instance of ""walm"" and its corresponding outputs:

1. Input: lug walm wif bluf | Output: blue blue blue red red
2. Input: wif bluf dax walm | Output: red red green green green
3. Input: wif lug walm | Output: red blue blue blue
4. Input: dax zup walm wif walm | Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
5. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif | Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Let’s analyze the first input-output pair:
- After ""lug"" comes three blues, and after ""walm"" comes two reds.

Second input-output pair:
- After ""dax"" comes three greens, and after ""walm"" comes three greens again.

Observing the above, we notice ""walm"" seems to produce a series of colors that repeats the color of the word that precedes it.

Third input-output pair:
- After ""lug"" comes three blues, and after ""walm"" comes three blues again.

Fourth input-output pair:
- After ""zup"" comes three yellows, and after ""walm"" comes two reds.
- Importantly, the sequence before the final ""walm"" is wif, which corresponds to red, and two reds follow ""walm.""

Fifth input-output pair:
- After ""wif"" comes red, then multiple sequences, but immediately following the final ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, and then red follows after ""lug.""

From these observations, it seems ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the previous word a number of times before moving on to the next color associated with the following word. There is also a pattern where the number of repetitions might be decreasing by one each time ""walm"" appears in a sequence.

Based on these examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> When ""walm"" appears in a sequence, it repeats the color of the preceding word. The number of repetitions decreases by one each time ""walm"" is used in a series.

Let us apply the rule to confirm with one more look at the inputs and outputs.

Considering the fourth input-output pair, the first appearance of ""walm"" corresponds to three yellows (the color for ""zup""), followed by one ""wif"" (red), resulting in three reds, which aligns with our deductions (reduced by one for the second occurrence of ""walm"").",0.9,7,walm

Rule: wif -> ""red"".",1.0,8,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce a pattern that associates each nonce word with a corresponding color. To find the meaning of ""wif,"" we can observe the consistent output across different inputs:

- In the second example, ""wif"" is directly followed by ""red"" with no preceding context from ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red,"" preceded by ""lug"" (blue) and followed by ""lug"" (blue) again, which shows the consistency.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" when it precedes ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red,"" both when it precedes and follows ""dax"" (green).

In each case, ""wif"" is directly followed by the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of context. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

- zup wif -> yellow red

2. If ""bluf"" is not preceded by ""lug,"" then the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""",1.0,8,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the provided examples and find a pattern.

In the first example:

- Input: lug wif bluf
- Output: blue red red

Here, we can tell that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" because it's in the second position in the input and the same goes for the output. ""Wif"" translates to ""red"" for similar reasoning.

In the second example:

- Input: zup bluf lug zup
- Output: yellow yellow blue yellow

""Zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and from the previous example, we determined that ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" 

Notice that when ""bluf"" is added after ""zup"" in the first position, the output is ""yellow yellow."" The same pattern is present whenever ""bluf"" appears. 

In the third example:

- Input: zup bluf
- Output: yellow yellow

Once again, when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" we get a double ""yellow"" in the output.

In the fourth example:

- Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
- Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red

Taking what we've learned, we can see that each time ""bluf"" appears, we repeat the color word directly before it.

Finally, in the fifth example:

- Input: wif bluf lug zup
- Output: red red blue yellow

Here too, ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that comes directly before.

Rule:
bluf -> Repeat the color word directly before ""bluf"".",1.0,8,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> blue when directly following lug, otherwise duplicate the color of the word immediately preceding bluf.",1.0,8,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be as follows:

- Whenever the word ""bluf"" is encountered, the output is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".

Let's apply this rule to the given examples to show how it works:

Example 1:
Input: lug wif bluf
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue, then ""wif"" corresponds to red. Since ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which corresponds to red, the output after ""wif"" is ""red red"".

Example 2:
Input: zup bluf lug zup
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. Since ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output after ""zup"" is ""yellow yellow"". ""lug"" corresponds to blue and is followed by another ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow.

Example 3:
Input: zup bluf
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and is immediately followed by ""bluf"", hence ""bluf"" results in another ""yellow"".

Example 4:
Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow followed by ""lug"" which corresponds to blue. Since ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue blue"". Then there is another ""zup"" corresponding to yellow followed by ""bluf"" which results in another yellow. Finally, ""wif"" corresponds to red.

Example 5:
Input: wif bluf lug zup
- ""wif"" corresponds to red and is directly followed by ""bluf"", which results in another ""red"". ""lug"" corresponds to blue followed by ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow.

From the above, the rule can be deduced as:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. When ""bluf"" is used in the sequence, the color that is outputted is the same color that corresponds to the word immediately before ""bluf"". 

So if the word before ""bluf"" translates to X color, then ""bluf"" results in the output of X color repeated once.",1.0,8,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I'll look at each instance of its use and the corresponding outputs:

1. ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red""
2. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
3. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""
4. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" -> ""green blue blue blue yellow red""
5. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""

Analyzing the patterns, we can see that every time ""walm"" is used:

- The color output preceding it is repeated for as many additional words follow ""walm,"" up to the next occurrence of ""walm"" (if any) or the end of the input.
- When ""walm"" is the second word, it repeats the color corresponding to the first word thrice as seen in example 2.
- Once a new word appears after repetitions caused by ""walm,"" the sequence resets with the new word's associated color, as seen in examples 3 and 4.

Based on this, it appears that ""walm"" indicates a repetition rule to repeat the previous color output for the subsequent words until a different rule is applied or the input sequence ends.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word for the subsequent words until a new instruction is encountered or the end of the sequence is reached.",0.9,8,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Let's compare each input sequence with its output side by side:

1. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   - Here, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and is followed by ""green.""
   - ""Wif"" follows ""walm"" and is followed by ""red.""

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""Zup"" precedes ""walm"" and is followed by ""yellow.""

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - ""Wif"" precedes ""walm,"" followed by ""red.""
   - ""Dax"" and ""zup"" follow ""walm"" and are followed by ""green"" and ""yellow,"" respectively.

4. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""Dax"" precedes ""walm,"" followed by ""green.""
   - ""Lug"" does not seem to affect the color output before ""walm.""
   - ""Zup"" and ""wif"" follow ""walm"" and are associated with ""yellow"" and ""red.""

5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   - ""Zup"" recurs several times and precedes ""walm,"" followed exclusively by ""yellow.""
   - ""Dax"" and ""wif"" follow ""walm"" and correspond to ""green"" and ""red.""
   - ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" and translates to ""red"" in this context, not affecting ""walm.""

From the patterns, we can see that ""walm"" itself does not have a single corresponding color, but the color that follows ""walm"" seems to be determined by the word that immediately follows it. Specifically:

- When ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" ""green"" is the output.
- When ""zup"" follows ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is the output.
- When ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" ""red"" is the output.
- ""Walm"" itself doesn't correspond with ""blue""; this is a result of ""lug.""

Given these observations, it seems that ""walm"" functions as a sort of modifier that depends on the next word to define its output. Therefore, we can establish the rule that:

Rule: The word that immediately follows ""walm"" determines the color output associated with ""walm."" If ""dax"" follows, the output is ""green."" If ""zup"" follows, the output is ""yellow."" If ""wif"" follows, the output is ""red.""",0.9,8,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at patterns in the input and output pairs. Analyzing the given examples listed:

1. dax walm wif -> green green green red
2. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
3. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
4. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
5. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Let's examine the contexts in which ""walm"" is used and what follows or precedes it:

- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" in example 1 and precedes a color change from green to red.
- ""walm"" stands alone after ""zup"" in example 2, and no change in color is observed after its presumed position; the output is all yellow.
- ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes a color change from red to green in example 3.
- ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the color changes from blue to yellow in example 4.
- In example 5, ""walm"" is surrounded by ""zup"" and ""dax,"" and a color change is observed from yellow to green and then to red.

The outputs suggest that ""walm"" may be associated with the change in the sequence or transition of colors in the output. It appears right before a color change in most cases. When ""walm"" is immediately preceded by ""lug,"" the color change is from blue to yellow. Otherwise, the color change is from whatever comes before ""walm"" to green.

Thus, based on the provided examples, we can induce the following:

""walm"" seems to be a trigger for changing the color in the sequence. When ""walm"" is used after ""dax"" or ""wif,"" it changes the subsequent color to green. When ""walm"" follows a lone ""zup,"" it continues the same color yellow.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be related to changing a color in a sequence, typically to green if not following ""lug,"" and maintaining the color yellow if it follows ""zup"" without any other inputs influencing it.

Rule: walm -> triggers a change in the sequence of colors to green, unless it follows ""lug,"" which triggers a change to yellow, or follows a lone ""zup,"" which maintains the color as yellow.",0.8,8,walm
"To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the colors that follow each occurrence of ""walm"" in the output:

1. ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red,"" which means ""walm"" is followed by a green and then a color that was not in the input (red). 
2. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which indicates ""walm"" is followed only by yellow colors.
3. ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow,"" suggesting ""walm"" is followed by green and then yellow.
4. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" translates to ""green blue blue blue yellow red,"" showing ""walm"" followed by yellow and red.
5. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red,"" with ""walm"" followed by green and red.

From these cases, ""walm"" seems to cause the following colors to shift down by one position in the sequence. If it seems that each word in the input corresponds to a distinct color in the output (e.g., ""dax"" -> green, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""wif"" -> red), then ""walm"" seems to repeat the color before it, followed by subsequent colors from the input words (if any), shifted one position down.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color of the word before ""walm,"" then continue with the sequence of colors corresponding to the subsequent words, each one position down from where it would normally appear. If there are none left, repeat the last available color.",0.8,8,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to find commonalities across the different inputs and their respective outputs. Let's analyze each given example:

1. Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red
2. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
3. Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
4. Input: dax lug walm zup wif -> Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Now let us find patterns in these examples:

- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""wif"" follows ""walm""; the corresponding output colors for what follows ""walm"" are the same as the colors for ""walm.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and no word follows ""walm."" Again, the output color for ""walm"" matches the color given to the preceding word.
- In example 3, both ""dax"" and ""zup"" follow ""walm,"" and their output colors are green and yellow respectively, which match the colors for ""dax"" and ""zup"" in the other examples.
- In example 4, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup wif"" and the colors for those are yellow and red respectively, which remain consistent with the respective colors for ""zup"" and ""wif"" in other cases.
- In example 5, ""dax wif"" follows ""walm,"" and again, their corresponding colors are green and red, as seen consistently in other examples.

From analyzing the patterns, it seems that ""walm"" causes the following word(s) to repeat the color output of the preceding word (or sequence of words), effectively extending the sequence. When ""walm"" is present, the output color for the words following ""walm"" is a repetition of the output color for the word(s) before ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> causes the following word(s) to repeat the color output of the word(s) preceding ""walm"".",0.8,8,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output sequence. Each instance of the word ""lug"" in the input results in the word ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position or combination with other words.",1.0,9,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,9,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to a repeated output of the word ""blue"". In every example, the appearance of ""lug"" results in the word ""blue"" being produced in the Output once, with the exception of the phrase ""lug walm"", which consistently results in the output ""blue blue blue"". Thus, it appears that ""lug"" means to output ""blue"" and ""walm"" specifically indicates a repetition of ""blue"" three times.

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue.""",1.0,9,lug
"Based on the observed examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" in each input sequence corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output sequence. Therefore:

"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the output, regardless of its position in the input.",1.0,9,dax
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green"". This pattern holds true regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input string or the other words present.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,9,dax
"dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" correlates with the color green in the output.",1.0,9,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Thus, we can infer that ""dax"" directly translates to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,9,dax
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,9,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the word ""wif"" is consistent across different contexts. It always corresponds to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position within the sequence of words. Therefore, it can be concluded:

"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". This can be observed in each instance where ""wif"" is used, regardless of the position of the word in the input sequence or the surrounding words. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" is straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,9,wif
"From the given examples, it is observable that whenever the nonce word ""wif"" appears, the output is consistently ""red."" 

Therefore, we can deduce the rule as follows:

"Observing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can notice that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input or the presence of other words around it.

Thus, the rule is:

zup -> yellow. Meaning: ""zup"" consistently means ""yellow"".",1.0,9,zup
"Based on the examples provided:

- Every instance of the word ""zup"" always results in the word ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words.

- The word ""zup"" does not seem to affect the output of the other words; its presence does not change the color associated with ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" or ""walm."" Each of these words has a consistent color output regardless of whether ""zup"" precedes or follows them.

zup -> yellow. Meaning: ""zup"" means ""yellow.""

Rule: When ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow"" for each occurrence of ""zup.""",1.0,9,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow"". There is no variation in the output when ""zup"" is presented, regardless of whether it appears alone or within a sequence of other nonce words.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow

Meaning: ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.",1.0,9,zup
"Based on the inputs and outputs provided, we see that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the presence of other words. Additionally, we can note that when ""zup"" is combined with ""walm,"" the output is a repetition of the color ""yellow"" for each instance of the combined words. 

When ""zup"" and ""walm"" are used together (as in ""zup walm"" or ""zup dax walm""), the number of ""yellow"" outputs is equal to the number of occurrences of both ""zup"" and ""walm."" ""Dax,"" when provided by itself, seems to correspond to ""green,"" but when combined with ""walm,"" it seems to also create a repeated ""green"" output for the number of occurrences of ""dax"" and ""walm"" combined. 

The consistent rule that can be derived from the examples given is:

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" When ""zup"" appears with the word ""walm,"" the output is a repetition of ""yellow"" for each occurrence of ""zup"" and ""walm."" The output does not change due to the order of words or the presence of other colors/words.

Therefore:

zup -> yellow",1.0,9,zup
"bluf -> repeat the color word that represents the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: When the nonce word bluf is used after another word, the output is the color associated with the preceding word repeated. For example, if the word before bluf is ""wif,"" which is associated with the color red, then bluf means ""red red.""",1.0,9,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to repeat the color designated by the word immediately preceding it. Here's the breakdown:

1. In the sequence ""wif lug bluf,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" Following the rule, ""bluf"" repeats ""blue,"" resulting in ""red blue blue.""

2. In the sequence ""wif lug zup bluf,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" Following the rule, ""bluf"" repeats the color designated by ""zup,"" resulting in ""red blue yellow yellow.""

3. In the sequence ""dax wif bluf,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green."" Following the rule, ""bluf"" repeats the color designated by ""wif,"" resulting in ""green red red.""

4. In the sequence ""lug wif bluf,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red."" Following the rule, ""bluf"" repeats the color designated by ""wif,"" resulting in ""blue red red.""

5. In the sequence ""dax bluf wif zup lug,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" Following the rule, ""bluf"" after ""dax"" repeats the color ""green,"" and the sequence resolves to ""green green red yellow blue.""

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,9,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that precedes it.

For example:

- In ""wif lug bluf"", ""lug"" is associated with blue, so the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue blue"".
- In ""dax wif bluf"", ""wif"" is associated with red, so the output for ""bluf"" is ""red red"".
- In ""dax bluf wif zup lug"", ""dax"" is associated with green, so the output for ""bluf"" is ""green green"".

Therefore, 

bluf -> The color of the preceding word is repeated.",1.0,9,bluf
Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word before bluf.,1.0,9,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following patterns:

- The word ""wif"" consistently leads to the color ""red.""
- The word ""lug"" consistently leads to the color ""blue.""
- The word ""zup"" consistently leads to the color ""yellow.""
- The word ""dax"" consistently leads to the color ""green.""

When ""bluf"" appears in the input, it seems to cause the following word's associated color to be repeated once in the output. Whenever ""bluf"" occurs, it repeats the color associated with the next word. For example:

- ""wif lug **bluf**"" results in ""red blue **blue**.""
- ""wif lug zup **bluf**"" results in ""red blue yellow **yellow**.""
- ""dax wif **bluf**"" results in ""green red **red**.""
- ""lug wif **bluf**"" results in ""blue red **red**.""
- ""dax **bluf** wif zup lug"" results in ""green **green** red yellow blue,"" where ""bluf"" is causing ""green"" to be doubled.

This leads to the general rule that ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the next color-word in the series to be doubled in the output. So the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> ""Repeat the color associated with the following word.""",1.0,9,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the correlation between the input and the output of each example:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   Analysis: The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" to ""blue,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Since ""walm"" is followed by three ""blue,"" it might suggest that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the last color mentioned. 

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Analysis: Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and since ""walm"" follows it, the output is three times ""green."" This supports the idea of repetition.

3. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   Analysis: ""dax"" is ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" we have two ""green"" and one new color, which corresponds to ""zup"" (yellow), followed by ""lug"" (blue). It confirms that ""walm"" initiates a repetition but does not affect words that follow it.

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Analysis: ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and following ""walm,"" there are three ""red."" This is consistent with the repetition pattern deduced earlier.

5. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   Analysis: Following the same logic, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""walm"" results in three ""green"" followed by the color corresponding to ""lug"" which is ""blue.""

From these examples, we can deduce that:
Rule: ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the directly preceding word to be repeated three times in the output.

Therefore:
walm -> rule: causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times.",1.0,9,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color assigned to the word that precedes it. The repetitions are threefold, based on the given outputs. Here are the deductions:

- ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" results in ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to a single ""blue."" ""Walm"" results in three ""blue.""
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" creates three ""green.""
- ""dax walm zup lug"" results in ""green green green yellow blue."" In this case, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" so ""walm"" again creates three ""green.""
- ""zup wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red."" Here ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" and it repeats the ""red"" three times.
- ""zup wif dax walm lug"" results in ""yellow red green green green blue."" In this sequence, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" resulting in three ""green.""

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",1.0,9,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should compare the outputs of the examples where ""walm"" is present:

1. lug walm -> blue blue blue
2. dax walm -> green green green
3. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue
4. wif walm -> red red red
5. zup wif dax walm lug -> yellow red green green green blue

Analyzing these, we notice that ""walm"" produces a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes directly before it. For example, when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Rule:
walm -> repetition of the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,9,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the pattern of outputs relative to the inputs presented in the examples.

The following observations can be made:
- Each input word correlates with a specific color in the output.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""
- When ""walm"" is present in the input, the output color sequence includes multiple instances of the same color that directly precedes ""walm.""

Looking at the examples:
- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which outputs ""blue""), and the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which outputs ""green""), and the output is ""green green green.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" also follows ""dax,"" and the output again has three ""green"" in a row.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which outputs ""red""), and the output is ""red red red.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green green.""

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that directly precedes it three times in the output.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the previous word to be repeated three times in the output sequence.",1.0,9,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at how its presence affects the output colors.

We'll start by examining each input and corresponding output:

1. Input: **wif zup bluf lug walm**
   Output: **red yellow yellow blue blue blue**
   
   Here, 'wif' corresponds to 'red', 'zup' to 'yellow', 'bluf' to 'blue', and 'lug' also to 'blue'. 'Walm' follows 'lug' and produces two additional 'blue' outputs.

2. Input: **dax walm**
   Output: **green green green**
   
   'Dax' corresponds to 'green', and after 'walm', there are two additional 'green' outputs.

3. Input: **dax walm zup lug**
   Output: **green green green yellow blue**
   
   Again, 'dax' produces 'green', and after 'walm', there's an expansion of the 'green' before proceeding with 'zup' and 'lug', which correspond to 'yellow' and 'blue', respectively.

4. Input: **zup wif walm**
   Output: **yellow red red red**
   
   Here, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', and 'wif' to 'red'. The occurrence of 'walm' here also results in an expansion of 'red'.

5. Input: **zup wif dax walm lug**
   Output: **yellow red green green green blue**
   
   Each word seems to have its corresponding color, but after 'walm', the color of 'dax' ('green') is expanded before moving to 'lug', which has its own, different color ('blue').

From these examples, it appears that 'walm' causes the following effect: it repeats the color output of the word preceding it multiple times. The number of repetitions seems to be equal to the number of occurrences of that color in the sequence prior to 'walm'.

Rule: Walm -> Repeats the previous color's output by the number of times the color has appeared before.

- In example 1, 'lug' is 'blue' and 'blue' has appeared once before 'walm', so 'walm' repeats 'blue' twice (for a total of three 'blue' in a row).
- In example 2, 'dax' is 'green' and it has not appeared before 'walm', so 'walm' repeats 'green' twice.
- In example 3, 'dax' is 'green' and it has not appeared before 'walm', so 'walm' repeats 'green' twice.
- In example 4, 'wif' is 'red' and it has not appeared before 'walm', so 'walm' repeats 'red' twice. 
- In example 5, 'dax' is 'green' and it has not appeared before 'walm', so 'walm' repeats 'green' twice. 

The common pattern is that when 'walm' follows a color word, the color is repeated by the number of times it has shown up in the sequence already, plus one additional time (for the original occurrence).",1.0,9,walm

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that there is a system for translating individual words into colors. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" This can be established as a rule since ""dax"" yields ""green"" in every instance provided.

The other words seem to correspond to specific colors as well. For example, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" to ""blue."" ""Wif"" appears once and corresponds to ""red."" It can also be noted that the sequence or order of words in the input does not change the color that each word translates to. Each word operates independently to produce the same color regardless of its position in the sequence.

Therefore, the underlying rule for ""dax"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,10,dax
"Observing the examples provided, we can see that each instance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

Input: dax -> Output: green

Therefore, we can state:

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""",1.0,10,dax

The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""green"" when adjacent to ""dax,"" but this relationship is not fully clear due to a limited dataset. The word ""bluf"" maps to ""green"" when followed by ""dax,"" but when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" it results in ""green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" does not change its output color based on its position relative to ""dax.""

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue
- wif -> (unclear rule, but green when following dax)
- bluf -> (unclear rule, but green when following dax) 

To confirm the rules for ""wif"" and ""bluf,"" additional context or examples would be necessary. However, the rule for ""dax"" remains consistent throughout the examples provided.",1.0,10,dax
"To deduce the meaning of dax, let's analyze the output corresponding to each input where dax appears:

3. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green

4. Input: zup bluf dax

   Rule: Once again, regardless of position, dax yields the color green.

5. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow
   Rule: In this example, too, the position does not matter, and dax means green.

Based on all the examples, the consistent rule appears to be that the word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green"", regardless of its position within the list of words. Therefore:

dax -> green. Rule: In any given sequence, the word ""dax"" represents the color green.",1.0,10,dax
"From the provided examples, the word ""dax"" seems to be associated with the output ""green"" in every instance.

Every instance of ""wif"" in the input is paired with ""red"" in the output. Regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the sequence or the other words present, its output is consistently ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,10,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output. Additionally, the examples seem to show a pattern where each unique nonce word has a corresponding color:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" also corresponds to ""blue"" (as seen in the fifth example, which could imply it is synonymous with ""lug"" or context-dependent)

Given this pattern, it's reasonable to deduce:

Observation: ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" ""zup"" is followed by yellow once again.

Based on these examples, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,10,zup

Now, by analyzing the examples given, the word ""zup"" appears to always correspond to the output ""yellow."" We can also observe that it does not alter the pattern of the colors that follow or precede it. Therefore, ""zup"" is directly translated to ""yellow"" based on these examples.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,10,zup
"Examining each example provided:

- In the first example, ""dax zup walm wif walm"" correlates to ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red."" Notably, ""dax"" and ""wif"" correspond to ""green"" and ""red,"" respectively. ""Walm"" appears twice and correlates with ""yellow red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" cannot be directly linked to only one color since it precedes both ""yellow"" and ""red."" However, the initial ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and corresponds to ""yellow.""

- In the second example, ""zup wif"" correlates with ""yellow red,"" indicating that ""zup"" might correspond to ""yellow"" (since we already know ""wif"" is ""red"").

- The third example, ""lug dax zup dax wif,"" matches ""blue green yellow green red."" Despite ""lug"" being unknown, ""dax"" is consistent with ""green,"" and ""wif"" is again ""red."" ""zup"" comes before the second occurrence of ""dax"" and corresponds to ""yellow.""

- The fourth example, ""wif zup,"" correlates to ""red yellow,"" where we know ""wif"" is ""red,"" and following this pattern, ""zup"" appears to be ""yellow.""

- In the final example, ""dax zup lug wif lug,"" corresponds to ""green yellow blue red blue."" In this series, ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red"" once again. ""zup"" comes after ""dax"" and before ""lug,"" and matches ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, across all examples, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of the position or context within the series. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,10,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we observe that the word ""zup"" is always followed by the output ""yellow."" There are no instances where ""zup"" is used and ""yellow"" is not the immediate next color in the output. Furthermore, the words around ""zup"" consistently translate to other colors (with ""dax"" being ""green,"" ""wif"" being ""red,"" and ""lug"" being ""blue"") without altering the output color associated with ""zup."" There is no evidence to suggest that the meaning of ""zup"" is context-dependent. Thus, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,10,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can observe that each word corresponds to a specific color in the output:

- The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green.
- The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red.
- The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue.
- The word ""zup"" appears to be consistently associated with the color yellow.

Now let's look closer at the appearance of ""zup"" in each example:

1. In the first example, ""zup"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""walm."" After ""zup,"" the color pattern repeats the preceding colors, with green turning into yellow (for zup) and then followed by ""wif walm walm"" turning into ""red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" might represent red after ""dax"" changes to yellow due to ""zup.""
   
2. In the second example, ""zup"" comes directly before ""wif,"" and the output is ""yellow red,"" which aligns with our prior observation of ""zup"" corresponding to yellow and ""wif"" to red.

3. In the third example, ""zup"" is between two occurrences of ""dax"" and corresponds to yellow, with ""dax"" again corresponding to green both times it appears. The sequence ""lug dax zup dax wif"" corresponds to the colors ""blue green yellow green red.""

4. In the fourth example, ""wif zup"" gives ""red yellow."" Since ""zup"" follows ""wif"" and the pattern from ""wif"" to ""zup"" changes from red to yellow, this is consistent with our observations so far. However, the word ""zup"" follows ""wif"" instead of preceding it as in other examples.

5. In the fifth example, ""dax zup lug wif lug"" translates to ""green yellow blue red blue,"" and we see ""zup"" yielding yellow again.

Based on these observations, we can conclude that:

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position relative to the other words in the sequence.

zup -> yellow",1.0,10,zup
"bluf -> the color that the previous word corresponds to.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" appears, it takes the color of the word immediately preceding it. If the word ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" then ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow."" If ""lug"" means ""blue,"" then ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue."" This pattern is consistent across all examples provided.",1.0,10,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, each input word seems to correlate to a specific color in the output. To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can look for patterns in how the word ""bluf"" is translated in each output:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow green blue,"" where the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green,"" where ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red"" in the output.
- The third example, ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif,"" has ""bluf"" coming between two greens (""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green""), resulting in another green.
- The fourth example, ""zup lug bluf,"" translates to ""yellow blue blue,"" where ""bluf"" translates to ""blue,"" matching the color of ""lug.""
- Lastly, the fifth example, ""zup bluf,"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" where ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow,"" matching the color of ""zup.""

From these observations, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" can be induced as follows: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the immediately preceding word.",1.0,10,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by examining its correspondence with the output colors. To do this systematically, we will compare the instances of ""bluf"" with the output in each example.

- In example 1, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second 'yellow' in the output.
- In example 2, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second 'red' in the output.
- In example 3, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second 'green' in the output.
- In example 4, ""bluf"" corresponds to 'blue' in the output.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second 'yellow' in the output.

Based on the examples, it seems that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it. When there is only one word before ""bluf,"" its output color is repeated. When there is a sequence of different words followed by ""bluf,"" it takes the color of the last word before it.

- In example 1, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the color for ""zup"" is yellow. The output color for ""bluf"" is also yellow.
- In example 2, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the color for ""wif"" is red. The output color for ""bluf"" is red as well.
- In example 3, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the color for ""dax"" is green. The output color for ""bluf"" is green.
- In example 4, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the color for ""lug"" is blue. The output color for ""bluf"" is also blue.
- In example 5, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" and just like in example 1, the output color for both is yellow.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce for ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> meaning: The word ""bluf"" takes the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the second word in the sequence, its color is the same as the first word's color. If there are multiple words before ""bluf"" with different associated colors, ""bluf"" takes the color of the last word before it. Rule: ""bluf"" mimics the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,10,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color that precedes it in the input sequence. If there is no color word before ""bluf,"" it defaults to ""yellow.""

Explanation:

- In the first and fifth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow.""

- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" so ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" translates to ""green.""

- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""

So, based on these examples, the rule for determining the meaning of ""bluf"" is to look at the previous word in the sequence. If that word represents a color, then ""bluf"" assumes that color. If there is no such word, then ""bluf"" defaults to ""yellow.""",1.0,10,bluf
"bluf -> yellow

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Every instance of ""bluf"" in the inputs is matched with ""yellow"" in the outputs, regardless of its position in the sequence.",0.0,10,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to refer to the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the analysis:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and the following word is also ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the following word is also ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the following word is also ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and then follows ""wif""; ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" results in the repetition of these colors respectively in the output.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and the following word is also ""blue.""

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the next word to repeat the color of the word that precedes ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Causes the next word to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before ""walm"".",1.0,10,walm

"Walm -> yellow, under the condition that all the previous colors are identical. If the previous color sequence is not uniform, then walm repeats the preceding color.

"walm -> same color as the previous word. Rule: When ""walm"" is used, it takes on the color of the word before it in the sequence. If there is no word before it (it's the start of the sequence), then ""walm"" is yellow by default.",1.0,10,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that follows it. If ""walm"" is the final word in the sequence, it takes the color of the word that precedes it. Analyzing the patterns:

- Example 1: ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" which outputs ""blue."" The second ""zup"" outputs ""yellow,"" which is not consistent with the first occurrence.
- Example 2: ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" which outputs ""yellow."" ""Dax"" usually outputs ""green.""
- Example 3: ""walm"" is followed by nothing, hence it takes the color of the preceding word ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- Example 4: ""walm"" is both followed by ""wif"" and precedes ""wif,"" with both instances outputting ""red.""
- Example 5: ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" which outputs ""blue."" ""Dax"" usually outputs ""green.""

There is a consistency issue in the examples, as ""zup"" and ""dax"" seem to change colors between examples. However, ""walm"" does appear to mimic the color of the following word, or if at the end, the preceding word. Given the inconsistency in the color outputs of the other words, it's not possible to define a consistent rule for ""walm"" based on the current examples.

Rule: ""walm"" -> takes on the color of the word following it; if it is the last word, it takes on the color of the preceding word. However, due to inconsistencies in the context colors of ""zup"" and ""dax,"" this rule cannot be applied with certainty to define ""walm.""",0.4,10,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" in the output. This is evident because every occurrence of ""lug"" in the inputs corresponds to ""blue"" in the outputs.

Rule: dax -> green.,1.0,11,dax
"Based on the given examples, every single time the word ""dax"" appears, it corresponds to the color green in the output sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,11,dax
"To induce the rule for the word ""dax,"" we should compare the inputs and their corresponding outputs to identify the pattern associated with the word ""dax.""

In every output sequence, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Here are the breakdowns from the examples:

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to red
- ""dax"" corresponds to green
- ""walm"" might correspond to green (needs more examples to confirm)
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue

Input: lug zup dax wif zup
Output: blue yellow green red yellow
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to green
- ""wif"" corresponds to red

Input: wif lug dax lug
Output: red blue green blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to red
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to green

Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
Output: yellow yellow red blue green
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
- ""bluf"" might correspond to yellow (needs more examples to confirm)
- ""wif"" corresponds to red
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to green

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- ""dax"" corresponds to green
- ""bluf"" might correspond to green but since it also appeared as yellow in other example, it needs further investigation, or it could mean that ""bluf"" is context-dependent.

Based on the consistency across the examples, it appears that the rule for ""dax"" is that it always corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence or the context around it.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,11,dax
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,11,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red' each time it is used. Therefore, the rule for the nonce word 'wif' is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,11,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" Therefore:

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,11,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce a rule for what ""wif"" means by comparing the inputs to the outputs:

1. ""wif lug zup bluf"" -> ""red blue yellow yellow""
2. ""zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow green red""
3. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
4. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue""
5. ""zup wif dax walm"" -> ""yellow red green green green""

Let's analyze this by looking at the consistent outcomes for each example:
- Every time ""wif"" appears, ""red"" also appears in the output.
- The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue"".
- The word ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow"".
- The word ""bluf"" is consistently translated to ""yellow"" or ""red"", but every time ""bluf"" is translated to ""red"", it's following ""wif"", suggesting ""wif"" may impact the color assigned to ""bluf"".
- ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green"".

By observing the pattern, each nonce word other than ""wif"" corresponds to a unique color. Meanwhile, ""wif"" always results in the color ""red"". It doesn't vary with position or presence of other words. Therefore, ""wif"" appears to consistently represent the color ""red"", regardless of context.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,11,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following:

- In Example 1, ""wif lug zup bluf"" corresponds to ""red blue yellow yellow"". Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" also to ""yellow,"" it seems reasonable that “wif” corresponds to ""red"".
  
- In Example 2, ""zup dax wif"" translates to ""yellow green red"". Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" so ""wif"" would thus be ""red"" once again.
  
- In Example 3, ""wif bluf"" equals ""red red"". ""Bluf"" is shown to ""yellow"" in the first example, for this to be correct, ""wif"" must be ""red"" to comply with the pattern of output.

- Example 4, ""wif lug walm"" becomes ""red blue blue blue"". ""Lug"" has been established as ""blue,"" so in this example, ""walm"" must correspond to ""blue blue"" as ""wif"" is ""red"".

- In Example 5, ""zup wif dax walm"" is ""yellow red green green green"". ""Zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is “green,” and, if ""walm"" is ""green green,"" it confirms that ""wif"" is ""red"".

Based on the above, the rule seems consistent: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".

"Based on the provided examples, each distinct word seems to correlate with a unique color:

- ""wif"" correlates with the color red.

Whenever ""zup"" appears, the word that follows has been ""walm,"" except in the one instance where ""zup"" appears alone or when it's followed by ""lug."" In each case, ""zup"" precedes the color yellow, regardless of its position. This pattern allows us to deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""zup"" correlates with the color yellow, and it may cause the word following it to take on the color yellow as well unless that word has its predefined color, as seen with ""lug.""

walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word multiple times, based on the number of letters in the preceding color word.",1.0,11,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the word preceding it one additional time. For example, if the word before ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" then ""walm"" means an additional ""yellow"" will be output. If ""walm"" is the first word or follows a series of ""walms,"" the default color to repeat is ""yellow.""

Evidence:

- In the first input ""zup lug walm,"" ""lug"" means ""blue."" After ""walm"" is used, another ""blue"" follows, indicating ""walm"" causes a repetition of ""blue.""
  
- In the second input ""zup walm dax,"" the use of ""walm"" after ""zup"" (which means ""yellow"") results in two ""yellows"" being output before moving on to ""dax"" (which means ""green""), following the rule of repeating the preceding color.
  
- In the third example ""wif dax zup walm,"" the ""walm"" after ""zup"" (""yellow"") results in additional ""yellows"" in the output.

- In the fourth example ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif,"" after ""lug"" (""blue""), ""walm"" leads to additional ""blues."" After ""zup"" (""yellow""), ""walm"" results in additional ""yellows"" again. 

- In the last example, ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" the two instances of ""walm"" follow ""dax"" (""green"") and ""wif"" (""red""), resulting in repetitions of ""green"" and ""red"" respectively.

Therefore, the rule is: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word that directly precedes ""walm"". If ""walm"" is at the beginning or follows another ""walm,"" the color to repeat is ""yellow"".",1.0,11,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns seen with its use in the examples provided:

1. Whenever ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output color sequence includes a repetition of ""yellow"" before changing to another color.
2. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it results in a repetition of the color ""blue.""
3. Following ""dax"" with ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color ""green.""
4. The sequence ""wif ... walm"" leads to a repetition of the color ""red.""

Based on the examples, ""walm"" seems to signify a repetition of the color that would correspond to the word immediately preceding it. The amount of repetition is not consistent across the examples, but the rule is that there will be at least one repetition.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the previous word to repeat.",0.9,11,walm
"lug -> meaning. The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" correlates to the output ""green."" Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" always appears at the corresponding position in the output. No other word or position combination seems to consistently correspond to ""green"" in the output, which supports the conclusion that ""dax"" specifically translates to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green. ""Dax"" means green.",1.0,12,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the examples provided:

1. ""zup bluf dax"" maps to ""yellow yellow green.""
2. ""wif dax zup dax"" maps to ""red green yellow green.""

4. ""dax zup lug wif lug"" maps to ""green yellow blue red blue.""
5. ""zup walm dax lug"" maps to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue.""

From the examples, when ""dax"" appears in various contexts, it consistently maps to the color ""green."" Each instance of ""dax"" directly corresponds to ""green,"" regardless of the other words' positions or meanings. 

Rule: dax -> green

Therefore, the meaning of ""dax"" in the given context is the color green.",1.0,12,dax

In all examples provided, whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green.""",1.0,12,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we are going to analyze the context in which ""dax"" appears and the corresponding output to deduce the underlying rule for the nonce word ""dax.""

Let's examine the occurrences of ""dax"" in the examples:

1. ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""
2. ""wif dax zup dax"" -> ""red green yellow green""
3. ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" -> ""yellow green green yellow green""
4. ""dax zup lug wif lug"" -> ""green yellow blue red blue""
5. ""zup walm dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green blue"" 

From these examples, we can note:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""green.""
- ""dax"" does not depend on its position in the sentence as it consistently translates to ""green,"" whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end of the input string.

Combining these observations, we can induce the rule that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its context or position within the string of words. Therefore,

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the outputs.",1.0,12,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word is associated with a specific color. ""Zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position. ""Wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" 

However, the term ""dax"" seems to change its color output depending on its position or the context within the input sequence. 

Here are the outputs for ""dax"" in the given positions:

- When ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" or ""zup"", it results in ""green"".
- When ""dax"" is the first word, it results in ""green"".
- When ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" it also results in ""green"".

Given these observations, the word ""dax"" seems to always translate to ""green"" no matter the position or context within the input sequence.

Hence, the rule is:

dax -> green",1.0,12,dax
"Based on the examples given, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" each time it appears in the input. Therefore, the meaning can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,12,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that:

- In the first example, ""wif"" precedes colors red, red, and then red again.
- In the second example, ""wif"" is followed by red.
- In the third example, ""wif"" on its own translates to red.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" appears after ""lug"" and ""dax"" which correspond to blue and green respectively, but the color following ""wif"" is red.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" appears twice and each time it is followed by red.

From each instance, we can see that irrespective of the position or what follows, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red in the output.

Rule: wif -> red. Red is the consistent output associated with the word wif.
",1.0,12,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it's possible to induce the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif."" In every output, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" There is no variation in output color regardless of the words that precede or follow ""wif,"" suggesting that ""wif"" has a fixed meaning unrelated to context.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,12,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's examine its consistent appearances across different examples:

Example 1: ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" -> ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue""
Example 2: ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> ""red red blue yellow""
Example 3: ""wif"" -> ""red""
Example 4: ""zup dax lug wif dax"" -> ""yellow green blue red green""
Example 5: ""zup wif lug wif"" -> ""yellow red blue red""

Every time the word ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output color is ""red."" When ""wif"" is not present, various other colors are outputted. The rule seems simple: whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, the output color will be ""red."" 

Rule:
wif -> red",1.0,12,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red in the output. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. No other input word consistently corresponds to ""red"" in these examples, and ""wif"" does not correspond to any other output color. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,12,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" 

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,12,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it is evident that ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. There are no contextual clues indicating that the meaning of ""zup"" is dependent on other factors or that it changes in different contexts. The consistent rule is that every time ""zup"" is mentioned, the output is ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,12,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can infer a rule for what ""zup"" means by identifying the consistent output whenever ""zup"" is input.

In every case where ""zup"" is present, the output is ""yellow."" Therefore, the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,12,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in each given example, regardless of the surrounding words.",1.0,12,zup
"Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,12,zup
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the correlation between input and output in each example, focusing on the position and repetition of the word bluf and other words around it, and how they relate to the colors in the output.

Starting from the first input example:
- Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
- Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green

Bluf appears twice in the input and both times it is followed by the color blue in the output.

Now let's consider the second example:
- Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
- Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow

Bluf is followed by yellow in the output, as before; we may need more data.

The third example:
- Input: zup bluf wif walm
- Output: yellow yellow red red red

Consistently, after bluf, we see yellow followed by the color corresponding to wif, which seems to be red.

The fourth example:
- Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
- Output: green green red yellow blue

Again bluf is followed by green in the output. Notice that the color corresponding to dax seems to affect the color that follows after bluf, which suggests that bluf means ""repeat the color indicated by the previous word.""

The last example solidifies this idea:
- Input: lug bluf zup
- Output: blue blue yellow

Here, bluf is followed by blue, which is the color corresponding to the previous word lug.

Based on the examples, it appears that bluf indicates repetition of the color that corresponds to the immediately preceding word in the input sequence.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color indicated by the previous word.

Hence, the rule is:
bluf -> Repeat the color indicated by the previous word.",1.0,12,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that immediately follows it. If there is no word following it, bluf takes the color of the word that precedes it.

Here's how the rule applies to each example:

- ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax"" matches to ""red blue blue yellow yellow green"" because the first ""bluf"" takes the color of the following word ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" and the second ""bluf"" takes the color of the following word ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
- ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" matches to ""yellow yellow red green red yellow"" because ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which is ""red.""
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" matches to ""yellow yellow red red red"" because ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" and ""walm"" seems to take the color ""red"" since it directly follows ""wif.""
- ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" matches to ""green green red yellow blue"" because ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which is ""red.""
- ""lug bluf zup"" matches to ""blue blue yellow"" because ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

Thus, the rule I have induced is that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word immediately after it, or if no word follows, then the color of the word before it.",1.0,12,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> the color that corresponds to the word immediately following it in the sequence. 

Therefore, bluf takes on the ""color"" meaning of the word after it:
- In the first example, ""bluf zup bluf dax"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow green,"" where ""bluf"" takes the color meaning of the word that follows: zup (yellow) and dax (green).
- In the second example, ""zup bluf wif"" means ""yellow yellow red,"" with ""bluf"" taking on the color meaning of ""wif"" which is red.
- In the third example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red"" with ""bluf"" taking on the color meaning of ""wif"" which is red. ""Walm"" doesn't have a stated color but seems to inherit red from ""wif.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax bluf wif zup lug,"" the ""bluf"" takes on the color meaning of ""wif"" (red) and is followed by ""zup"" (yellow) and ""lug"" (blue).
- In the last example, ""lug bluf zup,"" ""bluf"" takes on the color meaning of ""zup"" which is yellow.

Bluf -> the color of the word following it (red for ""wif,"" yellow for ""zup,"" green for ""dax,"" and blue for ""lug"").",1.0,12,bluf

Additionally, the other words in each series appear to have a consistent mapping to other colors: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> blue",0.8,12,bluf
"walm -> meaning: The word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three additional times. 

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" follows a color-word (zup, lug, dax, etc.), it causes the output to include three more instances of the color associated with that word. For example:

- ""zup wif walm"" outputs ""yellow red red red,"" where ""zup"" equals ""yellow,"" ""wif"" equals ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color ""red"" three times.

- ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" outputs ""green green green red blue green green green,"" where ""dax"" equals ""green,"" ""wif"" equals ""red,"" ""lug"" equals ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color ""green"" after each ""dax.""

2. Input: ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - The first ""lug"" -> ""blue"", followed by ""wif"" -> ""red"", then ""lug"" again -> ""blue"", then ""walm"" makes ""lug"" repeat as ""blue blue"", next ""zup"" -> ""yellow"", and ""walm"" causes ""zup"" to repeat as ""yellow yellow yellow"", ending with ""wif"" -> ""red""

3. Input: ""dax walm wif lug dax walm""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in ""green green green"", followed by ""wif"" -> ""red"", ""lug"" -> ""blue,"" and ""dax"" -> ""green"", with another ""walm"" causing ""dax"" to repeat as ""green green green""

4. Input: ""dax wif walm""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" after ""wif"" causes it to repeat as ""red red red""

   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" following ""dax"" leads to ""green green green""

The rule that can be induced is as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" makes the color associated with the word that directly follows ""walm"" (or precedes it if ""walm"" ends the phrase) be repeated three times.

Therefore:

walm -> causes the next word's color to repeat three times",1.0,12,walm
"walm -> meaning. The meaning of walm can be deduced from the pattern that follows its use in each input. 

Rule: ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to repeat three times in the output. For example:

- In ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif,"" ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" and ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In ""dax walm wif lug dax walm,"" ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" both times it appears.
- In ""dax wif walm,"" ""wif"" before ""walm"" results in ""red red red.""

4. ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red""
5. ""lug zup dax walm"" -> ""blue yellow green green green""

Analyzing the outputs, after each occurrence of ""walm,"" the color sequences start with red and are followed by a repetition of a previously mentioned color: 

- In example 1, ""walm"" is followed by ""red red red,"" which corresponds to the color of ""wif"" which is ""red.""
- In example 2, ""lug walm"" gives us ""blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup walm"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In example 3, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In example 4, ""walm"" is again followed by ""red red red,"" corresponding to ""wif"" which is ""red.""
- In example 5, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" represents the rule of repeating the color before it three times, following an initial ""red"". However, we must remember that ""walm"" follows another word in each case, and it is this word that determines the color to be repeated.

- ""Bluf"" also corresponds to ""red"" in all examples when not directly followed by another word except in the first example. However, there's no direct counterexample to contradict this, indicating that ""bluf"" might still pair with ""red"" in a general case.
- There isn't any instance of ""bluf"" not being followed by ""red"" in the output.

From this, we can deduce that ""bluf"" most likely corresponds to the color ""red"".

Rule: bluf -> red.",1.0,13,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can determine the following correlations between words and colors:

- Every time the word ""zup"" appears, the output color is ""yellow"".
- Every time the word ""wif"" appears, the output color is ""red"".
- Every time the word ""dax"" appears, the output color is ""green"".

Also, there is consistency in the outputs when we see the word ""bluf"". It always precedes a color. We can thus conclude that ""bluf"" doesn't cause a change in the color output, but instead, the same color appears as the word (or rules) just before it. 

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> The output color is the same as the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".

Rule: If a word X corresponds to a color C and is immediately followed by the word ""bluf"", then the output for ""bluf"" will also be color C.",1.0,13,bluf
"To figure out the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" followed by ""wif,"" as in the first and third input, the output pattern is ""yellow yellow red red."" This suggests that ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- In the second input, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" and before ""zup,"" which results in ""green green yellow."" Since ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green"" and ""dax"" alone translates to ""green,"" the presence of ""bluf"" here changes the output color for ""dax"" (from ""green"" to ""green green"").
- In the fourth input, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and is followed by ""zup,"" with the output being ""red red yellow."" It seems that ""bluf"" following ""wif"" retains the ""red"" color but duplicates it.
- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""dax"" (at the beginning and end), which results in a double ""green"" each time.

From the information above, it seems that the rule for ""bluf"" is that it duplicates the color of the preceding word. Checking this against all the examples:

- If ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow""), it duplicates ""yellow.""
- If ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (which translates to ""red""), it duplicates ""red.""
- If ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (which translates to ""green""), it duplicates ""green.""

So the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the previous word.",1.0,13,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to look at the pattern in which colors are outputted in relation to the input words.

Looking at the first example:

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

We see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" also to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" is not directly associated with a color but seems to continue the pattern of ""red.""

In the second example:

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green

Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Following the sequencing from the input to output, ""bluf"" seems to equate to ""green.""

However, there might be a confusion here since ""green"" has already been taken by ""dax."" Let's continue analyzing the remaining examples to solidify our findings.

The third example:

Input: zup bluf wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow red red

Again, we see ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" matches with ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

In the fourth example:

Input: wif bluf zup
Output: red red yellow

Here too, ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

Lastly, in the fifth example:

Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax
Output: green green yellow yellow green

This implies ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""bluf"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" is again ""green.""

We have mixed signals regarding ""bluf."" In some instances, it corresponds to ""yellow,"" and in others to ""green."" To determine the general rule, I need to analyze the pattern.

From the second and fifth example, we see that ""bluf"" directly following ""dax"" results in ""green.""

From the first, third, and fourth examples, ""bluf"" directly follows ""zup"" and results in ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is:
bluf -> red when following ""wif""
bluf -> green when following ""dax""
bluf -> yellow when following ""zup""

Thus, ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word it directly follows (with ""wif"" always preceding red, ""dax"" always preceding green, and ""zup"" always preceding yellow).",0.9,13,bluf
"bluf -> meaning: green

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is the color ""green.""",0.0,13,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can observe the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Here's a breakdown of each example:

1. Input: ""zup walm"" 
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   
   ""Zup"" must correlate to the output ""yellow,” and ""walm"" is also producing ""yellow.""

2. Input: ""dax wif walm""
   Output: ""green red red red""
   
   ""Dax"" correlates with ""green"" and ""wif"" with ""red"". ""Walm"" appears to replicate the color corresponding to the word before it thrice.

3. Input: ""lug zup dax walm""
   Output: ""blue yellow green green green""
   
   Here ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" is ""green."" The ""walm"" again appears to replicate the color of the word before it, ""dax"" (green), three times.

4. Input: ""dax lug wif walm""
   Output: ""green blue red red red""
   
   Given the pattern, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"" and ""wif"" with ""red."" ""Walm"" is repeating the color of ""wif"" three times.

5. Input: ""dax walm wif""
   Output: ""green green green red""
   
   ""Dax"" results in ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color green three times before the last word ""wif"" gives us ""red.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the previous word three times. 

Rule: walm -> Replicates the color of the word preceding it three times.",1.0,13,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to represent repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here is the breakdown:

1. ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"" – ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" repeats it two extra times.
2. ""dax wif walm"" outputs ""green red red red"" – ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""walm"" repeats ""red"" two extra times.
3. ""lug zup dax walm"" outputs ""blue yellow green green green"" – ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" two extra times.
4. ""dax lug wif walm"" outputs ""green blue red red red"" – ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""walm"" repeats ""red"" two extra times.
5. ""dax walm wif"" outputs ""green green green red"" – ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""walm"" repeats ""green"" two extra times, and ""wif"" adds a ""red"" at the end.

Considering the consistency across examples, here is the rule:

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word two additional times.",1.0,13,walm
"Walm -> meaning. 

Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to be connected to repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it, a number of times equal to the number of letters in the preceding word. 

For instance: 
- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" and since ""zup"" is three letters long, ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three times.
- In ""dax wif walm,"" ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and it has three letters, so ""walm"" results in ""red"" being repeated three times. 
- In “lug zup dax walm”, “dax” comes before “walm,” and as ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" and has three letters, ""walm"" results in ""green"" said three times.
- In “dax lug wif walm,” “wif” comes before ""walm,"" and since ""wif"" is associated with ""red"" and has three letters, ""walm"" results in “red” repeated three times.
- In “dax walm wif,” we see that “walm” follows “dax,” so ""green"" is repeated three times, as ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" and has three letters. The ""wif"" at the end simply adds ""red,"" and it doesn't affect the repetition rule of ""walm.""

Rule: ""Walm"" repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word a number of times equal to the number of letters in that word.",1.0,13,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" correlates with the repetition of the color word that precedes it. Each instance of ""walm"" in the input is followed by repeated color words in the output. The repetition count matches the number of syllables in the word just before ""walm"" in the input.

Let's break down the examples to deduce the rule:

- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"": ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and since ""zup"" has one syllable, ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""yellow"" three times.
- ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red"": ""dax"" leads to ""green"", but it is not followed directly by ""walm""; instead, ""wif"" comes next and leads to ""red,"" which is followed directly by ""walm."" ""wif"" has one syllable, resulting in ""red"" being repeated three times.
- ""lug zup dax walm"" -> ""blue yellow green green green"": In this example, ""dax"" is the word before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""green."" ""dax"" has one syllable, so ""green"" is repeated three times.
- ""dax lug wif walm"" -> ""green blue red red red"": Here, the word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and since ""wif"" has one syllable, ""red"" is repeated three times.
- ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red"": In this case, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green"" being repeated three times, suggesting the rule applies when ""walm"" follows the color denomination, not just anywhere in the sequence. ""wif"" at the end corresponds to adding ""red"" once.

From these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

**Rule:** walm -> The word preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output, regardless of its syllable count, ignoring any non-color words in-between.

However, it is important to note that the last example breaks this rule by outputting three repetitions of ""green"" when ""walm"" directly follows ""dax."" Hence, all words preceding ""walm"" in the output are repeated three times, regardless of their position relative to ""walm,"" when ""walm"" is not at the end of the input. If ""walm"" is at the end of the input, it causes the prior word to be repeated based on the syllable count of the word preceding ""walm.""

Considering this exception, a more accurate rule could be:

**Rule:** walm -> It causes the word that represents a color and precedes it to be repeated three times in the output. If ""walm"" is at the end of the input string, it causes said color to be repeated based on the syllable count of the word, overriding the three-times repetition rule.",0.9,13,walm
"Based on the input and output pairs provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repeating pattern of a particular color. The color seems to be determined by the word that precedes ""walm."" We can deduce the following rules for what color each word represents:

- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""wif"" -> red

To deduce the rule for ""walm,"" let's analyze each example:

1. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" This suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it three times.

2. ""dax wif walm"" results in ""green red red red."" Since ""wif"" is before ""walm,"" and the output is three reds, the pattern of ""walm"" repeating the color of the preceding word is confirmed but it includes the color of ""wif"" as well.

3. ""lug zup dax walm"" results in ""blue yellow green green green."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is three greens, again showing the repetition of the color associated with the word before ""walm.""

4. ""dax lug wif walm"" results in ""green blue red red red."" The order of the words affects the individual colors, but ""walm"" still leads to three repetitions of the last color which is red.

5. ""dax walm wif"" appears to break the pattern slightly because we get three greens before the red, which is associated with ""wif"" that follows ""walm."" Thus, it would seem ""walm"" repeats the color of itself (since it follows ""dax,"" which is green) and adds the color associated with the word following it.

Combining the observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it three times, unless there's a word after ""walm,"" in which case ""walm"" also includes the color associated with the subsequent word at the end of the sequence.

"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" This is evident from each instance where the input ""dax"" appears.

- ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" though less certain since it appears only once in the given examples, seems to correspond to ""red""

"Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following:

- When the input is solely ""dax"", the output is consistently ""green"".
- When ""dax"" appears in a sequence of nonce words, it continues to correspond to the output ""green"", regardless of its position in the sequence.

From the given information, ""dax"" seems to be a noun that is represented by the color green. However, it is not sufficient to infer why other nonce words correspond to other colors, as there are no repeated patterns or clear rules regarding their correlations to specific outputs.

Thus, the rule inferred is:

Across all provided examples, the word 'wif' consistently results in 'red' in the output:

Rule: bluf repeats the last mentioned color in the sequence.

Therefore:

"From the examples provided, we can compare the input with the output to try to determine the meaning or rule associated with the word ""bluf."" Let's examine the pairs of input and output one by one:

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green

Input: zup bluf

It seems that whenever the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output an equal number of times directly following the output translation for the word that precedes ""bluf."" For example:

1. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" where ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" repeats the output for the word that comes directly before it.
2. ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red,"" where ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the output for ""wif.""
3. ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" translates to ""red yellow yellow red green,"" again showing that ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the output for the word that comes just before it (""yellow"").

4. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
   Output: red yellow yellow red green

5. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

From examples 1 and 5, whenever ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow"". This suggests that the presence of ""zup"" followed by ""bluf"" translates into a repetition of the color corresponding to ""zup"", which is yellow.

From example 2 which is repeated as example 3, whenever ""lug wif"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""blue red red"". Here, ""bluf"" following ""lug wif"" results in the repetition of the color corresponding to ""wif"", which is red.

In example 4, ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" translates into ""red yellow yellow red green"". Here, ""bluf"" is between ""zup"" and ""wif"" and the output repeats ""yellow"" as in examples 1 and 5. However, ""wif"" is after ""bluf"" in this sequence, and the output color corresponding to ""wif"" is not repeated.

Given these observations, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, if ""bluf"" comes after ""lug wif"", ""wif"" is red and ""red"" is repeated; if after ""zup"", ""zup"" is yellow, and ""yellow"" is repeated.

"Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" is associated with varying repetitions of the immediately preceding color word. Each occurrence of ""walm"" replaces the color word that comes just before it with repetitions of that color word.

- Example 2: zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
- Example 3: zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
- Example 4: zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
- Example 5: dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

In examples 3 and 4, ""zup"" is yellow, and it is followed by ""walm,"" which results in two additional yellow repetitions, yielding three yellows in total.

In example 1, ""dax"" becomes ""green"" followed by ""walm,"" resulting in two additional greens, giving three greens in total.

In example 2, ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" follows, resulting in three reds in total.

In example 5, ""wif"" is red followed by ""walm,"" giving us three reds. Later, ""zup"" is blue followed by ""walm,"" resulting in three yellows.

Therefore,

Rule: walm -> repeat the color word that appears immediately before it two more times.",1.0,14,walm

- lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
- zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
- dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

By looking at the relationship between the input and the output, it seems that ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat the immediately preceding color.

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds with green, resulting in additional 'green' outputs.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds with red, and the next outputs are red until the next word ""lug"" which turns the output to blue.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""walm"" is after ""zup"" and the output is continuously yellow, showing that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the previous word without changing it until a new word gives a new color.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which is green, and then ""lug"" which is blue, each time repeating the color of the previous word.

Thus, based on these observations, it appears the rule is:

4. Input: zup walm

- ""wif"" consistently yields ""red.""
- ""dax"" yields ""green"" when it is in the first position.

- When ""walm"" is followed by a different non-repeating word like ""zup,"" it results in ""yellow"" after any repeated colors.

"Based on the given examples, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position or the presence of other words. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,15,lug
"Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the repeated and consistent association of the nonce word ""lug"" with the output ""blue"" across all examples, we can deduce that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".",1.0,15,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.",1.0,15,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" 

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,15,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position within the input sequence.",1.0,15,lug
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" from the given examples, let's look for patterns where ""dax"" appears and what occurs in the output when it does.

Looking at each instance:

1. ""dax walm wif walm"" leads to ""green green green red red red""
2. ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" leads to ""yellow yellow red blue green""
3. ""dax lug"" leads to ""green blue""
4. ""wif dax zup walm"" leads to ""red green yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""lug dax wif"" leads to ""blue green red""

Now let's try to analyze these patterns:

- In the 1st and 4th examples, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the output is ""green"" followed by ""yellow"" for ""walm."" It is not conclusive in the first instance since ""walm"" also follows ""dax,"" making it unclear what the specific meaning of ""dax"" is.
- In the 2nd example, ""dax"" is the last word of the input and corresponds to ""green"" as the last color in the output.
- In the 3rd example, ""dax"" comes before ""lug"" and leads to ""green"" preceding ""blue,"" which is the output for ""lug.""
- In the 5th example, ""dax"" is between ""lug"" and ""wif,"" and ""green"" is between ""blue"" (output for ""lug"") and ""red"" (output for ""wif"").

Considering that ""dax"" is the only word that consistently leads to ""green"" in the output regardless of position or adjacent words, we can deduce that:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" 

So the rule is:
dax -> green",1.0,15,dax
"To determine the meaning of the word ""dax,"" let's examine the examples and outputs provided:

1. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
2. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
   Output: yellow yellow red blue green
3. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue
4. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
5. Input: lug dax wif
   Output: blue green red

Analyzing these examples, we can see the following patterns:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output.
- The word ""dax"" does not seem to affect the color associated with the other words. For example, in inputs 1 and 4, ""walm"" appears after ""dax"", but the color for ""walm"" remains yellow in the output, unaffected by the presence of ""dax.""
- The position of ""dax"" within the input doesn't change its associated output; it is always ""green.""

Based on this analysis:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,15,dax
"Based on the given examples, we notice that the output color changes depending on the position of ""dax"" within the input series of words. To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look for the pattern that associates the input with its corresponding output. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   The first word ""dax"" corresponds to the first color ""green.""

2. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
   Output: yellow yellow red blue green
   The last word ""dax"" corresponds to the last color ""green.""

3. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue
   The first word ""dax"" corresponds to the first color ""green.""

4. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   The second word ""dax"" corresponds to the second color ""green.""

5. Input: lug dax wif
   Output: blue green red
   The second word ""dax"" corresponds to the second color ""green.""

Looking at the pattern, it's clear that no matter the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence, it corresponds to ""green"" in the output sequence. Therefore, we conclude the rule for the nonce word:

Rule: dax -> green. 

No matter the context, ""dax"" is always associated with the color green.",1.0,15,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's compare the inputs with their respective outputs:

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red
Green is repeated as many times as ""dax"" and ""walm"" appear, subsequently red follows for ""wif"" and is repeated as many times as ""wif"" appears.

Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
Output: yellow yellow red blue green
Here, ""dax"" at the end of the sequence yields ""green"" once again.

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue
""dax"" again corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
""dax"" is associated with ""green"" once more and appears after ""wif"" which yields ""red"".

Input: lug dax wif
Output: blue green red
Once again, ""dax"" follows ""lug"" which is ""blue"" and precedes ""wif"" which is ""red"".

From these examples, it is evident that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green,"" irrespective of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the surrounding words. 

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,15,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the patterns in the examples provided.

- In the first example, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm wif walm,"" and the output is ""green green green red red red."" Notably, ""walm"" occurs twice, leading to three ""green"" outputs. This suggests ""walm"" corresponds to ""green."" However, the first ""green"" corresponds to ""dax,"" hinting that ""dax"" might also mean ""green.""

- In the second input, ""dax"" follows ""lug,"" and the outputs associated with these are ""blue green."" This reinforces the idea that ""dax"" could mean ""green,"" since the output for ""dax"" is ""green"" here as well.

- The third input is ""dax lug,"" with output ""green blue."" This is consistent with our previous observation that ""dax"" means ""green"" and ""lug"" means ""blue.""

- In the fourth example, ""dax"" appears after ""wif"" and before ""zup walm."" The output sequence is ""red green yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to the second color, ""green,"" adding further evidence to our hypothesis.

- The fifth example includes ""lug dax wif,"" with the output being ""blue green red."" Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Based on these observations, the rule regarding the meaning of ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: dax -> green.",0.9,15,dax
Rule: wif -> red.,1.0,15,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs:

- Input: wif -> Output: red
- Input: wif -> Output: red
- Input: wif lug wif -> Output: red blue red
- Input: wif bluf zup -> Output: red red yellow

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" in this context is:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""",1.0,15,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,15,wif
"wif -> red

"wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" consistently in all provided examples.",1.0,15,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that surround it.",1.0,15,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, independent of context.",1.0,15,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.",1.0,15,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input string.",1.0,15,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,15,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns between the inputs and outputs.

1. Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears after ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue"" for ""lug bluf"" followed by a different color. Thus, ""lug bluf"" results in a repetition of the color associated with ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

2. When ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" as in ""zup bluf wif bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow"" followed by ""red red."" This time, ""bluf"" repeated the color associated with ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

3. In the case of ""dax wif bluf,"" the output ""green red red"" shows that ""bluf"" again results in repeating the color before it, which is ""red.""

4. ""dax zup bluf"" again shows the repetition pattern with ""yellow yellow"" following ""zup.""

5. Finally, ""dax bluf wif zup"" results in ""green green,"" repeating the color associated with ""dax,"" followed by other colors.

Rule: bluf -> The rule appears to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Hence:
bluf -> meaning. When ""bluf"" follows a word, it results in repeating the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,15,bluf
"Observing the given input and output pairs, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to repeating the color word that comes immediately before it in the output. Here are the observations:

1. In ""lug bluf wif,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and then ""bluf"" repeats ""blue.""
2. In ""zup bluf wif bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" is used twice, repeating ""yellow"" twice before moving on to ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red.""
3. In ""dax wif bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color that came before it, which is ""red.""
4. In ""dax zup bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" repeats ""yellow.""
5. In ""dax bluf wif zup,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" repeats ""green,"" then comes ""wif"" for ""red,"" followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" causes the previously mentioned color to be repeated in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color mentioned immediately before it.",1.0,15,bluf
"bluf -> same color as the previous word.

Rule: When ""bluf"" appears after another word, it assumes the color that is represented by the word immediately preceding it. If ""bluf"" is the first word, this rule cannot be applied due to lack of previous context.",1.0,15,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to take on the color of the word that precedes it. When the word ""bluf"" is the first word, or when there is no color word before it, it defaults to ""blue."" Let's see whether this rule applies systematically to the provided examples:

1. ""lug bluf wif"" gives ""blue blue red."" If ""lug"" means ""blue,"" then ""bluf"" after ""lug"" also means ""blue.""

2. ""zup bluf wif bluf"" gives ""yellow yellow red red."" Here, ""zup"" means ""yellow."" The first ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and takes the meaning ""yellow,"" and the second ""bluf"" follows the first ""bluf"" (which meant ""yellow""), hence it also means ""yellow.""

3. ""dax wif bluf"" gives ""green red red."" In this case, ""dax"" means ""green,"" ""wif"" means ""red,"" and ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" so ""bluf"" takes the meaning ""red.""

4. ""dax zup bluf"" gives ""green yellow yellow."" Here, ""dax"" means ""green,"" ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" so ""bluf"" means ""yellow.""

5. ""dax bluf wif zup"" gives ""green green red yellow."" We see ""dax"" means ""green,"" and ""bluf"" immediately follows, taking the same meaning ""green;"" ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

So the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word. When there is no preceding color word, ""bluf"" defaults to ""blue."" Applying this rule, we can write the definition as follows:

bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word; if there is no preceding word or the preceding word is not a color, ""bluf"" means ""blue.""",1.0,15,bluf
"bluf -> the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word.

Rule: If a word precedes [bluf], the output is the color associated with that preceding word repeated once. If the word [wif] follows [bluf], there's an additional [red] regardless of the preceding word.",0.8,15,bluf
"walm -> meaning. The presence of the word ""walm"" indicates that the color word that immediately precedes it should be repeated three times.

Rule: If ""X walm"" is present in the input, the output should be ""color associated with X"" repeated three times.",1.0,15,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can analyze the patterns presented in the examples:

1. In ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green."" 
   We notice that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

2. In ""lug walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
   Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and the output contains only ""blue,"" this suggests that ""walm"" might also mean ""blue.""

3. In ""zup walm lug,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue.""
   Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and there is an extra ""yellow,"" which we could deduce comes from ""walm.""

4. In ""dax walm,"" the output is ""green green green.""
   Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the output contains only ""green,"" this supports the idea that ""walm"" takes on the meaning of the word that precedes it.

5. In ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow.""
   ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" does not have a direct correspondence but is followed by ""blue,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Notably, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output has an extra ""yellow"" corresponding to where ""walm"" is in the input.

Based on the patterns observed, ""walm"" appears to replicate the meaning or the corresponding color of the word that comes immediately before it. Therefore, ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" means to repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,15,walm
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to result in a sequence of three colors that correspond to the word preceding ""walm."" In each instance of ""walm,"" the output is three repetitions of the same color that is associated with the word before ""walm."" We have:

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which suggests ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" which suggests ""lug"" means ""blue.""
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" which suggests ""dax"" means ""green.""

Therefore, based on the examples provided, ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,15,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it can be deduced that the word ""walm"" generates a repetition of the color word that precedes it. In every example where ""walm"" is used, the color word immediately before ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output.

Let's look at the patterns:

- In the first example, ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow"") is followed by ""walm,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue"") is followed by ""walm,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- In the third example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and again ""yellow"" is repeated three times in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green"") is followed by ""walm,"" and the output is ""green green green.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" comes before ""walm"" again, and ""yellow"" is repeated three times followed by the color indicated by ""zup"" (yellow).

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as follows:

walm -> Causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times in the output.

Putting it in a formula:

color word + ""walm"" -> color word output repeated three times",1.0,15,walm
"Rule: ""walm"" when used in a sequence causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times in the output.

Therefore: walm -> repeat the preceding color word three times.",1.0,15,walm
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,16,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: When ""lug"" is presented in the input, it translates to ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,16,lug
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following color associations:

- bluf -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

To find out what ""lug"" means, we can look for patterns in the data:

1. When ""lug"" appears at the beginning, as in ""lug bluf wif"" and ""lug wif bluf,"" the first output color is blue.
2. When ""lug"" follows ""wif,"" as in the second example ""wif lug,"" the output following ""wif"" is blue.
3. When ""lug"" precedes ""dax"" as in the fourth example, the output after the ""dax"" sequence is blue as long as ""lug"" came after ""wif.""
4. Additionally, when ""lug"" is followed by ""wif,"" such as in the example ""lug wif zup wif,"" we also see the output following ""lug"" as blue.

These observations suggest a pattern that ""lug"" translates to the color blue, regardless of its position in the input. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,16,lug
"lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently replaced with the color ""blue"" in each example.",1.0,16,lug
Rule: lug -> blue.,1.0,16,lug
"Rule: dax -> green.

Whenever ""dax"" appears as an input, the output invariably starts with ""green,"" regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the combination of other words present. Thus, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output.",1.0,16,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following relationships between the input words and their outputs:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"".
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"".
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
- ""walm"" produces a double output of the color following it, in this case ""yellow"" and ""blue"".

There is no explicit pattern that ties the meaning of ""dax"" to the context of the rest of the sentence in terms of position or the words around it; ""dax"" simply translates the same way in each case.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,16,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.",1.0,16,dax
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" always corresponds to the output ""red."" There is no variation in the output related to ""wif"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context provided by surrounding words. Therefore, we can establish a rule that directly translates the word ""wif"" to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,16,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word translates to a specific color:

- lug -> blue
- bluf -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- walm -> yellow (deduced from the 4th input where walm precedes lug which is blue and since zup is already defined as yellow its safe to assume walm is also yellow)

In each example, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"", regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it. Thus:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,16,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to correspond to the color ""red"" in the Output. Every time ""wif"" is present in the Input, ""red"" appears in the Output.

To confirm, we can look at the first example:
Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
Output: blue red red green blue blue

""Wif"" appears after ""lug"" (blue) and before ""bluf"" (blue again), but the Output has ""red"" in the middle of ""blue"". The second item in both the Input and Output corresponds to ""wif"" and ""red"" respectively.

Similarly, in all other examples, whenever ""wif"" appears, ""red"" is the Output. Regardless of the placement of ""wif"" in the sequence, ""red"" is the consistent output.

Given this pattern, the rule can be deduced as:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".",1.0,16,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in every given example.",1.0,16,wif

"Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the nonce word 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow'. Each time 'zup' appears in the input, 'yellow' appears in the corresponding output.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,16,zup
"Based on the examples given, it appears that the word ""bluf"" represents the color ""red"". However, it must be noted that the color ""red"" is represented by ""wif"" in other instances. Therefore, it seems that ""bluf"" represents a modification of the rule involving ""wif"" to produce ""red"", likely inverting the next color mentioned after it to red. But this rule is not consistent as seen in the last example where ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"" without an expected inversion.

A closer observation of the examples reveals that ""bluf"" always results in ""red"" being followed by a non-""red"" color. ""Bluf"" directly corresponds with ""red"" when it follows any word other than ""wif"". When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red"", and after ""bluf"" the non-""red"" color appears (which in the original input was the color that would've followed the color corresponding to ""wif"").

To propose a consistent rule: ""bluf"" becomes ""red"" and ensures that the color that follows ""bluf"" is also always red if ""wif"" is the word right before ""bluf"", otherwise it follows with the corresponding color translation. But this rule is not absolute and may require a specific exception for the ""wif bluf lug"" sequence to maintain consistency, as it results in two occurrences of ""red"" (perhaps due to a special rule when ""bluf"" immediately follows ""wif"").

From these observations, the closest rule we can deduce is:

Rule: bluf -> ""red"", with modifications potentially influenced by the word that precedes it.",0.01,16,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,0.0,16,bluf

Rule: bluf -> red,0.0,16,bluf
"From the examples provided, we can observe the following patterns:

1. ""lug walm"" consistently results in ""blue blue blue.""
2. ""dax walm"" consistently results in ""green green green.""
3. ""lug walm dax"" results in an extension of the ""lug walm"" pattern with an additional ""green"" appended (blue blue blue + green).
4. ""wif lug dax walm"" results in a new color ""red"" followed by the pattern for ""lug dax"" (blue green) and then three ""green"" colors, which is the pattern for ""dax walm.""

From these patterns, it seems that ""walm"" acts as a rule that states: repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" three times. Therefore:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated thrice.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""green"" is repeated thrice.
- The word ""wif"" alone results in the color ""red,"" but when combined with ""lug"" and ""dax,"" the pattern suggests that ""lug dax"" is treated as a single entity, and the word ""wif"" does not influence the output associated with ""walm.""

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

Rule: If a word has a designated color (lug -> blue, dax -> green), then the word ""walm"" following it means to repeat that color three times.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" produces a triplet repetition of the color indicated by the word preceding it. Below is a breakdown of the inputs and the corresponding outputs that lead to this conclusion:

- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" which indicates that ""walm"" following ""lug"" repeats the word ""blue"" three times.
- ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green,"" which means ""walm"" produces ""blue"" three times as it follows ""lug,"" and after ""walm,"" the ""dax"" adds ""green.""
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" which indicates that ""walm"" following ""dax"" repeats the word ""green"" three times.
- ""wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""red blue green green green,"" which suggests that ""walm"" follows the same rule and repeats the preceding color word (""green"") three times, despite the presence of other words before ""dax.""

Rule: If ""x"" is a color word, then ""x walm"" translates to ""x x x.""",0.8,16,walm
"Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to result in a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word preceding it. Each unique word before ""walm"" is mapped to a specific color:

- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

When ""walm"" follows these words, the output is a repetition of the respective color:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green""

Additionally, it seems that when more than one color word is present before ""walm"", the output is a single instance of each corresponding color followed by repetitions of the color that corresponds to the last word before ""walm"":

- ""lug walm dax"" yields ""blue blue blue green,"" with ""blue"" corresponding to ""lug"" and ""green"" to ""dax"". The last color, green, is repeated due to the presence of ""walm"" after ""dax"".
- ""wif lug dax walm"" yields ""red blue green green green,"" with ""red"" corresponding to ""wif"", ""blue"" to ""lug"", and ""green"" to ""dax"". As ""dax"" is the last word before ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated.

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of position or occurrence in the input sequence.",1.0,17,wif
"To deduce the meaning of 'wif', let's first extract patterns from the given examples:

In each output, 'red' appears each time the word 'wif' appears in the input.

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- 'wif' and 'walm' correspond to 'red'.

Input: wif zup bluf
Output: red yellow yellow
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red', 'zup' and 'bluf' to 'yellow'.

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
- 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', 'bluf' remains consistent with 'blue', and 'wif' with 'red'.

Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', 'lug' to 'blue', and 'wif' continues to output 'red'.

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow
- 'dax' and 'walm' correspond to 'green', 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'.

Based on these observations, the word 'wif' consistently corresponds to the color 'red' in each output, regardless of the other words it is paired with.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,17,wif

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" I will analyze the provided examples and look for patterns.

1. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
2. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
3. zup bluf wif dax lug -> yellow yellow red green blue
4. lug bluf -> blue blue
5. dax bluf -> green green

In each output, the word ""bluf"" is followed by a color that repeats the color outputted by the word just before ""bluf.""

1. In the first example, ""dax"" resulted in ""green,"" and ""bluf"" also gives ""green.""
2. In the fifth example, there is a repetition, ""dax"" gives ""green"" again and so does ""bluf.""

However, in the third example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" also results in ""yellow."" The same duplication of the preceding color occurs in the fourth example with ""lug"" and ""bluf"" both producing ""blue.""

Based on this pattern, I deduce the rule for ""bluf"" as follows:

bluf -> The color output of ""bluf"" matches the color output of the word that precedes it.

Rule: If a word X is followed by bluf, then the output color for bluf will be the same as the output color for X.",1.0,17,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" when it follows the word ""dax"" and translates to the same color as the preceding word when it does not follow ""dax"".

For instance:
- ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green""
- ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"" (since ""lug"" translates to ""blue"")
- When placed after any other word, like ""zup bluf,"" it becomes ""yellow yellow"" (as ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"")",1.0,17,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe a pattern that relates the nonce word ""bluf"" to a specific color output. Here are the observations:

- dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
- dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
- zup bluf wif dax lug -> yellow yellow red green blue
- lug bluf -> blue blue
- dax bluf -> green green

From these observations, it seems that the word ""bluf"" results in an output color that matches the color output of the word preceding it. Here are the corresponding word-to-color mappings we can infer:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue

So the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it takes the color of the preceding word:

"Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word, three times.",1.0,17,walm

When following ""lug"" which outputs ""blue,"" ""walm"" produces two additional ""blue"" outputs. If ""walm"" follows another ""walm,"" it seems to add one less green than the previous instance, possibly because the sequence has been interrupted by the introduction of a new ""walm,"" suggesting a cumulative but resettable pattern based on previous color sequences.",1.0,17,walm
"walm -> repetition. Rule: The word ""walm"" following any other word induces the repetition of the color associated with the last mentioned word as many times as the total number of words before ""walm"" plus one.",1.0,17,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the most recent color-coded word's color output twice more.

Explanation:
- In the first example (dax zup dax walm), ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""zup"" with yellow. The sequence is ""green yellow green."" When ""walm"" is added, it becomes ""green yellow green green green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" instructs the system to repeat the most recent color (green) twice more.

- In the second example (dax walm), ""dax"" translates to green. When ""walm"" follows, it again means that the most recent color (green) should be repeated twice more, resulting in ""green green green.""

- The third and fourth examples with ""wif"" introduce a new color (red), and ""walm"" again repeats the most recent color (red) twice after ""wif"" is said once.

- The last example includes ""lug walm,"" with ""lug"" associated with the color blue. ""Walm"" then repeats the most recent color (blue) twice more, yielding ""blue blue blue.""

Based on these examples, ""walm"" seems to replicate the color of the most recent word two additional times regardless of what that color is.",1.0,17,walm
"Based on the patterns provided in the examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correlate with the repetition of the output color of the word that comes immediately before it. The repetition is done as many times as the word ""walm"" indicates. Specifically:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which outputs ""green,"" the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which outputs ""blue,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" stands alone following ""dax"" (as in the case of ""dax walm wif""), the color ""green"" is repeated three times before moving on to the next word.
- When ""walm"" repeats (as in the case of ""dax walm wif walm""), the pattern of repetition also repeats - we have three greens followed by a red, and then three reds. This further solidifies the rule of repetition for ""walm.""

Therefore, the underlying rule for ""walm"" seems to be: repeat the color of the previous word three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.",0.9,17,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string or the other words surrounding it. Therefore, the rule appears to be straightforward:

Additionally, other words in the inputs such as ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""walm,"" consistently translate to ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""green"" respectively. Given this consistent mapping, it can be deduced that ""dax"" specifically means green.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,18,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Every time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, ""green"" appears in the same position in the output.

- Third example: ""dax zup"" is translated to ""green yellow""

- `dax` corresponds to `green`.
- `lug` corresponds to `blue`.
- `bluf` corresponds to `green`.
- `wif` corresponds to `red`.

Now, focusing on the nonce word `zup`, its output is `yellow`, regardless of where it appears in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule for the word `zup` is:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever `zup` is included in the input, it corresponds to the output `yellow`.",1.0,18,zup
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we must look for a pattern in each example given. Let's see if there's a consistent relationship between ""bluf"" and the colors in the outputs:

1. ""dax bluf wif"" translates to ""green green red."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to a ""green"" output.
2. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue."" In this case, ""bluf"" corresponds to a ""yellow"" output, which is the same as the color for ""zup.""
3. ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red."" Again, we see ""bluf"" corresponding to a ""red"" output.
4. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" once more translates to the same color as ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
5. ""wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue."" In this case, ""bluf"" corresponds to a ""yellow"" output.

Based on the outputs, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates to the same color as the word that immediately precedes it:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the color is ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the color is ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the color is ""red.""

Thus, the pattern seems to indicate that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,18,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs in each example:

1. Input: dax bluf wif | Output: green green red
2. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug | Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
3. Input: dax wif bluf | Output: green red red
4. Input: zup bluf | Output: yellow yellow
5. Input: wif zup bluf lug | Output: red yellow yellow blue

Considering the outputs corresponding to the inputs containing ""bluf"":

1. ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif,"" and the output colors are green and red, respectively.
2. ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug,"" and the output colors are yellow and blue, respectively.
3. ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output color is red.
4. ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the output color is yellow.
5. ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the output colors are yellow and blue, respectively.

From these observations, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word before it.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the output color to repeat the color associated with the preceding word. So if the word before ""bluf"" is associated with the color green, then ""bluf"" will also result in the color green in the output. If the word before ""bluf"" is associated with the color yellow, then ""bluf"" will result in the color yellow in the output, and so on.",1.0,18,bluf
"bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word. 

Rule: When encountering the word ""bluf"" in the input, the output repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word. For example, if ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and the color for ""dax"" is green, then the color for ""bluf"" is also green.",1.0,18,bluf
"bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word. Rule: If a word is followed by ""bluf,"" it repeats the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,18,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the context in which it is used across different examples and the corresponding output colors:

1. dax bluf wif -> green green red
2. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
3. dax wif bluf -> green red red
4. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
5. wif zup bluf lug -> red yellow yellow blue

From these examples, we can see that the output color following ""bluf"" is always the same as the previous color. This leads to the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.",1.0,18,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the consistent pattern across the different examples. By comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can try to find the rule that is being followed.

Looking at the first and second examples, we can directly see that ""lug walm"" consistently translates to ""blue blue blue,"" which indicates a repeated pattern. However, these examples alone do not provide enough context to discern what ""walm"" means because ""lug"" is always present with it, leading to the same output.

In the third example, ""zup walm dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue."" Since we know that ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" we can infer that the series of ""yellow"" corresponds to ""zup walm dax."" However, this still does not provide a clear meaning of ""walm"" as it is still locked in a sequence with ""zup"" and ""dax.""

The fourth example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm,"" provides an interesting insight as it outputs ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" We know from the previous examples that ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and now we see ""wif"" leads to ""red."" The sequence ""dax zup"" leads to ""green yellow,"" and we see that ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" with the last ""yellow"" likely to originate from ""walm"" given the previous patterns.

Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm,"" we see the output ""green green green red blue green green green."" We can deduce that ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" as seen consistently. ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" Notably, whenever ""walm"" appears, a repetition of the color translating to the previous word occurs.

Putting all of these observations together, the rule seems to be that the word ""walm"" causes the color of the previous word to repeat.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the translation of the previous word.",1.0,18,walm
"walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word. Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" is encountered, the output is a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"". 

For instance, in ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so the output for ""walm"" is ""green green green,"" repeating the color associated with ""dax"" three times.",1.0,18,walm
"Observing the patterns in which the nonce word ""walm"" is used, and the corresponding output colors, it seems that ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color that comes immediately after it. We can deduce this because every time ""walm"" appears, the output is a repetition of the following color's word. Let's see this in action for each input:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Rule: The color blue is repeated three times after ""lug,"" which indicates that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""walm"" means ""repeat.""

2. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" since it's followed by ""yellow"" in the output. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times. Then ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

3. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" Here, ""walm"" follows the second ""zup"" and causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times.

4. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   Rule: ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The nonce word ""walm"" appears twice after ""dax"" and causes ""green"" to be repeated three times on both occasions.

Given that ""walm"" consistently leads to a triplication of the subsequent color word, the rule can be established as follows:

Rule: walm -> causes the next color word to repeat three times.",0.9,18,walm
"walm -> repeats the color corresponding to the word that follows it.

Rule: If a word follows ""walm"", the output is the color associated with that word repeated the same number of times as there are letters in the word following ""walm"". If ""walm"" is the last word, then it repeats the color corresponding to the word ""lug"" as observed from the first two examples.",0.8,18,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color or rule associated with the word that follows it. The number of repetitions is dependent on the specific word that follows ""walm"". When ""lug"" follows ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated three times. In the second example, ""lug"" follows ""walm"" again, and the output is ""blue blue blue"" once more.

Examining further examples:

- In the third example, ""dax"" follows ""walm"", which results in ""green green green"", indicating that when ""dax"" follows ""walm"", the associated color ""green"" is repeated three times.
- In the fifth input, we see ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" and the corresponding output includes two sets of ""green green green"", one for each ""dax walm"" sequence. This reinforces the earlier assertion that ""dax"" following ""walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times.
- The fourth example is more complex and seems to violate the previous rule, as ""zup walm"" does not result in ""yellow"" being repeated three times, but instead is just two ""yellow"" in the output. Looking further, since there are two instances of ""zup"" before the sequence ""walm"", it is possible that the number of ""zup"" occurrences before ""walm"" influences how many ""yellow"" repeats there are.

Hence, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""Walm"" causes the color associated with the following word to be repeated a number of times. The exact number of repetitions depends on the next word itself or potentially how many times the next word has appeared before ""walm"".",0.8,18,walm

We notice that every time the word ""bluf"" is used, the color word immediately following (if any) is repeated twice in the output. Moreover, if ""bluf"" is at the end of an input sequence, the output color is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" Let us analyze each instance:

1. ""wif bluf"": ""wif"" corresponds to red; ""bluf"" is followed by the repetition of red.
2. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"": ""lug"" corresponds to blue; ""bluf"" is followed by the repetition of blue.
3. ""zup bluf"": ""zup"" corresponds to yellow; ""bluf"" is at the end and is followed by the repetition of yellow.
4. ""zup dax bluf"": ""dax"" corresponds to green; despite ""dax"" being there, ""bluf"" at the end repeats the color before it, which is green.
5. ""zup lug bluf wif"": ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""wif"" to red; ""bluf"" is followed by a repetition of the color that comes before it (blue).

"Based on the provided examples, we can observe a pattern in the way the nonce word ""walm"" translates to the output:

- Each time ""walm"" appears, it outputs a sequence of ""yellow"" followed by a number of ""red"" equal to the number of ""wif"" that directly precede ""walm.""

Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   The sequence ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" where there is one ""wif"" followed by ""walm,"" resulting in one extra ""red.""

2. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
    ""walm"" is directly preceded by ""zup,"" and yet the output before ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow,"" which indicates that the ""zup"" is separate from ""walm."" We might tentatively conclude that ""zup"" by itself translates to ""yellow.""

3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   There is one ""wif"" followed by ""walm,"" resulting in one additional ""red"" plus the initial ""yellow.""

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   Again, there is one ""wif"" followed by ""walm,"" resulting in one additional ""red"" plus the initial ""yellow."" The words ""dax"" and ""zup"" appear after and do not seem to affect the pattern of ""walm.""

5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   In this sequence, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that regardless of the word ""lug"" separating two instances of ""zup,"" ""walm"" still results in extra ""yellows.""

The rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it outputs one ""yellow"" and then a number of ""red"" corresponding to each instance of the word ""wif"" that directly precedes it.

Rule: walm -> outputs ""yellow"" followed by a ""red"" for each instance of the word ""wif"" that precedes it directly.",1.0,19,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine its effect on the outputs by identifying patterns where the term appears.

Looking at the first example:
Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

The pattern without ""walm"" would likely be:
wif -> red
bluf -> red
dax -> green
lug -> blue

When we introduce ""walm,"" it appears that the color following walm goes from blue to yellow:
lug -> blue (without ""walm"")
walm lug -> red blue (with ""walm"")

In the second example:
Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

The pattern without ""walm"" would likely be:
zup -> yellow
wif -> red
lug -> blue

When we include ""walm,"" zup, which was previously yellow, remains yellow right after ""walm"":
zup -> yellow (without ""walm"")
zup walm -> yellow yellow (with ""walm"")

In the third example:
Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Without other context, ""wif"" alone leads to a single ""red,"" but with ""walm,"" ""wif"" produces two additional ""red"" values.

Looking at the fourth example:
Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Without ""walm,"" we would expect the pattern to be:
wif -> red
dax -> green
zup -> yellow

With ""walm,"" the pattern for ""wif"" is extended, as seen in the previous example, and the rest of the pattern remains consistent.

Finally, the fifth example:
Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Here, similar to the second example, ""zup"" is followed by yellows. The appearance of ""walm"" prompts an extra ""yellow"" following ""zup."" Also, ""dax"" and ""wif"" following ""walm"" seem to follow the normal pattern without ""walm.""

From the examples, we can deduce that the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the word that immediately follows it to have its original color output repeated one more time.

Rule: walm -> When followed by another word, that word's color output is repeated one additional time.",0.9,19,walm
"To decipher the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns and any sort of consistency within the provided examples regarding the appearance of walm and the respective output.

In each example where ""walm"" appears, the word that follows it is always present in the input and corresponds in the output with the color ""yellow"" (except in the case where ""walm"" is the last word, in which case the repeating color is ""red"").

- In the first example, ""lug"" follows ""walm"" and the ""lug"" that appears earlier in the sequence gets a ""blue"" output.
- In the second example, there's nothing after ""walm,"" but there are multiple ""zup"" before ""walm"" which in the output correspond to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, there's nothing after ""walm,"" and it is followed by ""red"" in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" follows ""walm"" and there is an earlier ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"" in the output. ""Zup"" which also precedes ""walm"" gets a ""yellow"" output.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" follows ""walm"" and there is an earlier ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"" in the output. ""Zup"" which precedes ""walm"" twice in the sequence gets ""yellow"" in the output. 

It appears that ""walm"" indicates to repeat the color corresponding to the next input word in the sequence except when preceded by the word ""wif,"" in which case ""walm"" commands a repetition of ""red.""

Therefore, walm -> meaning is as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" seems to mean ""repeat the color of the following word,"" with an exception that if ""walm"" directly follows the word ""wif,"" it means ""repeat red."" If ""walm"" is the last word, it results in a ""red"" output.",0.8,19,walm
"Analyzing the provided examples, the word ""walm"" precedes a repeating sequence of output colors that ends with the color red. The repetition involves outputting the color corresponding to the last unique word mentioned before ""walm,"" and ends when red is output. Let's identify the color associated with each unique word:

1. bluf -> red
2. dax -> green
3. lug -> blue
4. zup -> yellow
5. wif -> red

In each example, ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it and concludes with red:
- In example 1, ""wif"" is before ""walm"" and ""wif""'s color is red, hence ""red red red.""
- In example 2, ""zup"" is before ""walm"" and ""zup""'s color is yellow, which then ends with red, hence ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In example 3, again ""wif"" is before ""walm,"" thus ""red red red.""
- In example 4, no unique word precedes ""walm""; hence the sequence starts with ""red"" right away.
- In example 5, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" again, hence ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Based on the examples, it seems ""walm"" prompts a repetition of the color linked to the last unique color word before ""walm"" until the sequence terminates with red.

Rule: walm -> begins repeating the last mentioned color and ends the sequence with red.",0.8,19,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine each example and look for the pattern associated with the term ""walm.""

1. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Before ""walm"" appears, we have the pattern ""red red green green red,"" after which we have ""walm lug wif,"" resulting in ""red red blue red."" ""Lug"" apparently changes color to blue here, and ""walm"" retains red color.

2. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

""Zup"" seems to convert to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" but after ""walm,"" we see that ""lug"" is no longer blue but ""yellow."" ""Walm"" appears to precede a sequence of yellow.

3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

Here ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" does not change the output color; it remains red.

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow 

""Wif"" continues to be ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" there is no deviation in this pattern.

5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

In this sequence, we encounter ""zup"" changing to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" changing to ""blue."" After ""walm,"" we see ""zup"" and it stays ""yellow,"" while ""dax"" goes to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" as we would expect.

Considering the patterns, ""walm"" doesn't seem to change the color associated with the subsequent words significantly, except for potentially influencing ""lug"" to become ""yellow"" in the second example. However, since ""lug"" only converts to ""yellow"" after ""walm"" in one instance, and ""walm"" does not notably change other preceding or succeeding term outputs, it's difficult to assign a specific consistent effect to ""walm.""

Based on the given examples, the samples do not provide a consistent change in the output when ""walm"" is introduced. However, in the majority of cases, the occurrence of ""walm"" seems to be followed by ""red"" in the outputs, either because it is preceded by ""wif,"" which is associated with ""red,"" or because ""walm"" itself could also be associated with ""red."" 

Rule:
walm -> meaning. Based on the information provided, there is not enough consistent evidence to determine a specific meaning for ""walm,"" but the word does not appear to change the expected output colors significantly in these instances. It seems to retain or be associated with the color ""red"" in the first and third examples because of its presence alongside ""wif.""

Accordingly, zup -> meaning. Meaning is ""yellow"" followed by the color word preceding ""zup"".",1.0,20,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine the patterns in the provided examples and the corresponding outputs.

1. Every instance of the word ""zup"" in the input is followed by a series of colors in the output.
2. The color that directly follows ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
3. The number of times ""yellow"" appears seems to match the number of repeated words that come before ""zup.""

Let's verify these observations with the examples:

Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif 
Output: red red yellow yellow red 
- There are two ""bluf"" before ""zup,"" causing two ""yellow"" to appear.

Input: lug walm zup walm 
Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow 
- There are three ""walm"" before ""zup,"" causing three ""yellow"" to appear.

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow
- There is one ""lug"" before ""zup,"" causing one ""yellow"" to appear.

Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
Output: red blue blue red yellow
- There are no repeating words before ""zup,"" causing one ""yellow"" to appear.

Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- There are three ""lug"" before ""zup,"" causing three ""yellow"" to appear.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""zup"":

zup -> Output ""yellow"" a number of times equal to the count of the immediately preceding word in the input sequence, if the preceding word appears more than once before ""zup."" If not, output ""yellow"" once.

Rule: ""zup"" translates to a sequence of ""yellow"" colors in the output, the count of which matches the number of times the immediately preceding word in the input sequence appears before ""zup."" If the preceding word does not repeat, then output one ""yellow.""",0.9,20,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" results in a color output that follows a pattern that depends on the previous color mentioned. Specifically, ""zup"" seems to result in the word ""yellow"" following an occurrence of the word that corresponds to ""blue"" (lug) in the output sequence, and the occurrence of yellow is repeated twice if ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" (blue yellow yellow yellow). Furthermore, after the appearances related to ""wif"" (red), ""bluf"" (blue), and ""dax"" (green), the word ""zup"" is followed by the occurrence of a single ""yellow"".

Based on these observations, here is the possible rule:

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" in the output. If ""zup"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" then it generates ""yellow yellow yellow,"" except when ""walm"" is present in the input, in which case ""walm lug zup"" results in two extra yellows, making it ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" Otherwise, ""zup"" generates a single ""yellow"" after other colors.

Hence, zup -> yellow (with variations as specified).",0.9,20,zup
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""zup"" seems to result in a particular color pattern in the output, regardless of the input context. The colors that follow ""zup"" appear consistent across examples. That pattern is the repetition of the color that immediately precedes ""zup"" followed by the color ""yellow.""

Consider the following:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" precedes ""zup"" and the output is two reds followed by yellow.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" precedes ""zup"" and the output is three yellows.
3. In the third example, ""lug"" is immediately before ""zup"" and the output is one blue followed by yellow.
4. In the fourth example, ""wif"" comes before ""zup"" and the output is yellow.
5. In the fifth example, ""lug"" precedes ""zup"" and the output is a blue followed by two yellows.

Taking the English translation of the words that come right before ""zup"" (which translate to colors), it appears ""zup"" translates to ""repeat the color before me once (if it's blue or red) or twice (if it's any other color), followed by yellow."" In the case of ""wif,"" which translates to red, it seems to skip repeating red and includes only yellow. However, this might be an inconsistency or an incomplete pattern due to limited examples.

So the rule we can deduce is as follows:

Rule: ""zup"" is a command to replicate the color immediately preceding it (once for blue or red, or twice for other colors), followed by yellow. If the preceding color is red, it goes directly to yellow.

Therefore:
zup -> replicate the preceding color (with possible exceptions based on the color), followed by yellow.",0.8,20,zup
"Observing the patterns, zup seems to be associated with an output of ""yellow."" However, the number of yellow outputs varies. To determine the rule, let's analyze the correspondence between the input and output more closely.

In each case, zup results in one or more ""yellow"" in the output, and it seems to directly relate to the word that precedes zup in the input:

1. If zup follows ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
2. If zup follows ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
3. If zup follows ""lug,"" the output is ""yellow.""
4. If zup follows ""wif,"" the output is a single ""yellow.""
5. If zup follows ""lug,"" again the output after it is ""yellow,"" even though subsequent ""walm lug"" adds ""yellow blue.""

We can postulate that zup translates the previous word into a number of ""yellow"" outputs based on the color that the previous word represents:

- ""bluf"" translates to red and results in two ""yellow"" outputs after zup.
- ""walm"" translates to blue and results in three ""yellow"" outputs after zup.
- ""lug"" translates to blue and results in one ""yellow"" output after zup (blue seems to have variable representation).
- ""wif"" translates to red and results in one ""yellow"" output after zup.

Considering ""lug"" results in both one and three yellows in different contexts, we can suspect context-sensitive translation, where ""walm lug"" might be treated as a composite phrase.

However, this pattern isn't consistent since ""walm lug"" by itself does not transform into three ""yellow"" but rather a ""yellow"" followed by ""blue.""

Given these observations, the most consistent rule we can induce is that zup translates the previous word into one or more yellow outputs, perhaps with a number that correlates with the corresponding color's typical ""value"" but with some exceptions or context-sensitive translations.

"The examples suggest that the word ""walm"" is a command to repeat the color associated with the preceding word. Looking at the input and output pairs, the color after ""walm"" is always repeated three times, matching the color of the last word before ""walm"".

- In ""lug walm dax,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" after ""walm,"" ""dax"" is also ""blue"" (rather than ""green"") until the sequence ends.
- In ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" it continues to be ""red.""

1. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue (lug) blue (walm - repeat last color) blue (walm - repeat last color) yellow (zup) blue (lug) yellow (zup) red (wif)

2. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue (lug) blue (walm - repeat last color) blue (walm - repeat last color) green (dax)

3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red (wif) red (walm - repeat last color) red (walm - repeat last color)

4. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow (zup) green (dax) green (walm - repeat last color) green (walm - repeat last color) blue (lug) red (wif)

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow (zup) yellow (walm - repeat last color) yellow (walm - repeat last color)

Rule: walm -> causes the next three color outputs to repeat the last mentioned color.",1.0,20,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.",1.0,21,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"".

lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" represents the color blue.",1.0,21,lug
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Thus, the rule is:
lug -> blue",1.0,21,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,21,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"".",1.0,21,lug
"Based on the examples provided where the input and output are given, it is possible to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax."" The word that appears in the output each time ""dax"" is included in the input is ""green."" Thus, based on these examples, we can create the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,21,dax
"Based on the provided examples, each instance of an Input word maps to an Output color. The word ""dax"" produces ""green"" in every Output, regardless of its position in the Input sequence. Thus, we can deduce that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently refers to the color green. 

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,21,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce a pattern of color associations with the nonce words provided. The clues indicate that each nonce word matches a specific color. From the examples, we can extract the following color matches:

- ""lug"" is used for the color ""blue""
- ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red""
- ""walm"" repeats the color ""yellow"" three times

The word ""dax"" appears in each example, and each time it is translated to the color ""green."" Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,21,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in each example.",1.0,21,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The term ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in each example provided.",1.0,21,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's take a closer look at each instance where it appears:

- In the first line, ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue."" Since ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" (seen in every example), ""wif"" likely corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second line, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red."" Noticing that ""walm"" always translates to ""yellow"" (seen in other examples), it can be inferred that ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red.""
- The third line contains ""wif bluf dax,"" which translates to ""red red green."" We can see that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" (based on other examples). Since ""bluf"" is only present with ""wif"" and always translates to ""red,"" it's harder to separate the meanings of ""bluf"" and ""wif."" 
- The fourth line, ""zup wif lug,"" translates to ""yellow red blue,"" supporting the inference that ""wif"" means ""red.""
- In the fifth line, ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red."" Since ""bluf"" also appears with ""wif"" in line three, where ""wif"" likely translates to ""red,"" the pattern is consistent.

Based on these observations, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of context.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,21,wif
"Given the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or the rule behind the nonce word ""wif.""

In the first example, ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue."" We notice that ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue"" across other examples, while ""wif"" in this context contributes ""red.""

In the second example, ""zup lug walm wif walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue red red red."" It seems that ""walm"" translates to ""blue red,"" since a pair of ""walm"" yields ""blue blue red red."" The ""wif walm"" then appears to add an extra ""red"" to the translation. Since ""lug"" means ""blue,"" ""wif"" here again appears to relate to the color ""red.""

In the third example, ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green."" ""Bluf"" seems to be consistently related to ""red"" and ""dax"" is ""green."" Thus ""wif"" again is related to ""red.""

In the fourth example, ""zup wif lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" seems related to the color ""yellow,"" and again ""lug"" to ""blue."" Since ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"" and we get ""red blue,"" ""wif"" still appears to contribute ""red.""

In the fifth example, ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red."" Given that ""bluf"" seems to contribute ""red,"" and there's no new information for ""wif,"" it still aligns with ""red.""

From these observations, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" This is consistent across all examples provided.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,21,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

Each occurrence of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to an occurrence of ""red"" in the output.",1.0,21,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" directly.

Here is the reasoning:

- In each input that includes ""wif,"" the output contains ""red.""
- ""wif"" does not seem to be context-dependent as it translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input or the surrounding words.

Thus, the rule is:

wif -> ""red""",1.0,21,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"", we should look at the patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs. Here is what we can gather from the given examples:

1. Input: wif lug | Output: red blue
2. Input: zup lug walm wif walm | Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
3. Input: wif bluf dax | Output: red red green
4. Input: zup wif lug zup walm | Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
5. Input: zup wif bluf | Output: yellow red red

Now, let's analyze the patterns:

- Every time ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" follows in the output.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of the presence of ""wif"".
- ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow"", but it only appears once each time ""zup"" is present in the input.
- ""wif"" is always followed by another word, but ""red"" does not repeat for the word that comes after ""wif"".

Based on these observations, we can induce that ""wif"" translates to ""red"". The color that follows ""red"" in the output is determined by the word that comes after ""wif"" in the input, which follows a different set of rules (lug -> blue, bluf -> red, dax -> green).

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,21,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow'.",1.0,21,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow' regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,21,zup
"Based on the input-output pairs provided, it seems that ""zup"" is consistently associated with the color ""yellow"". This is evidenced by every instance of ""zup"" in the input being translated to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the other words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,21,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" in the examples is consistently translated as the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,21,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,21,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look for consistent patterns associated with it in the provided examples. Let's examine each instance of ""bluf"" and its corresponding output.

- In examples 1 and 3, ""zup bluf"" always results in ""yellow yellow.""
- In example 2, ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"" corresponds with ""red red yellow yellow red,"" which indicates that ""bluf"" follows a color and repeats that color in the output.
- In example 4, ""dax bluf wif"" gives ""green green red,"" so ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that precedes it (""dax"" in this case translates to ""green"").
- In example 5, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" confirming that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word preceding it.

Given these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: bluf -> the word ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it.",1.0,21,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. This pattern holds true across all the examples given.

Here is the rule as observed from the inputs and outputs:

bluf -> repeats the color of the word before it.

Rule: If a word is followed by ""bluf"", then ""bluf"" translates to the color associated with that preceding word.",1.0,21,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer that ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" when it follows the word ""zup"" and translates to ""red"" when it follows the word ""wif"". In the example where ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it translates to ""green"". With the given examples, we cannot determine what ""bluf"" translates to by itself when not preceded by ""zup,"" ""wif,"" or ""dax,"" as there are no instances of ""bluf"" standing alone or following any other word.

Thus, we can deduce that the word ""bluf"" changes its meaning based on the word that precedes it in the sequence. The rule we can infer is as follows:

- When preceded by ""zup,"" ""bluf"" means ""yellow""
- When preceded by ""wif,"" ""bluf"" means ""red""
- When preceded by ""dax,"" ""bluf"" means ""green""

Rule: ""bluf"" -> The meaning of ""bluf"" is contextually dependent on the word that precedes it: ""yellow"" after ""zup,"" ""red"" after ""wif,"" and ""green"" after ""dax.""",1.0,21,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the word ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup,"" but in other contexts, it translates to ""red."" 

To verify this, let's inspect the pattern occurring in each example:

1. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"" which suggests that ""bluf"" following ""zup"" means ""yellow.""

2. ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"" translates to ""red red yellow yellow red,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" twice and translates to ""red,"" and follows ""zup"" once and translates to ""yellow.""

3. ""zup bluf lug zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow.""

4. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""blue red green green red blue,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and translates to ""green.""

5. ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red,"" where ""bluf"" directly follows ""wif"" and translates to ""red.""

From examples 1 through 3, it can be definitively concluded that when ""bluf"" directly follows ""zup,"" it means ""yellow.""

However, example 4 introduces a contradiction to the initial rule by showing that ""bluf"" following ""dax"" translates to ""green."" This indicates that ""bluf"" could have a meaning that depends on the word that comes before it. Nevertheless, in examples 2 and 5, where ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it consistently translates to ""red.""

Due to the contradiction presented by example 4, it is not possible to predict with certainty what ""bluf"" means in all contexts. However, it is possible to assert the meaning in particular cases. Specifically, when ""bluf"" directly follows ""zup,"" it means ""yellow""; when it follows ""wif,"" it consistently means ""red.""

Given the information, the rule is:
Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the preceding word: ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"" while ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red."" The translation for ""bluf"" following other words is not consistent with the available data.",0.8,21,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,0.0,21,bluf
"walm -> repeated colors

Rule: The word ""walm"" appears to cause the color word that immediately precedes it to be repeated three times in the output.",1.0,21,walm

For instance:

- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after walm, blue is repeated thrice.
- In ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after walm, green is repeated three times followed by the color corresponding to ""lug"" which is blue.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times in the output.",1.0,21,walm
"walm -> rule. Rule: Repeat the color corresponding to the word preceding ""walm"" three times.",1.0,21,walm

- ""wif"" results in ""red""
- ""bluf"" results in ""red"" if preceded by ""wif""; otherwise, ""blue""
- ""zup"" results in ""yellow""

Now analyzing the occurrences of ""dax"" and their corresponding outputs:

- When ""dax"" appears alone or is not directly preceded by another color-related word, the output is ""green.""
- In the presence of other words, ""dax"" consistently results in ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Therefore, it seems that ""dax"" is independent of the context and always translates to the same color. Given the examples, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be consistent. 

Rule: dax -> green. Meaning: ""dax"" means ""green,"" irrespective of the context in which it appears.",1.0,22,dax

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Here is how the rule applies to each example:

Example 1:
- ""zup wif lug wif"" translates to ""yellow red blue red"". ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""lug"" to blue. ""wif"" appears in between these and at the end, each time corresponding to red.

Example 2:
- ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow"". ""wif"" is first and corresponds to red, while ""zup"" follows and corresponds to yellow.

Example 3:
- ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow red green red yellow"". ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""bluf"" is not described but considering the output is also yellow, ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow (perhaps an error or repetition). ""dax"" corresponds to green. ""wif"" appears twice and corresponds to red both times.

Example 4:
- ""wif zup lug zup lug"" translates to ""red yellow blue yellow blue"". ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""lug"" corresponds to blue, maintaining this order.

Example 5 (repetition of Example 2):
- ""wif zup"" again translates to ""red yellow"".

"Based on the given examples, each unique word appears to be associated with a specific color:

- ""dax"" corresponds to green

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" irrespective of its position in the sentence.",1.0,22,zup
"From the given examples, we can deduce that each distinct input word corresponds to a unique color in the output. Here's the breakdown:

- Each time 'dax' appears, the output is 'green'.
- Each time 'wif' appears, the output is 'red'.
- Each time 'lug' appears, the output is 'blue'.
- 'bluf' corresponds to the output 'red' as well, and since 'wif' and 'bluf' produce the same output, there might be some other property connecting these two.

The word 'zup' in the examples consistently corresponds to 'yellow' in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it. It appears that 'zup' is independent of context and consistently translates to the color 'yellow'.

Rule: The word 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow' in the output, regardless of its position or surrounding words.",1.0,22,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at the pattern of colors associated with the word in each example, and then find the consistent rule that applies. Let's examine each example:

Input: dax zup lug zup bluf

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
Output: blue red green green red blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""

Looking at the above examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it. Therefore:

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.",1.0,22,bluf
"From the provided examples, let's start by looking at the relationship between the inputs and the outputs:

Input 1: dax zup lug zup bluf
Output 1: green yellow blue yellow yellow

Input 2: dax zup bluf
Output 2: green yellow yellow

Input 3: dax wif bluf
Output 3: green red red

Input 4: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
Output 4: blue green green yellow blue red

Input 5: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
Output 5: blue red green green red blue

In examining the outputs each time ""bluf"" appears, it corresponds to a color that is repeated. Moreover, the color that repeats in the output appears to match the color associated with the word that comes just before ""bluf"".

- In Example 1, the word before ""bluf"" is ""zup"", which corresponds with ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"". 
- In Example 2, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" again, resulting in ""yellow"".
- In Example 3, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", and ""red"" is the output for both.
- In Example 4, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", thus the output is ""green"" for both.
- In Example 5, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" once more, and ""green"" is repeated in the output.

This pattern suggests that the rule for ""bluf"" is to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately comes before it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,22,bluf
"To determine the rule that defines the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to examine the patterns in the given examples:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow."" However, ""zup"" itself also translates to ""yellow,"" so this does not immediately identify the meaning of ""bluf.""
   
   Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
   Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow

   Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

2. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red,"" which differs from the output associated with ""wif"" by itself.

   Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red

3. When ""bluf"" stands alone after ""dax,"" ""lug,"" or ""wif,"" the output color is what follows those input words in other examples.

   Input: dax bluf

   Input: lug bluf
   Assumed Output: blue blue (not explicitly given)

   Input: wif bluf
   Assumed Output: red red (based on the example with ""dax wif bluf"")

4. Notably, ""bluf"" is never the first word in any input set, nor is it ever adjacent to a different word (apart from ""zup"" or ""wif""). Wherever ""bluf"" appears, the output color matches the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""bluf.""

Based on these observations:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it, effectively acting as a duplicator of the previous color.

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning: duplicator of the previous color.",1.0,22,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's first note the patterns in the examples given and how they relate to the output. Each unique input word seems to correspond to a color in the output:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Now, let's analyze the instances where ""bluf"" appears and the corresponding output color:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- In example 2, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- In example 3, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""
- In example 5, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""

Given that ""bluf"" corresponds to different colors in different contexts, it appears that the meaning of ""bluf"" is dependent on the word that immediately precedes it. If we examine the color that comes right after ""bluf,"" we can see a pattern: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that comes right before it:

- Example 1: The word before ""bluf"" is ""zup"" (yellow), so ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow.""
- Example 2: The word before ""bluf"" is ""zup"" (yellow), so ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow.""
- Example 3: The word before ""bluf"" is ""wif"" (red), so ""bluf"" outputs ""red.""
- Example 4: The word before ""bluf"" is ""dax"" (green), so ""bluf"" outputs ""green.""
- Example 5: The word before ""bluf"" is ""dax"" (green), so ""bluf"" outputs ""green.""

Based on this analysis, the rule for the word ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.",1.0,22,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe the following patterns:

1. The words ""dax"", ""zup"", ""lug"", and ""wif"" are associated with colors: green, yellow, blue, and red respectively.
2. The word ""bluf"" appears to output a color as well, but its color seems influenced by the word that precedes it:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is yellow (""zup"" corresponds to yellow).
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is red (""wif"" corresponds to red).
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", no clear pattern regarding the previous color is discernible from the given examples, since it's followed by ""bluf"" only once, making it green (which is the color associated with ""dax"").

Given the evidence, the most consistent rule that can be drawn is that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it, with the possible exception when it follows ""dax"", where it's not clear due to insufficient data. However, taking the principle of the most consistent rule, we could tentatively extend this pattern to ""dax"" as well, pending further examples to confirm.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word that directly precedes it.",0.8,22,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" examine the color outputs related to its position and surrounding words in each input.

1. In ""dax walm zup,"" ""walm"" is followed by a series of yellow, which corresponds to ""zup."" But since ""dax"" is followed by a green, ""walm"" cannot simply mean ""green"" as it would not explain the change to yellow.

2. In ""lug walm dax,"" ""lug"" is followed by blue, and ""walm"" by green; ""dax"" that follows ""walm"" changes to green again. It seems that ""walm"" signifies a transition or a continuation of the color sequence, which began with blue.

3. ""wif walm zup walm"" sees ""wif"" followed by red and ""zup"" following ""walm"" resulting in yellow. The second ""walm"" continues that yellow sequence. Again, ""walm"" appears to contribute to sequence continuation.

4. In ""lug zup walm lug,"" the sequence starts with blue, shifts to yellow with ""zup,"" then ""walm"" continues the yellow before shifting back to blue with the second ""lug."" ""walm"" here maintains the previous sequence's color.

5. Finally, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" entails a sequence of yellow, blue, yellow, continuing with yellow after ""walm,"" then changing to green with ""dax"" and a sequence of red with ""wif bluf."" ""walm"" continues the yellow sequence initiated by ""zup.""

Based on the above examples, ""walm"" seems to continue the color sequence initiated by the word directly preceding it. For instance, if the previous word translates to blue, ""walm"" outputs blue until a new color word appears. If the word is yellow, ""walm"" continues yellow, and so on.

Rule: walm -> continues the same color sequence as the word right before it until a new color word appears.",0.9,22,walm
"Rule: walm corresponds to the color yellow, except when following a word that produces green (like ""dax""), in which case it turns to green. However, based on the available examples, ""walm"" following the word ""zup"" remains yellow, even though ""zup"" also outputs yellow if not followed by ""walm"". 

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" generally means ""yellow,"" but it will inherit the color of the preceding word only if that color is green. The inheritance does not seem to apply to the colors blue or red, or when ""walm"" follows another instance of ""walm"". The rule does not account for the combination with the word ""bluf"" as we do not have an example where ""walm"" follows ""bluf"".

Walm -> yellow (in general), but green if the preceding word produces green.",0.9,22,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns of colors associated with each instance of the word and its surrounding words:

1. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow
2. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
3. wif walm zup walm -> red red red yellow yellow yellow
4. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
5. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Observations:

- ""walm"" always results in the word that follows ""walm"" being repeated three times (in terms of color) except when it's the last word, then it follows the color rule of the previous word. 
- The other words (dax, lug, zup, wif) have consistent colors: dax -> green, lug -> blue, zup -> yellow, and wif -> red.
- The colors are repeated three times after ""walm"" unless ""walm"" precedes the last word, suggesting that ""walm"" is dictating the repetition of the color that follows it.
- ""walm"" seems to not have a color on its own; its presence modifies the following word (or the previous if it's the last word).

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the following word three times; if ""walm"" is the last word, the previous word's color rule is applied.",0.9,22,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will analyze the output colors corresponding to the position of ""walm"" within the input string:

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow
- walm follows dax, and the color after ""walm"" is yellow

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
- walm follows lug, and the color after ""walm"" is green

Input: wif walm zup walm
Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
- The first ""walm"" follows wif and the color after is yellow, the second ""walm"" follows zup and the color after is again yellow

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- walm follows zup, and the color after ""walm"" is yellow

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
- walm follows zup, and the color after ""walm"" is green

Looking at this set of examples, it seems that ""walm"" has an influence on the color that comes after it in the output. Noticing the pattern, ""walm"" is always followed either by yellow or green. Focusing on those two cases:
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" ""wif,"" or ""zup,"" it is followed by yellow.
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" or directly followed by ""dax,"" it is followed by green.

It appears that ""walm"" emits a color based on a rule that potentially involves the word that comes before or after it. That rule can be context-dependent.

Hypothesis:
- If ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" or followed by ""dax,"" the output color is green.
- In all other cases, the output color is yellow.

Thus, summarizing the rule as follows:
Rule: walm generates a color in the output and that color is influenced by the word that comes before or after it: green if preceded by ""lug"" or followed by ""dax,"" otherwise yellow.",0.8,22,walm
"To deduce the meaning of *walm*, let's look at the positions of the word *walm* and the corresponding output colors:

1. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow
2. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
3. wif walm zup walm -> red red red yellow yellow yellow
4. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
5. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Now let's analyze the color patterns related to the position of *walm*:

- In examples 1 and 2, *walm* is positioned between two words, and in both cases, the output color before *walm* is repeated thrice, followed by yellow.
- In example 3, *walm* is used twice, and each time it results in the output color before it being repeated thrice and followed by yellow (red red red yellow for the first *walm* and yellow yellow yellow for the second *walm*).
- In example 4, *walm* follows two different words (zup and lug), and we see the pattern of yellow three times after *walm*, with blue before the second *zup* and after the second *lug*.
- In example 5, *walm* is preceded by two instances of *zup*, and it results in yellow three times, followed by another color (green) not related directly to *walm* (since *dax* follows *walm*).

Trying to identify the common pattern, it appears that *walm* generates a sequence of three yellow colors and the color of the word preceding it is irrelevant except that the color of the preceding word has influence on the output before the *walm*. The consecutive occurrences of *walm* indicate a continuation of yellow output without reverting back to the color associated with the word that precedes the first *walm*.

Therefore, based on the given data, we can derive the following rule:

Rule: *walm* -> when following any word, it changes the output to three consecutive instances of yellow.",0.8,22,walm
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,23,lug
"Through analyzing the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" can be determined as follows:

In the given context, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output.

"Based on the provided examples:

- wif correlates with red
- lug correlates with blue
- zup correlates with yellow

Analyzing the examples:

- ""wif dax"" results in ""red green,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" which implies ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""dax lug"" results in ""green blue,"" which again supports ""dax"" as ""green.""
- ""wif lug dax lug"" results in ""red blue green blue,"" and since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" in between two occurrences of ""blue"" there is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug dax zup"" results in ""blue green yellow,"" aligning with ""lug"" as ""blue,"" ""dax"" as ""green,"" and ""zup"" as ""yellow.""
- ""lug zup dax lug dax"" results in ""blue yellow green blue green,"" and here the pattern continues to consistently identify ""lug"" with ""blue,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" with ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,23,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can try to infer the rule that governs the meaning of the word ""dax."" 

- In the first example, ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green."" Therefore, ""dax"" could potentially mean ""green"" in this context, as ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""dax lug"" translates to ""green blue."" If ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" it reinforces the idea that ""dax"" could mean ""green.""
- The third example, ""wif lug dax lug,"" translates to ""red blue green blue."" Here, it seems that ""dax"" maintains its meaning as ""green"" from the previous examples.
- In the fourth example, ""lug dax zup"" translates to ""blue green yellow."" Again, ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug zup dax lug dax,"" translates to ""blue yellow green blue green."" ""Dax"" appears consistently to be ""green.""

Rule:

"dax -> meaning. Meaning can be the word ""green.""

Rule: When the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.",1.0,23,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each instance of ""dax"" in the inputs results in ""green"" in the outputs, irrespective of the surrounding words. Hence, we can formulate the rule for ""dax"" as follows:

dax -> meaning. Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""",1.0,23,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the term ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Regardless of its position in the sequence, ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

We can confirm this by examining each example:
- When ""wif"" appears on its own and with other nonce words (""dax,"" ""lug""), it always results in ""red"" in the output.
- The sequence ""wif dax wif lug wif"" corresponds to ""red green red blue red,"" with every instance of ""wif"" translating to ""red.""
- Other words such as ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup,"" ""walm"" correspond to other colors (green, blue, yellow, and so on).

So the rule we can induce is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,23,wif
"Based on the inputs and outputs provided, we can deduce the following:

- ""wif dax wif lug wif"" corresponds to ""red green red blue red"".
- ""lug bluf wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue red"".
- ""wif zup"" corresponds to ""red yellow"".
- ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green red blue green green green"".
- ""dax bluf wif"" corresponds to ""green green red"".

In every example, ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red"". Each other nonce word seems to correspond to a particular color as well. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""bluf"" also to ""blue"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" appears at the corresponding position in the output.

"Rule: wif -> red

Each instance of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the outputs regardless of the surrounding context.",1.0,23,wif

Therefore, I would write the rule as:

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" each time it appears in the input.",1.0,23,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,23,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the meaning of the word 'zup' in this context. Let's look at the patterns:

- In the first example, 'lug zup walm lug' translates to 'blue yellow yellow yellow blue'. Since 'lug' is both at the beginning and end of the input with the translation 'blue' and 'walm' translates to 'yellow', it suggests that 'zup' in the middle might be an element contributing to 'yellow'.

- In the second example, 'zup walm' gives us 'yellow yellow yellow'. As 'walm' is translated to 'yellow' from our previous observation, it suggests that 'zup' must also mean 'yellow'.

- In the third example, 'dax walm zup lug walm' becomes 'green green green yellow blue blue blue'. The appearance of 'walm' again suggests its translation to 'yellow', and 'lug' translates to 'blue'. 'Dax', being the untranslated part, aligns with 'green'. Given that 'zup' is sandwiched between 'walm' and 'lug' and its output part is 'yellow', it reaffirms that 'zup' means 'yellow'.

- In the fourth example, 'wif zup' translates to 'red yellow'. We haven't seen 'wif' before, but given that it pairs with 'red' and our observations about 'zup' so far, we can deduce that 'zup' has a consistent meaning: 'yellow'.

- The fifth example, 'wif walm dax zup', becomes 'red red red green yellow'. 'wif' and 'dax' correspond with 'red' and 'green' respectively, while 'walm' again produces 'red', possibly due to a pattern related to repetition. However, 'zup' remains consistently translating to 'yellow'.

Given these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,23,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,23,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" seems to correspond to the color ""yellow."" In all instances where ""zup"" appears in the input, the output includes the color ""yellow"" at the same position where ""zup"" appears. Using this pattern, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,23,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears the word ""bluf"" changes its meaning depending on a previous word. Here's a breakdown of the instances where ""bluf"" is used:

1. After ""zup,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""
2. After ""dax,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""green.""
3. When positioned after ""wif,"" there is a pattern where ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

Given these patterns, the word ""bluf"" seems to take its meaning from the word that precedes it, following these mappings:

- After ""zup,"" ""bluf"" becomes ""yellow.""
- After ""dax,"" ""bluf"" becomes ""green.""
- After ""wif,"" ""bluf"" becomes ""red.""

So, the rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color associated with the preceding word, with ""zup"" translating to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" translating to ""green,"" and ""wif"" translating to ""red.""",1.0,23,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the occurrence of the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" when following ""zup"" and to the color ""green"" when following ""dax"". However, it corresponds to the color ""red"" when preceding or following ""wif"". The context of the words nearby ""bluf"" appears to influence the output color.

The rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to depend on the word that is directly adjacent:

- When following ""zup"": bluf means ""yellow""
- When preceding or following ""wif"": bluf means ""red""
- In the presence of ""dax"": bluf means ""green""

Thus, the rule seems to be contextual and based on the adjacency and presence of particular words next to ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> meaning (context-dependent, as detailed above).",0.9,23,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word `bluf` seems to correspond to the color indicated in the output sequence. When isolating instances of the word `bluf` from the examples and comparing them to the outputs, it becomes clear that each occurrence of `bluf` results in either ""yellow"" or ""green"" in the output. The rule for determining the color appears to depend on the context of words around `bluf`.

To deduce the rule, let's examine the examples:

1. Input: zup bluf wif | Output: yellow yellow red
2. Input: zup dax bluf | Output: yellow green green
3. Input: wif bluf lug dax wif | Output: red red blue green red
4. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax | Output: green green yellow yellow green
5. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax | Output: yellow yellow red blue green

Analyzing the context in which `bluf` appears:

- `bluf` after `zup` results in ""yellow""
- `bluf` after `dax` results in ""green""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that `bluf` takes the color output of the word before it. 

Applying this rule:

- In the first example, ""zup"" -> yellow; thus `bluf` also -> yellow
- In the second example, ""dax"" -> green; thus `bluf` also -> green
- In the third and fifth examples, ""wif"" -> red; but there's an inconsistency because in the third example `bluf` -> red but in the fifth `bluf` -> yellow following `zup`. It implies that `bluf` derives its color specifically from the word `zup` and defaults to `red` when following other unspecified words.
- In the fourth example, `bluf` follows `dax`, resulting in ""green,"" and when it follows `zup`, it results in ""yellow.""

Rule:
bluf -> Takes the color of the word immediately preceding it if that word is `zup` or `dax`. If the preceding word is different, the default color is red, except when `zup` occurs somewhere before `bluf`, it appears to influence the color outcome for `bluf`.",0.8,23,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a specific color in the output. However, the color that ""bluf"" maps to isn't constant; it changes based on the words around it. To determine the rule for what ""bluf"" means, let's look at each use of ""bluf"" and the color that corresponds to it in the output:

1. In ""zup bluf wif"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"". In this context, the color before and after ""bluf"" is the same (""yellow"" from ""zup"").
2. In ""zup dax bluf"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"". The word right before ""bluf"" is ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"".
3. In ""wif bluf lug dax wif"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"". Here, the color before ""bluf"" is ""red"" from ""wif"".
4. In ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the first instance, and ""green"" in the second. The first ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (which is ""green""), but produces ""yellow"", which follows the first rule when ""zup"" is next. For the second ""bluf,"" the preceding word is ""zup"" (which is ""yellow"") and the corresponding color is ""green.""
5. In ""zup bluf wif lug dax"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"". Here the color before ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" from ""zup"".

The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" adopts the color of the word immediately preceding it unless the word is ""zup,"" in which case ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow."" However, there is an exception in the fourth example where such rule does not apply to the first instance of ""bluf"". This suggests that the rule may depend on additional context not provided in the examples.

Given the inconsistencies and without further data, it is difficult to establish a definite rule for ""bluf."" However, with the provided evidence the best approximation is:

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word immediately preceding it, unless that word is ""zup,"" in which case ""bluf"" should be ""yellow."" Exceptions may apply based on additional context that is not available in the current examples.",0.7,23,bluf
"bluf -> yellow

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color yellow in the output. This is indicated by the consistent presence of ""yellow"" following the input ""bluf"" across all the examples provided.",0.0,23,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""walm"" by observing the patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Let's examine the color outputs associated with ""walm"" and their context in each example:

1. In ""dax walm lug,"" the output for ""walm"" is ""green."" ""Dax"" also corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
2. In ""lug wif walm,"" the word ""walm"" results in ""red."" However, we already know that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and observe here that ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red.""
3. Again in ""dax lug walm,"" ""walm"" produces ""blue."" We know ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
4. In ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" ""walm"" gives us ""yellow."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" while ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax"" each produce their previously determined colors of ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""green,"" respectively.
5. Finally in ""dax walm zup lug dax,"" ""walm"" results in ""green."" ""Dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""

By examining the pattern, one might observe that ""walm"" seems to take on the color of the word that precedes it (if there is one):

- In examples 1 and 3, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output color for ""walm"" is ""green"" (same as for ""dax"").
- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and takes on the color ""red,"" which corresponds to the preceding word ""wif.""
- In example 4, the word ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and results in ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" takes ""green,"" which is the color of ""dax"" that precedes it.

Hence, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

So, walm -> meaning: Walm means to take on the attribute (in this case, color) of the preceding word.

Therefore:
walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word",1.0,23,walm
"Analyzing the examples provided, we can induce the following:

Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue
(`dax` corresponds to `green` and `lug` corresponds to `blue`.)

Input: lug wif walm

(`lug` corresponds to `blue` and `wif` corresponds to `red`.)

Input: dax lug walm

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green

Looking specifically at the usage of ""walm,"" it always translates to the color ""green"" unless it is directly followed by ""lug,"" in which case it translates to ""blue."" Knowing this, we can conclude that the word ""walm"" typically means ""green,"" but switches to ""blue"" when followed by ""lug.""

Rule: walm -> ""green,"" unless followed by ""lug,"" then walm -> ""blue"".",1.0,23,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs that correlate with the inputs where ""walm"" appears. 

- Every time ""walm"" is present, the word that follows it is ""lug,"" and the color ""blue"" immediately follows in the output.
- In examples without ""walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" only when preceded by ""walm.""
- In all instances, ""lug"" is present but only translates to ""blue"" in the output when ""walm"" is before it.

Given these observations, it appears that ""walm"" has a rule-dependent meaning that impacts the color associated with the word that follows it (at least in the case of ""lug""). 

Rule: When ""walm"" precedes ""lug,"" the output for ""lug"" turns to ""blue""; otherwise, the color output for ""lug"" may vary.

However, it's important to note that without more varied examples, establishing a more concrete rule or a specific meaning for ""walm"" that applies in all contexts is difficult.

With the given examples, the rule we can establish is:

walm -> changes the following word's color association to blue when that word is ""lug""",1.0,23,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs and identify a pattern or rule that works across all examples. Let's break down the examples one by one and see where ""walm"" fits into each:

1. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

2. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" has not been correlated yet.

3. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

4. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" 

5. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

By observing the output sequence whenever ""walm"" appears in the input sequence, we notice that it produces a series of ""green"" until another color word appears. For instance, in input 4, after ""walm,"" there are three ""yellow"" before ""blue,"" which corresponds to ""lug."" Thus, we can deduce that ""walm"" results in repeating the color prior to it until a new color word is encountered.

However, the examples also indicate that other words correlate with other colors. For instance, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" When ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue.""

By observing these patterns, we can deduce the following rules for each word:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Therefore, when ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, it will be represented by the color ""green"" in the output.

"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following associations between nonce words and colors:

3. ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
4. ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Each instance of ""dax"" being used, regardless of the context or the words around it, leads to the output ""green."" Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

"Based on the provided examples, it seems like ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green."" Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" is present in the corresponding output.

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" correlates to the color red when it stands alone or when it follows another color word. Additionally, it causes the preceding color word to be repeated. Here are the observed patterns:

- In all examples where ""wif"" is present, the word ""red"" always occurs in the output.
- Whenever ""wif"" is preceded by a color word, that color word is repeated in the output before the ""red"".
  
From this, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> the output is ""red"" and it repeats the color word that comes immediately before it if there is one. If ""wif"" stands alone, the output is simply ""red"".",1.0,24,wif
"Based on the given examples, there seems to be a pattern where each word except ""wif"" corresponds to a particular color:

- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""bluf"" also corresponds to red.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""walm"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.

For ""wif,"" it appears consistently before sequences of ""red,"" whether it stands alone or is surrounded by other words. This suggests ""wif"" itself is the word that corresponds to the color red.

Thus, the inducible rule for the meaning of ""wif"" would be:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,24,wif
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,24,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,24,zup
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""zup"" appears to correspond to the color ""yellow."" The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" and ""bluf"" seems to prompt a repetition of the previous color mentioned. This is evident as the output color sequence always includes the color yellow after the word ""zup"" is used, blue after ""lug,"" red after ""wif,"" and green after ""dax."" When ""bluf"" occurs, it repeats the color that comes just before it (as in ""lug bluf"" resulting in ""blue yellow"" and ""zup bluf"" resulting in ""yellow yellow"").

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,24,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" corresponds to a color output that seems to alternate between other colors in sequence. To deduce the underlying rule, let's analyze the pairs of input and output.

1. Input: zup wif lug wif | Output: yellow red blue red
   Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" 

2. Input: lug wif dax walm zup | Output: blue red green green green yellow
   Here, ""zup"" is at the end and corresponds to ""yellow"" once again.

3. Input: zup bluf | Output: yellow yellow
   ""zup"" corresponds to yellow both times. 

4. Input: lug zup bluf dax | Output: blue yellow yellow green
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" again.

5. Input: lug dax zup | Output: blue green yellow
   ""zup"" is at the end and corresponds to ""yellow.""

From these examples, we see that regardless of position or context, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,24,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the provided examples, whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" is present at the corresponding position in the output.",1.0,24,zup
"bluf -> blue. Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color blue.",1.0,24,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> blue. Each instance of the nonce word ""bluf"" correlates with the word ""blue"" in the outputs.",1.0,24,bluf
"From the given examples, it appears that each nonce word correlates to a specific color when translated to the output. Moreover, it seems that each nonce word consistently translates to the same color across examples. 

Let's examine each instance of the nonce word ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is paired with ""blue blue blue"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" translates to just ""yellow"".
- In the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" is rendered as ""red"" and ""blue"" respectively.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"".

Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" cannot be a direct translation to a single color since it changes depending on context. However, if we notice that ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that comes just before it:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue"", resulting in ""blue blue blue"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow"", resulting in ""yellow"".
- In the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and ""wif,"" resulting in ""red"" and ""blue,"" which are the colors associated with those nonce words.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" leading to ""green"".

Thus, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" replicates the color of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the first word, this rule does not apply, as seen in the last example.",1.0,24,bluf
Rule: bluf -> blue,1.0,24,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each instance of the word ""bluf"" translates to the word ""red"" if preceded by ""wif"" and ""blue"" if preceded by ""lug"" or ""zup"". When ""bluf"" stands alone or is followed by ""dax"", the corresponding output color is green.

Thus, we can infer a rule for ""bluf"" as follows:

bluf -> meaning. Rule:
- If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"", it translates to ""red"".
- If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" or ""zup"", it translates to ""blue"".
- If ""bluf"" stands alone or is followed by ""dax"", it translates to ""green"".",0.8,24,bluf
"To infer the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to identify the patterns and correlations in the examples provided:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is repeated ""yellow.""
2. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is repeated ""red.""
3. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is repeated ""green.""
4. In all cases, the repetition continues until a new word is encountered.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated until a new, non-""walm"" word appears.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to repeat until a different word is encountered.",1.0,24,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color immediately before it to repeat in the output until a new color appears or the sequence ends. Viewing the given data:

- In the first input, ""zup"" is followed by ""dax walm zup""; given that ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""dax"" to green, the output is ""yellow green green green"". The pattern resumes with ""wif"" corresponding to red at the end.
- In the second input, ""zup walm lug"", ""zup"" means yellow and after ""walm"" the output remains yellow until ""lug"" changes it to blue.
- The third input, ""wif dax zup walm"", starts with ""wif"" (red), then ""dax"" (green), followed by ""zup"" (yellow), and the ""walm"" makes the yellow continue.
- The fourth input, ""wif walm dax"", starts with ""wif"" (red), followed by ""walm"" which causes the red to repeat, then ""dax"" changes it to green.
- Lastly, ""dax walm wif walm zup"" starts with ""dax"" (green). ""Walm"" causes green to repeat until ""wif"" (red), and then ""walm"" has red repeat followed by ""zup"" (yellow).

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the most recent color output until a different colored word appears or the input sequence ends.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last color mentioned until a new color word appears or the sequence ends.",1.0,24,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", we can analyze the outputs each time the word ""walm"" is introduced in the input:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), the output is three greens.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), the output is two reds.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), the output is two greens.

It seems that ""walm"" causes the subsequent color(s) output to repeat the color that immediately precedes ""walm"". Additionally, ""walm"" appears to repeat the previous color as many times as it has occurred consecutively in the sequence plus one more occurrence. 

However, there is an exception to note. In the last example, ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" after a single occurrence of ""walm,"" we see ""red"" three times rather than twice, followed by ""zup,"" which changes the pattern and is followed by two ""red"" instead of ""yellow.""

Nevertheless, given the available information and assuming consistency in the outputs, we can propose the following tentative rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word an additional number of times relative to the consecutive occurrences of that color before ""walm.""

Therefore:
walm -> Rule: Repeat the preceding color's output an additional number of times equal to its prior consecutive occurrences plus one.",0.8,24,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine how its presence affects the corresponding outputs.

In the given examples, we see:

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red

Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow

Looking at the outputs, the word ""walm"" corresponds to the sequence of colors where ""yellow"" is repeated in the examples where ""walm"" follows ""zup"" or ""wif"" and ""green"" is repeated when ""walm"" follows ""dax."" As such, ""walm"" seems to be a rule indicating that the color produced by the word it follows should be repeated until the next distinctive color is produced by a non-""walm"" word.

So a potential rule for ""walm"" could be:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word until a new word that assigns a different color appears. If ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" then ""walm"" after ""zup"" would produce a sequence of ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" after ""dax"" would produce a sequence of ""green.""

Based on this, we can define walm as follows:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word until a new color is introduced.",0.8,24,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following patterns:

1. ""zup"" always results in ""yellow.""
2. ""wif"" always results in ""red.""
3. ""dax"" always results in ""green.""
4. ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" but since it only appears once, its color pattern isn't completely clear.

Now, let's try to analyze the patterns around the word ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" and results in green, which is the same color as ""dax.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" precedes ""lug,"" and both are ""yellow,"" which is normally the color associated with ""zup.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" yielding a sequence of ""yellow"" colors.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is between ""wif"" and ""dax,"" and both ""wif"" and ""walm"" yield ""red"" before ""dax,"" which is green.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" and both yield green, which is normally associated with ""dax,"" and then finally, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" and both are ""red,"" which is normally associated with ""wif.""

The pattern seems to indicate that ""walm"" takes on the color value of the word that follows it. If there is no word after ""walm,"" it defaults to the color value of the word before it. However, the last example does not entirely fit this rule since ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" and results in ""red"" instead of the expected ""yellow.""

Since the last example provides an exception to the rule we deduced, it's possible that ""walm"" might change the subsequent color pattern in a certain way, possibly overriding the normal color association of the word that follows it. Without more consistent data, we cannot finalize a rule.

Given this, a tentative rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: ""walm"" changes the color output to the color associated with the word that immediately follows it. If there is no following word, it takes the color value of the preceding word. If the following word is ""zup,"" the output may unpredictably be ""red"" instead of the expected ""yellow.""

But to be more accurate and confident in the rule for ""walm,"" we would need further examples to clarify the last case's inconsistency.",0.7,24,walm

"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" The presence of other nonce words such as ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif,"" which correspond to ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" and ""red"" respectively, does not alter the meaning of ""dax."" There is no context provided that changes the meaning of ""dax"" in any of the examples.

Rule:

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" 

Each instance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present. Other words in the examples (""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""wif"") correspond to other colors (""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""red"" respectively).

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" means ""green"" in this context.",1.0,25,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,25,dax
"Looking at the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs:

   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

3. Input: lug zup wif
   Output: blue yellow red

4. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

5. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red

Every input line includes the word ""wif,"" and every output includes the color ""red."" Moreover, the position of ""red"" in the output sequence correlates with the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence. Here are the breakdowns:

1. ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" to ""red.""
2. ""dax"" translates to ""green"" (the new word in this input and output set), ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and again ""wif"" to ""red.""
3. ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" The word ""wif"" is at the end and is followed by ""red"" in the output sequence.
4. ""wif"" is once again at the end before ""dax,"" which is known to translate to ""green,"" but there is no green in this sequence, which means ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
5. The order is ""zup"" (yellow), ""wif"" (red), ""bluf"" (red). We see ""wif"" corresponds with ""red"" once again.

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,25,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the correspondence between the inputs and the outputs:

1. Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
2. Input: zup lug walm wif dax -> Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
3. Input: lug zup wif -> Output: blue yellow red
4. Input: zup walm lug wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
5. Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red

Considering ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"", we can focus on the word ""wif"". Notice that when ""wif"" appears, the immediately following color is ""red"". The word preceding ""wif"" does not seem to change this pattern. Additionally, there is no output color for ""wif"" on its own (i.e., not followed by a word that converts to a color). It suggests that ""wif"" signals the output color to repeat the previous color mentioned.

Examining example 1, ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" and since ""walm"" corresponds to ""red,"" the output sequence is ""yellow red red red"". Looking now at example 2, ""dax"" comes after ""wif"" and since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" the output includes ""red green"" at the end. The role of ""wif"" here seems to be introducing the repeatability of the color that immediately follows it in the output.

Let's summarize this pattern as a rule for the nonce word ""wif"":

Rule: ""wif"" signals that the color of the word immediately following it should be repeated in the output (the first instance of the color is as if ""wif"" has no color and the repetition is the actual color translation of the following word). If ""wif"" is the last word or is not followed by a color-associated word, the output is ""red"".

So, based on the rule induction from the examples given, the meaning of ""wif"" could be stated as:

wif -> ""Repeat the color of the next word in the output. If 'wif' is at the end or not followed by a word with an assigned color, translate 'wif' to red.""",0.9,25,wif
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of ""wif"" is followed by a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it. Here is how ""wif"" operates in each line:

1. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
The word ""wif"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" Therefore, ""wif"" converts ""zup"" into a repetition of ""red,"" as indicated by the multiple reds following it.

2. zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green
The word ""wif"" follows ""walm"" which corresponds to ""blue."" Therefore, ""wif"" repeats ""blue"" three times (implied by the word ""walm"" before it and output after ""wif"").

3. lug zup wif -> blue yellow red
Here, ""wif"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" So ""wif"" converts ""yellow"" into a single ""red.""

4. zup walm lug wif -> yellow yellow yellow blue red
In this case, ""wif"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" Therefore, ""wif"" changes ""blue"" to ""red.""

5. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
Again, ""wif"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" So ""wif"" results in repeating ""red"" after it.

Considering these examples, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" changes the color of the word before it to ""red,"" and when the previous word is repeated before ""wif,"" the output of that color is repeated after ""wif."" However, this rule does not fit perfectly for the second example, where ""blue"" is repeated thrice and followed by a single ""red.""

So the rule we can extract, with an exception noted in example two, is as follows:

Rule: The word ""wif"" converts the color associated with the immediately preceding word into ""red,"" and if the preceding word indicates multiple (more than one) repetitions, then ""wif"" causes a repetition of ""red"" equivalent to the repetitions indicated before ""wif.""

With no additional information to clarify the second example further, this is the most consistent rule we can deduce with the examples given.",0.8,25,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" seems to affect the sequence of colors in the output. Specifically, when ""wif"" is present in the input, the color that directly follows ""wif"" differs from the established pattern and adds an additional color to the sequence. Let's look at each example:

- ""zup wif walm"" -> yellow red red red. ""Wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" which corresponds to red. Without ""wif,"" ""walm"" would be expected to correspond to yellow since ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""zup lug walm wif dax"" -> yellow blue blue blue red green. Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" and green appears in the output even though it is preceded by ""lug"" and ""walm,"" which both correspond to blue.
- ""lug zup wif"" -> blue yellow red. ""Wif"" is at the end and the word before it ""zup"" corresponds to yellow but ""wif"" causes red to appear instead.
- ""zup walm lug wif"" -> yellow yellow yellow blue red. ""Wif"" is at the end and the pattern seems to be yellow but red appears at the end instead.
- ""zup wif bluf"" -> yellow red red. ""Wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" again, there is an additional ""red"" in the sequence.

Rule: The presence of ""wif"" in the input results in the color red being added to the output sequence, regardless of the preceding patterns. Additionally, it seems to affect the color following ""wif"" especially if ""wif"" is at the end, in that case, it simply turns what would be yellow into red.

Therefore, the rule I can induct for ""wif"" is:

wif -> Adds the color red to the output sequence and affects the subsequent color, changing it to red if ""wif"" is at the end or following it with an additional unexpected color otherwise.",0.8,25,wif
"Based on the given examples, let's identify the associated colors with each word:

- ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow.
- ""walm"" is associated with the color red, and it seems to be repeated for the number of occurrences of ""walm"" in the input.
- ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.
- ""dax"" is associated with the color green.
- ""bluf"" is associated with the color red, but since it does not repeat, it's unclear whether repetition is a characteristic of the word ""walm"" exclusively or any word that translates to ""red"".

Now, to discern what ""wif"" means in terms of the associated colors, let's analyze its occurrence and the resulting colors:

1. Whenever ""wif"" appears, the color red is in the output.
2. ""wif"" does not seem to translate to a color that has been used to represent any other word so far.
3. The color that follows red after ""wif"" is not consistent across examples and seems to depend on what word follows ""wif"" (if any).

Given the above observations, it seems that ""wif"" introduces a repetition of the color that follows its occurrence. When there is a word after ""wif"" that represents a color, that color is repeated once. When ""wif"" is the last word in the sequence, it repeats the color that was introduced by the word prior to ""wif"".

Applying this rule:

- In the first example, ""wif walm""—""walm"" is red, and ""wif"" induces a repetition, resulting in ""red red red"".
- In the second example, ""wif dax""—""dax"" is green, and ""wif"" precedes it, causing a repetition of the preceding color which is red.
- In the third example, ""wif"" is the last word and follows ""zup lug""—""lug"" is blue, and ""zup"" is yellow. ""wif"" induces a repetition of the color that was introduced by the word prior to ""wif"", which is blue, resulting in ""red"".
- In the fourth example, the sequence ""lug wif"" again causes a repetition of the color blue which is associated with ""lug"".
- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf""—""bluf"" is not defined, but since it results in red which is the same color as ""walm,"" we can assume that ""bluf"" is another word that translates to red but without repetition. ""wif"" therefore seems to be causing ""red"" to be repeated once.

Thus, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be:

wif -> causes the repetition of the color represented by the word that follows; if ""wif"" is the last word, it repeats the color of the word that precedes it.",0.8,25,wif

"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color corresponding to the word directly preceding ""bluf"".",1.0,25,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" has a pattern associated with its translation into color. The rule appears to be that ""bluf"" translates to the color that corresponds to the color of the word preceding it. Let's look at each example more closely:

1. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red
   * Here, the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" which translates to red. Thus, ""bluf"" also translates to red.

2. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue yellow red red green
   * Similar to the above, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and is associated with red. So ""bluf"" is also red.

3. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   * Again, the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" which is rendered as red. ""Bluf"" is also red.

4. Input: dax bluf wif
   Output: green green red
   * Here, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and is translated to green. Therefore, ""bluf"" also becomes green.

5. Input: lug bluf wif
   Output: blue blue red
   * Similar to the previous, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and is translated to blue. Thus, ""bluf"" is also blue.

Based on these observations, the word ""bluf"" translates to the same color as the word that comes directly before it. 

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the preceding word.",1.0,25,bluf
"From the given examples, we can deduce that the output sequence is consistently a repetition of the color translation for the word immediately preceding ""bluf,"" followed by a 'red' entry after the word ""wif"" in the sequence. 

The examples show:

1. ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow green yellow green red red""
   (""dax"" translates to ""green,"" followed by ""wif bluf,"" which translates to ""red red"")
   
2. ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue yellow red red green""
   (""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" then ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"")
   
3. ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red red""
   (""walm"" is not provided but following the pattern, it could potentially translate to ""blue,"" and ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"")

5. ""lug bluf wif"" -> ""blue blue red""
   (""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red"")

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word right before ""bluf,"" and when followed by ""wif"" it appends a ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before ""bluf."" If followed by ""wif,"" append ""red"" after the repeated color.",1.0,25,bluf
Rule: bluf -> a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it.,1.0,25,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns before and after it appears in the examples:

1. zup dax zup dax wif bluf -> yellow green yellow green red red
2. dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green
3. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
4. dax bluf wif -> green green red
5. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red

It appears that ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it, and then followed by ""red."" Example 3 has ""walm"" which doesn't have another word before it to match, but each occurrence of ""walm"" is translated to ""blue."" Given the context, we would assume ""bluf"" should not be affected by non-repeating words. However, the rule ""bluf"" causes it to repeat the preceding color still applies. After repeating the preceding color, ""bluf"" is followed by ""red"" in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word, followed by the color ""red"".",1.0,25,bluf
"Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates that the color of the previous word should be repeated in the output.

Let's analyze the examples in light of this rule:

- Input: dax walm zup lug dax

- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug

  In this sequence, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" whose color is blue, hence ""walm"" also translates to blue.

- Input: zup walm

  In this case, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.

- Input: zup walm

- Input: lug zup walm lug

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with the output color green only when it follows the input word ""dax"". In other instances, ""walm"" results in the output color yellow. To summarize the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: 
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", then the output is green.
- In all other cases, the output for ""walm"" is yellow.

Thus, walm -> meaning might be as follows:
- walm after ""dax"" -> green
- walm without preceding ""dax"" -> yellow",1.0,25,walm
"Given the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" affects the output by repeating the color of the word that precedes it. Here is the analysis:

- Input: dax walm zup lug dax
  Output: green green green yellow blue green
  - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""walm"" that follows ""dax"" repeats the ""green"" output.

- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
  Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
  - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" that follows ""lug"" repeats the ""blue"" output.

- Input: zup walm
  Output: yellow yellow yellow
  - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" that follows ""zup"" repeats the ""yellow"" output.

- Input: zup walm
  Output: yellow yellow yellow
  - This is a repetition of the previous example, providing further confirmation.

- Input: lug zup walm lug
  Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
  - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" that follows it repeats the ""yellow"" output.

Based on these observations, we can define the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: 
walm -> The value of ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to repeat. If the preceding word is associated with a color, ""walm"" repeats that color in the output sequence.",1.0,25,walm
"From the examples provided, it seems that each time the nonce word ""walm"" is used, the output is ""green"" once followed by a sequence of ""yellow."" However, the number of ""yellow"" outputs following the ""green"" seems to be dependent on the number of words between each occurrence of ""walm"" and the word ""lug"" that comes before it. To clarify, here are the observed patterns:

1. In the first example, there are two words (""zup lug"") between the single occurrence of ""walm"" and the preceding ""lug,"" and the output after ""green"" is ""yellow yellow.""

2. In the second example, there are three words (""zup bluf lug"") between ""walm"" and the preceding ""lug,"" and the output after ""green"" is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

3. In the third and fourth examples, there are no words between ""walm"" and the preceding ""lug,"" and the output after ""green"" is ""yellow.""

4. In the fifth example, there is one word (""zup"") between ""walm"" and the preceding ""lug,"" and the output after ""green"" is ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" translates to ""green"" followed by a ""yellow"" for each word between ""walm"" and the last occurrence of ""lug"" before it.

Rule: walm -> ""green"" followed by a ""yellow"" for each word between the occurrence of ""walm"" and the nearest preceding ""lug.""",0.8,25,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the given input-output examples.

Firstly, we notice that whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, consecutive ""yellows"" appear in the output.

1. In the first input, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup lug dax,"" and in the output, there are three consecutive ""green"" followed by ""yellow blue green.""

2. In the second input, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""dax lug,"" and in the output, we see ""blue blue"" before ""green blue,"" with the ""green"" corresponding to ""walm.""

3. In the third and fourth inputs, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" and the outputs are three consecutive ""yellow.""

4. Lastly, in the fifth input, ""walm"" follows ""lug zup"" and precedes ""lug,"" and in the output, after ""blue yellow,"" there are three ""yellow"" followed by ""blue.""

The common pattern is that the presence of ""walm"" results in three consecutive ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of what comes before it.

However, it's important to note that ""yellow"" in our examples is associated with the word ""zup,"" which always appears before ""walm"" in the given second, third, and fourth examples. In the fifth example, ""walm"" comes after a ""lug zup"" sequence, which corresponds to ""blue yellow"" in the output, suggesting that ""lug"" could be ""blue"" and the presence of ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" following it.

Hence, with the given data, ""walm"" appears to convert the following sequence of colors into ""yellow,"" overriding the typical color that would have been expected.

A more explicit explanation isn't available because each instance of ""walm"" affects multiple colors, not just one, making it unclear what ""dax"" or ""lug"" immediately following ""walm"" contributes to in terms of color without further examples without ""walm.""

Given these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in an input sequence, the next three words in the sequence (or the remaining words if fewer than three) translate to the color ""yellow"" in the output sequence regardless of their normal color associations.

Hence:
walm -> causes the next three components in the series to become ""yellow."" If fewer than three components follow, all of them turn into ""yellow.""",0.8,25,walm

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green.""",1.0,26,dax
"Given the evidence presented in the examples, we can deduce a pattern that indicates the meaning of ""dax"" in these scenarios. Each time the word ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green,"" regardless of what other words surround it. This would suggest that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green.""

Rule:
dax -> green",1.0,26,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

1. Every instance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
2. No other word consistently corresponds to ""green"" in the output. 
3. ""dax"" produces ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

From these observations, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: dax -> green

This means ""dax"" translates to the word ""green.""",1.0,26,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"" as follows:

1. In each instance where ""dax"" is presented in the input, the corresponding output is ""green.""
2. The term ""dax"" does not appear to be dependent on its position in the sequence; no matter where it is placed, the output remains consistent.

This leads to a simple rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,26,dax
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word 'dax' always corresponds to the output 'green'. Therefore, the rule is straightforward:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,26,dax
"Rule: wif -> red

From the examples given, we can deduce the following mappings for words to colors:

- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""

Regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence, the output consistently includes ""red"" in the corresponding position.",1.0,26,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that 'wif' translates to the color 'red', and each different word before 'wif' translates to a different color. The sequence of the colors in the output corresponds to the sequence of the words in the input. Here are the translations from the examples:

- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""lug"" -> blue

So the rule for 'wif' seems to be as follows:

wif -> red

Using this rule, whenever we see 'wif' in the input, we can expect to see 'red' in the corresponding position in the output. The other words in the input determine the other colors in the output sequence.",1.0,26,wif
"Based on the provided examples where the nonce word ""wif"" is used, we can establish the following relationships:

- When ""zup"" is mentioned, the output includes ""yellow.""
- When ""dax"" is mentioned, the output includes ""green.""
- The position of ""dax"" and ""zup"" in the input determines the order of ""green"" and ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
- The presence of ""wif"" always results in ""red"" being in the output.

In all instances, ""wif"" produces ""red"" in the output, and it is always the last color listed, suggesting that ""wif"" corresponds to a terminal signal for the color sequence, ending with red.

Thus, the rule we can deduce is: wif -> red, and it signals the end of the color sequence.

Rule: wif -> red (terminal color in the sequence)",1.0,26,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that each unique word before ""wif"" translates to a specific color. The word ""wif"" itself consistently translates to the color ""red."" Other words translate to other colors: ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Following this pattern, ""wif"" would represent the color that is always added at the end of the sequence, regardless of the other words present.

The rule is as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" consistently represents the color ""red"" at the end of a color sequence.",1.0,26,wif
"Based on the provided examples, wif appears to correspond directly to the color red, regardless of what other words are present or their order. However, each other word (zup, dax, lug) corresponds to a different color, and these words precede the color they correlate to. The sequence of words dictates the sequence of colors in the output. Hence, wif is consistently followed by red. The rule can be expressed as:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,26,wif
"zup -> yellow.

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Each word following ""zup"" represents another color, with ""dax"" translating to ""green,"" ""lug"" translating to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" translating to a repetition of ""yellow"" three times. When ""zup"" stands alone, it only outputs ""yellow."" When combined with other words, it keeps its meaning and adds the meanings associated with the subsequent words.",1.0,26,zup
"Rule: The term ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Each subsequent word modifies the output by adding additional colors or repetitions of ""yellow"". The specific rules for how these colors are modified based on the additional words are not clear from the examples provided. However, it can be deduced that ""lug"" correlates to the color ""blue"", but without more examples, it's unclear how ""dax"", ""walm"", and ""bluf"" specifically modify the output. ""Walm"" seems to cause a repetition of ""yellow"" three times, but further examples would be necessary to confirm the pattern for other words.

zup -> yellow

Further examples would be needed to fully understand the color pattern and to deduce the rules for the modifying words (""dax"", ""walm"", ""lug"", ""bluf"").",1.0,26,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"". Each additional word after ""zup"" maps to an additional color, but we only need to focus on what ""zup"" signifies for this task. Therefore, the following rule can be deduced:

Rule: ""zup"" -> ""yellow""",1.0,26,zup
"zup -> yellow.

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Each subsequent word after ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color: ""dax"" is green, ""walm"" indicates repeating the color yellow three times, ""lug"" is blue, and ""bluf"" corresponds to an additional ""yellow.""",1.0,26,zup
"zup -> ""yellow""

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" When ""zup"" is followed by another nonce word, it generates an output of ""yellow"" followed by the colors that these additional words represent. Each additional nonce word translates to a color based on the following pattern identified from the given examples:

- dax -> green
- walm -> yellow (repeated three times suggests that ""walm"" could possibly represent three yellow instances)
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> yellow (since ""bluf lug"" resulted in ""yellow blue,"" it can be proposed that ""bluf"" represents another instance of yellow similar to ""zup"")

When ""zup"" is used alone, it results in the output of ""yellow"" by itself.",1.0,26,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color, and ""bluf"" consistently results in ""red."" To confirm this, we can analyze the pairings of the other words and their outputs:

1. ""wif"" appears alongside ""bluf"" and is associated with red.
2. ""dax"" is paired with green.
3. ""lug"" is paired with blue.
4. ""zup"" does not have a direct output color associated with it, but since ""dax"" and ""lug"" do, and ""zup"" varies, we might infer ""zup"" is yellow.

Given that ""bluf"" outputs red when it appears with ""wif,"" which also outputs red, and there are no instances of ""bluf"" outputting a different color, we can induce the following:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""bluf"" means red.",1.0,26,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the examples provided and compare the inputs to their corresponding outputs, focusing on the variations where ""bluf"" is present.

Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green
Input: wif bluf lug -> Output: red red blue
Input: dax zup lug zup bluf -> Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red

Here, the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" It's also apparent that ""bluf"" does not change its output in different contexts—it leads to the same output even when the surrounding words vary. This consistent mapping from ""bluf"" to ""red,"" regardless of the input's context, is indicative of a direct translation rather than a more complex rule. 

Therefore, we can deduce:

bluf -> meaning: red
Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output.",1.0,26,bluf
"Based on the examples provided:

- Every instance of ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red"".
- Every instance of ""dax"" corresponds to a single ""green"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" each time it is mentioned.
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" each time it appears.
- The word ""bluf"" appears in various contexts and always seems to precede a color that has already been mentioned immediately before it, without introducing a new color of its own.

With this pattern in mind, it appears that ""bluf"" is a repeater or duplicator, which means it causes the next term in the sequence to repeat the color of the previous term.

Rule: bluf -> causes the next color to repeat the color immediately prior to it.",1.0,26,bluf
"To determine the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can analyze the commonalities in the input-output pairs.

1. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
2. ""wif bluf lug""      -> ""red red blue""
3. ""dax zup lug zup bluf""      -> ""green yellow blue yellow yellow""
4. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
5. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""

From the examples provided, we can observe that every time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output. Moreover, the output always contains two instances of ""red"" exactly at the place corresponding to the word ""bluf."" We can therefore conclude that ""bluf"" correlates with the output ""red red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: bluf -> ""red red""",1.0,26,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"", let's analyze each instance and its corresponding output:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm - Output: red red green green green
2. Input: wif bluf lug - Output: red red blue
3. Input: dax zup lug zup bluf - Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
4. Input: wif bluf - Output: red red
5. Input: wif bluf - Output: red red

Looking at examples 4 and 5, we see that both inputs are identical and produce the same output. Consequently, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red"" given that repeating the input produces the same repeated color output without variation.

As for the rest of the examples, they indicate that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". ""Walm"" and ""zup"" are not repeated in any other examples to determine a pattern therefore we cannot deduce a rule for these.

However, based on the consistently repeating pairs, we can conclude the following:

""wif"" -> ""red""
""bluf"" -> ""red""
""dax"" -> ""green""
""lug"" -> ""blue""

There is not enough data provided about how ""walm"" and ""zup"" relate to the output colors, but in the inputs where ""bluf"" appears, it is always followed by ""red"" in the output. Thus, the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" based on these five examples, is linked to the color red.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> ""red""",0.8,26,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to be associated with the color ""green."" However, it appears that the color green is repeated a number of times equal to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence. For instance, if ""walm"" is the second word in the sequence, ""green"" is outputted twice. If ""walm"" is the first word, ""green"" is outputted once, and so on. Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" translates to the color green repeated as many times as its position in the input sequence.

Rule: walm -> ""green"" repeated n times, where n is the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.",1.0,26,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with the color ""green."" In each example, every time ""walm"" is used, it is translated into ""green"" in the output. Additionally, it seems that multiple occurrences of ""walm"" result in consecutive ""greens"" in the output. Thus, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: walm -> ""green""",1.0,26,walm
"From the above examples, it seems that ""walm"" designates that the following words will repeat the color assigned to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" until a new color word is encountered or the sequence ends. In other words, ""walm"" induces the repetition of the previous color code.

Here's the breakdown:

- Input: dax wif walm lug zup
  Output: green red red red blue yellow
  Explanation: ""wif"" is red, after ""walm"" is encountered, ""lug"" also becomes red until a new color (blue for ""zup"") is introduced.

- Input: dax walm
  Output: green green green
  Explanation: ""dax"" is green, and ""walm"" makes the following entries green as well, which means all are green since no new color word is mentioned.

- Input: dax walm zup lug dax
  Output: green green green yellow blue green
  Explanation: After ""walm"", ""zup"" changes the color to yellow, ""lug"" follows with blue, and ""dax"" introduces green again.

- Input: zup wif dax walm lug
  Output: yellow red green green green blue
  Explanation: ""dax"" is green, and after ""walm"", ""lug"" continues as green until the sequence ends.

- Input: dax walm zup lug walm
  Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
  Explanation: ""dax"" is green, ""walm"" repeats the green until ""zup"" (which is yellow), then ""lug"" is blue, and another ""walm"" makes the following entries blue as well.

Rule: walm -> Induces the repetition of the color of the word immediately preceding it until a new color word appears.",1.0,26,walm
"Observing the outputs for each example where the word ""walm"" is present, it seems that the output colors correspond to repeating the color associated with the previous word. For the first occurrence of ""walm,"" it seems to inherit the color of ""dax,"" since ""dax"" precedes it. For subsequent occurrences, ""walm"" maintains the color of the word right before it.

Let's review the examples:

1. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   After ""dax"" (green) comes ""wif"" (red), and then ""walm,"" which repeats the red color. ""Lug"" then continues with red, followed by ""zup"" which changes to blue, then ""yellow"" which is not represented by text and is probably a default for the last unspecified term.

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Here ""dax"" (green) is directly followed by ""walm,"" which repeats the green twice.

3. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   Here ""dax"" (green) is followed by ""walm"" that repeats green two times. Then we see ""zup"" (yellow), followed by ""lug"" (blue), ending with another ""dax"" (green).

4. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   ""Zup"" (yellow) is followed by ""wif"" (red), then ""dax"" (green) comes before ""walm,"" which continues with green and the pattern concludes with ""lug"" (blue).

5. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   Here ""dax"" (green) is followed by ""walm"" that repeats green two times, then ""zup"" (yellow), followed by ""lug"" (blue), and ""walm"" repeats the blue color twice.

Based on these examples, ""walm"" seems to take on the color of the word immediately preceding it, continuing that color pattern until a new word introduces a different color. Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be repetition of the color of the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" is a placeholder that repeats the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,26,walm

Thus, zup -> yellow.",1.0,27,zup
"Rule: zup -> repeat the next color in the sequence.

Explanation:

- In the first example, ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" leads to a repeating of the color for ""lug,"" which is ""blue."" We infer that ""zup"" means to repeat the following color. 

- In the second example, ""zup wif walm lug"" gives us ""yellow red red red blue."" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" is subsequently also given as ""red."" Since ""zup"" precedes these, it seems to set off a pattern of repeating the color corresponding to ""wif"" (""red""), which is then interrupted by ""lug"" (""blue"").

- In the third example, ""zup lug walm wif walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue red red red."" This further affirms the rule as ""lug"" is ""blue"" and after ""zup"" it is repeated. The sequence does not have a ""zup"" before the ""wif"" hence why ""red"" isn't repeated immediately after ""wif."" ""walm"" after ""wif"" again initiates a repetition of ""red.""

- In the fourth example, ""zup dax bluf"" means ""yellow green green."" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and this sequence contains a repeated ""green"" which suggests that ""zup"" again triggered the repetition of the next color.

- In the fifth example, ""wif walm zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" It fits the rule that ""zup"" leads to the repetition of the next color, ""walm,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and we see ""red"" three times. The second ""zup"" causes the next ""walm"" to output ""yellow"" three times showing that ""zup"" has repeated the color that ""walm"" stands for which is ""red"" but is output as ""yellow"" due to the effect of ""zup.""

Therefore, based on the examples, ""zup"" seems to mean to repeat the output color of the next word thrice. If multiple ""zups"" are in sequence, the effect stacks for the next word.

"Based on the provided examples, each time the word ""zup"" appears, the output always contains a ""yellow"". However, the number of times ""yellow"" appears varies. To understand the pattern more clearly, let's examine the number of yellow outputs in relation to the position of ""zup"":

   - ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue""
   
2. ""zup"" as the first word, followed by the same word (""walm""), translates to a number of ""yellow"" outputs equal to the number of consecutive ""walm"":
   - ""zup lug walm wif walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""
   - Note: The second instance of ""walm"" is not consecutive to the first, so it does not add to the count of ""yellow"".
   
3. ""zup"" as the first word followed by a sequence of the same word repeats ""yellow"" for each repetition of the subsequent word:
   - ""wif walm zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow yellow yellow""
   - Here, the second ""walm"" after ""zup"" triggers two additional ""yellow"" since it repeats twice after ""zup"".

4. ""zup"" within a sequence without immediate repetition does not trigger additional ""yellow"" outputs related to subsequent words:
   - ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" -> ""green green red yellow blue""
   - ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green""

Rule: ""zup"" translates to a base ""yellow"". If ""zup"" is followed by one or more consecutive occurrences of the same word, the number of ""yellow"" outputs directly corresponds to the number of those consecutive words.
  
zup -> yellow (with the additional rule that consecutive repeating words after ""zup"" increment the count of ""yellow"" in the output).",0.9,27,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that 'zup' does not correspond to a single static color. Instead, 'zup' seems to translate to a sequence of colors that vary depending on the context of the other words in the input. 

To deduce the meaning of 'zup,' let's analyze the patterns of the outputs in relation to their inputs:

1. When ""zup"" is followed by ""lug"", the output is ""yellow blue"".
   - Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   - Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

2. When ""zup"" comes before ""wif"", the output is ""yellow red"".
   - Input: zup wif walm lug
   - Output: yellow red red red blue

3. When ""zup"" stands alone with other colors that are not immediately related to ""zup"", it outputs ""yellow"".
   - Input: zup dax bluf
   - Output: yellow green green
   - Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   - Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   
Given the variable outputs before and after the occurrence of 'zup,' we could infer a rule that 'zup' is a placeholder that changes output based on its position and/or the surrounding words. However, there seems to be a consistent pattern wherein 'zup' directly results in ""yellow"", and then the pattern changes according to the word that comes right after 'zup'.

Rule: 'zup' -> Initially translates to ""yellow"", followed by output changes that depend on subsequent words. Specifically, if 'zup' precedes 'lug', it is followed by ""blue""; if it precedes 'wif', it is followed by ""red"". If 'zup' comes before any other word or at the end, it stands alone as ""yellow"".",0.8,27,zup
"bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word. 

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" follows another word in the input, the output should repeat the color corresponding to the previous word in the output. For example, if ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which outputs ""yellow,"" then ""bluf"" produces ""yellow yellow."" If ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which outputs ""blue,"" then ""bluf"" produces ""blue blue.""",1.0,27,bluf
"bluf -> duplicate the color of the following word. Rule: The output for 'bluf' is the color associated with the next word in the input, duplicated once. For instance, 'bluf wif' results in 'red red,' and 'bluf lug' leads to 'blue blue.'",1.0,27,bluf
"From the examples provided, we can attempt to determine the pattern that dictates the translation from the input to the output. Let's look at how 'bluf' corresponds to the output color in each instance:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - 'zup' results in a single 'yellow'
   - 'bluf' might result in a second 'yellow', but more examples are needed to confirm.
   - 'wif' corresponds to a 'red'
   - 'walm' corresponds to two additional 'reds'

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm -> Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   - 'wif' corresponds to a 'red'
   - 'zup' corresponds to a single 'yellow'
   - 'bluf' might result in another 'yellow', consistent with the first example, and possibly relates to the word prior to 'bluf'.
   - 'lug' corresponds to three 'blue'

3. Input: wif dax bluf -> Output: red green green
   - 'wif' corresponds to a 'red'
   - 'dax' corresponds to a 'green'
   - 'bluf' results in another 'green', mirroring the color produced by the word preceding it.

4. Input: lug bluf -> Output: blue blue
   - 'lug' corresponds to a 'blue'
   - 'bluf' results in another 'blue', consistent with mirroring the preceding color.

Given the repeating pattern where 'bluf' seems to result in the color immediately preceding it being repeated, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: 'bluf' -> meaning: 'bluf' causes the color associated with the word before it to be repeated. If 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', then 'zup bluf' will yield 'yellow yellow'. If 'wif' corresponds to 'red', then 'wif bluf' will result in 'red red', and so on.",1.0,27,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we will look at the relationship between the input and the output in each example.

The outputs are sequences of colors, and each color corresponds to a certain word input. To identify the rule that assigns each input to a color, let's look at the consistent patterns:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow"".
- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"".
- Whenever ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue"".
- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"".

Watching for the word ""bluf,"" we see:

1. ""zup bluf wif walm"" produces ""yellow yellow red red red"". We can infer ""walm"" means ""red"". Since the double ""yellow"" seems to correspond to ""zup bluf"" and ""zup"" is already known to mean ""yellow"", it's logical to assume ""bluf"" has generated an additional ""yellow"".
   
2. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" leads to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"" where ""lug"" is linked to the triple ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" We saw earlier ""walm"" is ""red"", but it does not appear here. Noting that the sequence includes an extra ""yellow"" and extra ""blues"" suggests ""bluf"" might lead to the repetition of the preceding color.

3. ""wif dax bluf"" results in ""red green green"". Here, ""dax"" is known to be ""green,"" and we see an extra ""green"" following it, which points to ""bluf"" causing a repetition of the preceding color once again.

4. ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"". ""Lug"" is ""blue,"" and the output contains a repeated ""blue,"" aligning with previous observations regarding ""bluf"".

5. ""wif dax bluf"" outputs ""red green green"" again, where ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""bluf"" seems to have caused the ""green"" to repeat, just as before.

Based on the patterns above, ""bluf"" seems to prompt the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> Causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,27,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" we'll analyze its use in different input-output pairs. The presence of the word ""bluf"" consistently results in the word ""red"" appearing twice in the output when paired with ""wif,"" and the word ""blue"" appearing twice when paired with ""lug."" Additionally, when ""bluf"" appears with ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" twice.

From these observations, we can deduce the rule that the word ""bluf"" is an intensifier that causes the next color to be repeated. So the color-word following ""bluf"" is repeated in its color form in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Causes the next color in the sequence to be repeated.",0.8,27,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" doesn't directly correspond to a single color like the other words do. Instead, ""walm"" seems to cause the previous color word to repeat three times. For instance, when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow""; when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the previous word three times.",1.0,27,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" dictates a repetition of the color that comes afterwards (or before, if it is the last word). When ""walm"" is present, the color following it is repeated three times in the output.

Here's the breakdown of the rule application:
- Example 1: ""walm lug"" -> yellow repeated three times, followed by blue (for lug).
- Example 2: ""zup walm"" -> yellow repeated three times (cause it is followed by a wif which is yellow).
- Example 3: ""dax walm"" -> green repeated three times (since ""walm"" is the last word, it takes the color of dax).
- Example 4: ""zup walm"" -> yellow repeated three times, followed by green (for dax) and blue (for lug).
- Example 5: ""dax walm lug"" -> green repeated three times (due to ""walm""), followed by blue (for lug).

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the next word three times. If ""walm"" is the last word, repeat the color of the previous word three times.",1.0,27,walm
"walm -> meaning. Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the next word to be repeated three times in the output. 

For example, in the first input, ""walm lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow""; in the second input, ""walm wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow""; in the third input, simply ""walm"" results in ""green green green"", indicating that without a following word, ""walm"" is interpreted as green repeated thrice.",1.0,27,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""walm."" By comparing the input with its corresponding output, we can look for a pattern or rule that applies to the use of ""walm.""

From the input and output pairs, we can see that every time the term ""walm"" is used, it is followed by three colors in the output. The color that is repeated three times corresponds to the color that follows the word ""walm"" in the sequence:

- In the first example, ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" the color ""yellow"" repeats three times after ""walm,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" which is the fourth color in the output.

- In the second example, ""wif lug zup walm wif lug,"" the color ""yellow"" repeats three times after ""walm,"" as ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

- In the third example, ""dax walm,"" the color ""green"" repeats three times, where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

- In the fourth example, ""zup walm dax lug,"" the color ""yellow"" repeats three times after ""walm,"" followed by ""green"" for ""dax"" and then ""blue"" for ""lug.""

- In the fifth example, ""dax walm lug,"" the color ""green"" repeats three times after ""walm,"" followed by ""blue"" for ""lug.""

From this pattern, we can induce that ""walm"" indicates to repeat the color that corresponds to the following word three times in the output. The only exception is when ""walm"" is the last word, in which case the color of the preceding word is repeated. When not at the end, the following word's corresponding color is repeated.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the following word three times in the output. If ""walm"" is at the end of the input, it repeats the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.",0.9,27,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the consistencies in the relationship between the input and output across all examples. Here's the breakdown:

1. Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the output produces a series of ""yellow"" that matches the number of words preceding ""walm"" in the input sequence, followed by the colors that correspond to the words following ""walm.""

    - In ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" ""zup"" appears once before ""walm,"" resulting in one ""yellow,"" followed by the colors for ""lug,"" ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax.""
    - In ""wif lug zup walm wif lug,"" ""walm"" is preceded by three words, resulting in three ""yellow"" in the output.
    - In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" is the only word before ""walm,"" leading to a single ""yellow"" in the output.

2. The words following ""walm"" always correspond to their particular color outputs: ""lug"" -> blue, ""dax"" -> green, and so forth.

Thus, it appears that the rule of ""walm"" in these examples is to repeat the color ""yellow"" in the output for each word that precedes it in the input, and then continue with the color outputs for the following words according to their predetermined color mappings.

Rule: walm -> Repeat ""yellow"" in the output for each word that precedes ""walm"" in the input, then continue with the color outputs for the following words according to their specific mappings.",0.9,27,walm

"Rule: ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Explanation:
- In ""wif bluf zup,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" the output is ""red"" too, which shows ""bluf"" duplicates the color of ""wif.""
- In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""bluf,"" the output is ""green"" as well, supporting the duplication rule.
- In ""zup bluf dax,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow"" before it turns to ""green"" for ""dax,"" illustrating the duplication of ""zup's"" color due to ""bluf.""
- In ""lug wif lug bluf,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red."" After the second ""lug,"" ""bluf"" is used, resulting in ""blue,"" showing that it duplicated the color of ""lug"" that came before it.
- In ""zup wif bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" there's another ""red,"" indicating ""bluf"" duplicated the color of ""wif.""

"From the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color of the word that either comes before it or, if no word comes before it, the word that comes after it. To make this observation clearer, here are the rules applied for each input:

1. Input: `wif bluf zup` -> Output: `red red yellow`
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red;"" since it comes before ""bluf,"" ""bluf"" also translates to ""red.""

2. Input: `dax bluf` -> Output: `green green`

3. Input: `zup bluf dax` -> Output: `yellow yellow green`

5. Input: `zup wif bluf` -> Output: `yellow red red`
   - The word ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" hence ""bluf"" also translates to ""red.""

Based on these observations, the rule for the word ""bluf"" is:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word, or if it is the first word, takes the color of the following word.",1.0,28,bluf
Rule: bluf -> the color of the previous word repeated.,1.0,28,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze each example and look for a pattern or a rule that can help us deduce the meaning.

1. Input: wif bluf zup | Output: red red yellow
2. Input: dax bluf | Output: green green
3. Input: zup bluf dax | Output: yellow yellow green
4. Input: lug wif lug bluf | Output: blue red blue blue
5. Input: zup wif bluf | Output: yellow red red

Considering the outputs, it seems like ""bluf"" causes the preceding color word to repeat itself in the output. For example, in ""wif bluf zup,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""bluf"" we see ""red"" again. In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""bluf"" the word ""green"" is repeated. The same pattern holds for the other examples. 

Rule:
bluf -> causes the color word immediately before it to repeat in the output.",1.0,28,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the corresponding output for each occurrence of ""bluf"" in the input and identify any patterns.

1. Whenever ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""
3. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
4. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug wif lug,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
5. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup wif,"" the output is ""red red.""

From these patterns, it appears that ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. For instance, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red."" Similarly, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" following ""zup"" results in ""yellow yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> Duplicate the color associated with the preceding word.
",0.8,28,bluf
"From the examples provided, it seems that `walm` corresponds to the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. Here's how the rule applies in each example:

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
Rule: The color associated with ""lug"" is blue, so ""walm"" following it means ""repeat blue"" three times.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Rule: The color associated with ""zup"" is yellow, so ""walm"" following it means ""repeat yellow"" three times.

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green
Rule: ""walm"" comes after ""dax"", which is associated with green, so ""walm"" means ""repeat green"" three times.

Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
Rule: ""zup walm"" in this context means ""repeat yellow"" three times since ""zup"" is associated with yellow.

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
Rule: Even though ""dax"" follows ""walm"" here, the pattern is only considering the immediate predecessor of ""walm"". So, ""walm"" coming after ""wif"" means ""repeat red"" three times. ""Dax"" then results in a single green.

Putting all this together, we can induce the following rule:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

Rule: If ""x"" is a word associated with a specific color, then ""x walm"" translates to the color of ""x"" repeated three times.",1.0,28,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to consider the patterns present in each example. Let's analyze the inputs and outputs.

- In the first input ""lug walm,"" the output is three repetitions of the same color ""blue blue blue."" This indicates that ""walm"" might be related to the repetition of the color associated with ""lug.""
- In the second input ""zup walm,"" the output is three repetitions of the color ""yellow yellow yellow."" Like the first example, it appears that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with ""zup.""
- The third example ""wif lug dax walm"" results in ""red blue green green green."" We notice that ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the last color mentioned before ""walm,"" which in this case is the color associated with ""dax"" (green).
- In the fourth example ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" we see ""lug"" associated with ""blue,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" The output shows the colors repeat after ""walm"" in the sequence they were introduced prior to ""walm,"" and then a final ""lug"" results in another ""blue.""
- The final example ""wif walm dax"" has the output ""red red red green."" Here ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with ""wif"" (red) rather than allowing ""dax"" to introduce a new color.

Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to prompt the repetition of the color(s) mentioned prior to ""walm."" The number of repetitions is linked to the number of color words introduced before ""walm."" It's also important to note that the repetition follows the order in which the colors are introduced.

1. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue"".
2. When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
3. When ""lug dax walm"" are in sequence, the output is ""blue green green green"", taking into account the previous understanding of ""lug,"" it appears that ""dax"" contributes to ""green,"" and the pattern ""green green green"" follows ""walm.""
4. When ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" the output sequence includes blue twice for ""lug,"" follows with an undetermined ""bluf,"" ""green"" for ""dax,"" ""blue"" again for ""lug,"" then ""yellow yellow yellow"" for ""zup walm,"" and ""blue"" for the last ""lug.""
5. When ""wif walm dax"" is the sequence, the output is ""red red red green,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red.""

Based on these examples, it seems that ""walm"" has the following meaning:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times.

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug | Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
5. Input: wif walm dax | Output: red red red green

Observations:
- Whenever ""walm"" follows a word, the output is a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""walm.""
- The number of repetitions in the output corresponds to the number of words preceding ""walm,"" not counting ""walm"" itself.

Examples:
- In example 1, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" follows. The output is ""blue"" three times, which matches the number of words including ""walm"" in the input.
- In example 2, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" follows. The output is ""yellow"" three times, matching the number of words including ""walm.""
- In example 3, ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""green"" respectively. ""Walm"" comes after all three, and the output is the last color (""green"") repeated three times, which is the number of colors produced by words before ""walm.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""walm,"" and the number of repetitions is equal to the total number of words in the input sequence leading up to ""walm"" (including ""walm"").

3. ""wif lug dax walm"" -> ""red blue green green green""
4. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
5. ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green""

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the output of the color that precedes it to repeat three times. In examples 1 and 2, the words ""lug"" and ""zup"" are directly followed by ""walm"" and result in ""blue blue blue"" and ""yellow yellow yellow"" respectively. In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" however, the sequence ""green green green"" appears at the end, suggesting that ""walm"" does not always follow the color it repeats. But considering ""wif"" leads to ""red"" and ""red"" is repeated three times, it could be inferred that the color that ""walm"" is repeating can also appear earlier in the sequence, not necessarily immediately before ""walm.""

Example 4 further confirms this pattern where ""lug zup walm lug"" is in the sequence and results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" with ""zup"" leading to ""yellow"" being repeated three times. In example 5, ""wif walm dax"" outputs ""red red red green,"" showing that ""wif"" related to ""red"" is what gets repeated by ""walm"" even though ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" implying that the relationship of ""walm"" is not to the immediately preceding or following word.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the first word of the sequence three times. For example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" thus ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red.""

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the first word of the input sequence three times.",0.8,28,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can determine the meaning of the word ""lug"" by looking at what it translates to in each instance. 

In the first example, ""lug"" is used between two instances of ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow."" ""Lug"" is followed by ""dax"" which translates to ""green"" in other examples. Thus, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.

Input: zup lug zup dax
Output: yellow blue yellow green

In the second example, ""lug"" is interspersed with ""wif"" which translates to red, and again, the output corresponding to ""lug"" is ""blue.""

Input: lug wif lug wif lug
Output: blue red blue red blue

In the third and fourth example, ""lug"" maintains its translation to ""blue.""

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue

The last example further supports the conclusion as ""lug"" translates directly to ""blue.""

"In the given examples, the presence of the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. In every instance where ""bluf"" appears, regardless of what other words are present or their order, the output includes the color green. This allows us to deduce that the word ""bluf"" is associated with the color green.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

bluf -> green",1.0,29,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look for patterns in the association between the input and the output. Let us examine the given examples one by one and look for a consistent pattern:

1. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   
2. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow
   
3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   
4. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green
   
5. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green

The word ""bluf"" appears in all inputs and is consistently followed by the color word ""red"" in the output except for the last example, where it is followed by ""green."" However, in all instances where ""bluf"" is directly followed by ""dax,"" the word ""dax"" translates to ""green"" in the output. Therefore, we can infer that ""bluf"" does not directly impact the color that follows it.

By looking at the placement of ""bluf"" in the examples:

- In examples 1, 3, and 5 where ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output for ""wif"" is ""red,"" and for ""bluf,"" it is also ""red.""
- In example 4, where ""zup"" precedes ""dax"" and ""bluf,"" the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""bluf"" still generates ""green"" just like ""dax.""
- In example 2, ""bluf"" is at the end, preceded by ""zup,"" and the output for both is ""yellow.""

From the consistency of ""bluf"" always producing the same output color as the preceding word, it seems that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that comes before it in the sequence. When it is preceded by a word that translates to ""red,"" its output is ""red."" When preceded by ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" and when preceded by ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""green.""

Input: zup dax bluf

It appears that ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" There is no apparent variation in the output corresponding to ""bluf"" across the different inputs. Thus, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" is directly associated with the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input string or other surrounding words. Therefore, we can deduce the following:

"Analyzing the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color indicated by the word that immediately precedes it three times. Each word appears to be associated with a color, and the appearance of ""walm"" leads to the repetition of that color. Here are the associations based on the provided examples:

- ""wif"" is associated with the color red.
- ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow.
- ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.
- ""dax"" is associated with the color green.
- ""bluf"" seems to be a combination of ""blue"" and ""wif"" representing both blue and red.

To illustrate, in ""dax walm wif walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" following it causes ""green"" to be repeated three times; ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" following it causes ""red"" to be repeated three times. Similar patterns are seen in the other examples.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" acts as a repeated color word that precedes it. Here is the rule observed:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""green"" is repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color that immediately precedes it, three times.",1.0,29,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we observe how it alters the output in each example. We notice that the presence of ""walm"" generates a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. 

For instance, in the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" and ""lug"" on its own typically outputs a single ""blue."" So, ""walm"" caused ""lug"" to be represented by ""blue"" three times instead of once. In every instance, ""walm"" follows another word which is then repeated three times in the output. 

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,29,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" I will examine the examples and their corresponding outputs for patterns.

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" to ""blue""
   - ""lug"" to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" must correspond to a repetition of the color that was last mentioned before it, which is ""blue"" in this case.

2. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" to ""red""
   - ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" and before ""wif"" resulting in a repeat of ""green""
   - ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" resulting in a repeat of ""red""

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" results in a repeat of ""yellow""

4. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and results in a repeat of ""blue""

5. Input: dax lug walm zup wif

   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""lug"" to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" to ""red""
   - ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" resulting in a repeat of ""blue""

From these examples, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color that corresponds to the last nonce word mentioned before ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> means a repetition of the last color mentioned before the word ""walm"".",1.0,29,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the patterns in the provided examples:

- Example 1: ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue."" We notice that the word ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" The color ""blue"" is repeated twice after the word ""walm.""

- Example 2: ""dax walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""green green green red red red."" In this example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and precedes ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" Both colors are repeated twice after the word ""walm.""

- Example 3: ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the color ""yellow"" is repeated twice after ""walm.""

- Example 4: ""lug walm wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red red."" ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" corresponding to ""blue,"" and precedes ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" Both ""blue"" and ""red"" are repeated.

- Example 5: ""dax lug walm zup wif"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue yellow red."" ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" corresponding to ""blue,"" and precedes ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" Neither color is immediately repeated after ""walm.""

From the examples, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

- When ""walm"" is present in a sequence, the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" is repeated twice thereafter. 

Considering the above deduction doesn't hold for Example 5, we need to modify our understanding:
""Zup"" (""yellow"") is not repeated after ""walm,"" which breaks the initial rule. However, we still see ""blue"" (""lug"") three times and ""red"" (""wif"") once after ""walm."" Analyzing further, Example 2 shows that ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" (""red""), and we get three ""reds"" thereafter.

Taking into account the inconsistency in Example 5, we can adjust the rule to accommodate all examples. The word after the ""walm"" seems to determine the number of color repeats. When ""walm"" is followed by a different color word in the sequence, the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" is indeed repeated, and the sequence starting from the word following ""walm"" is also as per the color code of that word. The instance of ""walm"" does not repeat the next color in sequence but follows an unspecified pattern or could indicate a transition or transformation.

Rule: ""walm"" -> indicates a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word equal to the number of alphabets or the transition period once before commencing with the regular sequence denoted by subsequent words.

- In the second example ""Input: zup dax - Output: yellow green,"" the word ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green.""

- In the fourth example ""Input: wif zup walm dax zup - Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow,"" the word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" followed by the color ""yellow"" for the repeat of the word ""zup.""
- In the fifth example ""Input: zup wif dax - Output: yellow red green,"" ""dax"" stands for ""green"" again.

All the examples consistently show that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Hence, the rule for the word ""dax"" is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,30,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided. Let's analyze:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output contains the word ""green.""
- The position of ""dax"" in the input does not seem to affect the color it's associated with in the output; it is always ""green.""
- The word ""dax"" by itself corresponds to ""green"" in the output as seen in the second example: ""zup dax"" -> ""yellow green.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the phrase or context with other words. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""dax"":

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,30,dax
"From the given examples, it seems that each word (wif, zup, lug, walm) corresponds to a particular color:

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
Output: yellow green green yellow green

Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Input: dax lug zup dax
Output: green blue yellow green

From the examples where 'zup' is used, we can observe the following:

1. Whenever 'dax' appears after 'zup', 'green' follows in the output (Examples 1 and 5).
2. Whenever 'bluf' appears after 'zup', 'yellow' follows in the output (Examples 1 and 4).
3. 'zup' precedes 'lug', and 'yellow' follows in the output (Example 2).
4. In the third input, 'zup' is followed by 'wif', which is matched with 'green' in the output, but 'wif' is usually matched with 'red' as seen in other positions.

Based on these observations, the most consistent color following 'zup' is 'yellow'. Therefore, when 'zup' appears before any word, the output is 'yellow'. We do have a contradiction in Example 3, but without additional context or examples, it's safe to conclude that the rule for 'zup' might be that it correlates to 'yellow', except possibly in complex sequences where its presence influences or is influenced by surrounding words.

So the basic rule we can devise from the given information would be:

Rule: 'zup' generally translates to 'yellow' in the output, but context with surrounding words may alter this translation.",0.8,30,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to examine where it appears relative to other known words and the corresponding output colors. Let's consider the positions:

1. Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
   Output: yellow green green yellow green
   - ""dax"" correlates with green whether it follows ""zup"" or not.
   - ""bluf"" correlates with green when it follows ""zup"" but yellow when it does not. 

2. Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
   Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
   - ""lug"" correlates with blue when it follows ""zup"" but with blue in another example (""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm""). It suggests that ""zup"" does not change the color associated with ""lug.""
   - ""bluf"" correlates with yellow again when following ""zup.""

3. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   - ""wif"" correlates with red and does not immediately follow ""zup.""
   - ""zup"" precedes a word that outputs yellow this time, which suggests ""zup"" might change the associated color of the word to yellow.

4. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - ""bluf"" directly follows ""zup"" and both output yellow again.

5. Input: dax lug zup dax
   Output: green blue yellow green
   - ""dax"" after ""zup"" outputs yellow, unlike other instances where it's green.

Analyzing all examples, it appears ""zup"" changes the color associated with the word that follows it to yellow if it's not the color originally associated with that word. If ""zup"" is placed before a word, its output color becomes yellow. The only exception is if the word naturally correlates with the color yellow, as we've seen with ""bluf"" following ""zup"" to still output yellow.

Rule: zup -> changes the following word's output color to yellow, unless the word's original output color is already yellow.",0.8,30,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow when immediately before or after ""dax""; otherwise, zup -> green.",0.0,30,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here are the observations leading to this conclusion:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color green, the output is ""green green.""
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color blue, the output is ""blue blue.""
3. ""zup dax bluf"" yields ""yellow green green,"" so ""bluf"" repeats the color green, which is associated with ""dax.""
4. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red, the output is ""red red.""
5. ""lug wif lug bluf"" yields ""blue red blue blue,"" where ""bluf"" repeats the blue corresponding to ""lug.""

Here are the associations from the given examples:

- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow."" This implies that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue."" This implies that ""lug"" means ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" in the input ""wif walm,"" the output is ""red red red,"" implying that ""wif"" means ""red.""

Based on this information, the rule regarding the meaning of ""walm"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color denoted by the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times.",1.0,30,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond with repeating the color associated with the previously mentioned nonce word three times. For instance:

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" must correlate with the color yellow, and ""walm"" indicates repeating that color three times.
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" must correlate with the color blue, and ""walm"" indicates repeating that color three times.

In the more complex example:

- ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" results in ""blue green yellow green green green red."" Here, ""lug"" is blue, ""dax"" is green, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""wif"" is red. The sequence ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" again causes the preceding color (""dax"" which is green) to be repeated three times.

Finally:

- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" so ""wif"" is assigned the color red, with ""walm"" tripling the mention of red.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding nonce word three times.",1.0,30,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to the repeated output of a color word. The color repeated three times in the Output section seems to be linked to the word that immediately precedes ""walm"" in the Input section. 

From the examples:
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""
- ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red""

Each time, the color that appears three times is tied to the word immediately before ""walm."" Given this pattern, it seems that ""walm"" acts as a directive to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,30,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to trigger the repetition of the color associated with the preceding nonce word three times. For instance:

- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"", indicating ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"", indicating ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".
- ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red"", indicating ""wif"" means ""red"".

When ""walm"" follows a sequence of nonce words and colors are produced in the output, the pattern is that the color associated with the immediately preceding nonce word is repeated three times.

Thus, the deduced meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times in the output.",1.0,30,walm
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,31,lug
"Observing the given examples and corresponding outputs, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in all instances. The other words in each example correspond to different colors consistently as well (dax -> green, zup -> yellow, etc.). Therefore, it can be deduced that:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,31,lug
lug -> blue,1.0,31,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""lug"" translates consistently to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output contains the word ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,31,lug
"Rule: Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"". Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue",1.0,31,lug
"Based on the examples given, it appears that each unique word is associated with a specific color:

- lug corresponds to ""blue""
- wif corresponds to ""red""
- walm corresponds to ""green"" when repeated three times, or it may represent a sequence of three greens regardless of the word.
- dax corresponds to ""green""

To confirm the rule, let's look at the provided examples in detail:

Input: dax lug bluf
Output: green blue blue
- Here, ""dax"" is translated to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
- The word ""bluf"" isn't directly translated, but since the output is ""blue,"" we can induce that ""bluf"" also corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""dax"" stands for ""green.""
- We can't determine the actual meaning of ""walm"" from this example alone because ""walm"" could mean ""green"" repeated three times or could imply a sequence regardless of the specific word.

Input: wif lug dax
Output: red blue green
- ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

Input: dax
Output: green
- Even on its own, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: wif dax lug
Output: red green blue
- ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

From these observations, the rule for ""dax"" seems consistent and not dependent on context:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,31,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Regardless of its position in the input, when ""dax"" is mentioned, the word ""green"" is included in the output. 

Here is the deduction:
- When ""dax"" appears with ""lug"" (`dax lug`), which corresponds to ""blue,"" the output is ""green blue."" 
- When ""dax"" appears alone, the output is simply ""green.""
- When ""dax"" appears at the end of the sequence following other words (`wif lug dax`), ""green"" appears at the end of the output sequence.
- In the position before ""lug,"" ""dax"" does not change the output for ""lug,"" which is always ""blue.""

This consistency across the examples leads us to conclude the meaning for ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,31,dax
"Rule: dax -> green.

Every example that includes the term 'dax' corresponds to a part of the output that is 'green', no matter its position in the input sequence.",1.0,31,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" is associated with the color green. Every instance of ""dax"" in the input correlates with ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position within the input sequence.

Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,31,dax
"Based on the examples given:

- Every time the word ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- The presence of ""dax"" does not seem to affect the translation of other words; ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" regardless of whether ""dax"" precedes or follows.

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" is independent of its position in the input sequence and translates consistently:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,31,dax
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,31,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".",1.0,31,wif

Therefore, the rule is:
wif -> red",1.0,31,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence. This is evidenced by every instance of ""wif"" resulting in ""red"" in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

"Rule: zup -> yellow

Meaning: Zup corresponds to the color yellow in each given context.",1.0,31,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" There are no variations in context that suggest a different meaning, as ""zup"" is always translated to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,31,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the examples provided. Every time ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow"".",1.0,31,zup
"Based on the provided examples, each time the word ""zup"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow.""

Therefore, we can deduce that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,31,zup
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word zup translates to the color yellow regardless of context.,1.0,31,zup
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" seems to mean ""repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word."" In each example, the color that follows ""bluf"" is a repetition of the color that translates from the word just before ""bluf.""

- In ""dax bluf wif zup wif,"" ""dax"" translates to green, and immediately after ""bluf"" comes another green.
- In ""dax bluf wif lug,"" after ""dax"" (green) and ""bluf"" comes another green.
- In ""lug bluf dax lug,"" after ""lug"" (blue) and ""bluf"" comes another blue.
- In ""zup lug bluf wif,"" after ""lug"" (blue) and ""bluf"" comes another blue.
- In ""zup bluf,"" after ""zup"" (yellow) and ""bluf"" comes another yellow.

Therefore, bluf -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color of the previous word.""",1.0,31,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that follows it. When ""bluf"" stands alone with no following word, it takes on the color of the word preceding it. Here's the observed pattern:

1. ""dax bluf wif"" resulted in ""green green red,"" so ""bluf"" mirrored the color of ""wif,"" which is red.
2. ""dax bluf wif lug"" followed the same pattern, with ""bluf"" mirroring the color of ""wif"" again.
3. In ""lug bluf dax lug,"" ""bluf"" mirrored the color of ""dax,"" which is green.
4. ""zup lug bluf wif"" saw ""bluf"" taking on the color of ""wif,"" which is red.
5. Finally, in ""zup bluf,"" there is no word after ""bluf"" so it took the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.

Rule:
bluf -> takes on the color of the word immediately following it; if there is no following word, it takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,31,bluf
"bluf -> repeats the color of the immediately preceding word. Rule: When the word 'bluf' follows another word, 'bluf' takes on the color value that was assigned to the word that comes directly before it.",1.0,31,bluf
"bluf -> repeats the color of the last mentioned color. Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,31,bluf
"Rule: ""bluf"" matches the color of the word that follows it. If there is no word following it, ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it.

Examples:
- In ""dax bluf wif zup wif,"" ""bluf"" precedes ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red, so ""bluf"" is red.
- In ""dax bluf wif lug,"" ""bluf"" precedes ""wif,"" so ""bluf"" is red.
- In ""lug bluf dax lug,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" is green.
- In ""zup lug bluf wif,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" so ""bluf"" is red.
- In ""zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and there is no word after it, so ""bluf"" takes the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.

bluf -> takes on the color of the following word; if there is no following word, repeats the color of the preceding word.",1.0,31,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" correlates to a repetition of the color associated with the word that came directly before it, three times. Here is the breakdown of how ""walm"" functions within each example:

1. wif walm -> red red red
   - ""wif"" means red, followed by ""walm"" which means repeat red three times.
   
2. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue
   - ""zup"" means yellow and ""lug"" means blue, followed by ""walm"" which means repeat blue three times.
   
3. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue
   - Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which means red. Therefore, ""walm"" translates to red repeated three times.
   
4. dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" means green, followed by ""walm"" which means repeat green three times. Later in the sequence, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which is blue, hence ""walm"" translates to blue repeated three times.
   
5. dax walm -> green green green
   - ""dax"" means green, followed by ""walm"" which means repeat green three times.

Given these observations, the most consistent rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color indicated by the preceding word three times.",1.0,31,walm
"Each example of ""walm"" output corresponds to a repeated word before it. In each case, the color associated with ""walm"" is repeated as many times as the color associated with the word directly preceding it.

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" is followed by ""red red red"", representing three instances of the color associated with ""wif"".
- In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" is followed by ""blue blue blue"", again, representing three instances of the color associated with ""lug"".
- In the third and fourth examples, the pattern is consistent, with ""walm"" taking the color of the word before it and repeating it a number of times equal to the number of instances of that word right before ""walm"".

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the output color of the preceding word the same number of times as that word's instances are present right before ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word as many times as that word occurs in sequence before walm.",1.0,31,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns where the word ""walm"" appears and the corresponding output:

- ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red""
- ""zup lug walm"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue""
- ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" corresponds to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue""
- ""dax walm zup lug walm"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue""
- ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green""

Here are the observations:

1. Each time ""walm"" appears in the input, a sequence of the same color repeats in the output.
2. The color that repeats corresponds to the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" (e.g., ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"").
3. The number of times the color repeats matches the number of syllables in the preceding word (e.g., ""wif"" has one syllable and results in ""red"" repeating once, ""dax"" has one syllable and results in ""green"" repeating thrice).
4. The word ""walm"" itself does not correspond to a fixed color but is more of an instruction for repetition according to the color and syllable count of the preceding word.

Based on the above observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" signals to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before it, with the number of repetitions equal to the number of syllables in that preceding word.

So,

walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word; number of repetitions equals the number of syllables in the preceding word.",1.0,31,walm
"From the given examples, we can induce the following pattern:

- ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red."" If ""wif"" is the equivalent of ""red,"" then adding ""walm"" seems to triple the output.
- ""zup lug walm"" produces ""yellow blue blue blue."" Since ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and ""lug"" means ""blue,"" appending ""walm"" to ""lug"" triples the blue output.
- ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" turns into ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" Here, ""bluf"" does not have a direct correspondence, but ""wif walm"" again results in a triple ""red."" The closing ""lug"" after ""walm"" is just blue once, not affected by ""walm.""
- ""dax walm zup lug walm"" becomes ""green green green yellow blue blue blue."" ""Dax"" therefore likely means ""green,"" and ""walm"" after ""dax"" triples the green. ""Zup"" remains ""yellow"" and ""lug walm"" again results in triple blue.
- ""dax walm"" directly translates to ""green green green,"" so again, ""dax"" seems to mean ""green,"" and ""walm"" triples the output.

Walm Rule: When following a color word, ""walm"" triples the output of that color word. If the color word is ""wif"" (red), ""zup"" (yellow), ""lug"" (blue), or ""dax"" (green), the corresponding color is repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.",1.0,31,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the examples provided:

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Looking at the outputs, ""walm"" seems to be associated with a repetition of the color immediately preceding it in the output. 

1. ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and when ""walm"" follows, the output is ""red"" repeated three times.
2. ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue""; when ""walm"" follows, it is ""blue"" repeated three times (matching the ""lug"" before it).
3. Similar pattern follows with ""dax"" leading to ""green"" and ""walm"" producing a triple ""green"" in the output.

From these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" in the output, three times.

Example: If ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" then ""lug walm"" would yield ""blue blue blue"" in the output.",0.8,31,walm
"lug -> blue

"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.",1.0,32,lug

dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green"".",1.0,32,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,32,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". The consistent rule across all examples when ""dax"" is present in the input is that ""green"" appears in the output. Therefore:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,32,dax
"To deduce the meaning of 'wif,' let's examine the relationship between the input and the output in the provided examples. 

Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow

In this example, each 'wif' precedes a word that gets the output 'red.' Further, 'dax' which follows the first 'wif' gets 'green.'

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

Here, 'wif' precedes 'walm', which is followed by 'red.' Also, we see that 'dax' stands alone without 'wif' and gives 'green' as in the previous example.

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

'Wif' here precedes 'zup', and the output is 'red yellow' respectively.

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

Again, 'wif' precedes 'bluf' and the output for 'wif' is 'red.'

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

'Wif' precedes 'walm' in this input, and once more, the output for 'wif' is 'red.'

Based on these observations, 'wif' consistently leads to the output 'red', regardless of its position or the word that follows.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,32,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we should first look for patterns and commonalities in the examples provided:

1. ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" -> ""yellow yellow red green red yellow""
2. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow""
3. ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""
4. ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red""
5. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""

By analyzing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can observe the following:

- The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""yellow."" (We assume this based on the outputs of examples 1 and 5, even though it's the same as ""zup"" despite being a different word, which might suggest a typo or a pattern that has not been fully clarified.)
- The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- The word ""walm"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- The word ""lug,"" which only appears once, translates to ""blue.""

The key focus is on the word ""wif."" In each instance where ""wif"" is used, it is followed by a ""red"" in the output (ignoring the example with two instances of ""wif,"" which might indicate a possible rule about repetition).

We notice that:

- When ""zup"" is followed by ""wif"", the next color is ""red.""
- When ""dax"" is preceded and followed by ""wif"", the color is ""red.""
- When ""wif"" stands alone with ""zup,"" it results in ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the color is ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" the color is ""red.""

Thus, it seems that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" on its own and does not have a context-dependent meaning (at least not with the examples given). We can rule out the possibility of ""wif"" meaning two consecutive ""red"" colors because when it appears in the input twice in a row, it still translates into a single ""red"" in the output.

Rule:
wif -> red",1.0,32,wif
"Rule: wif -> red. 

The appearance of the nonce word ""wif"" in each example always corresponds to the output ""red.""",1.0,32,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

Based on the pattern observed in the examples, we can conclude that every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. This correlation is consistent across all given examples, leading to the rule that ""wif"" translates to ""red.""",1.0,32,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we'll analyze the patterns in the given examples. Let's look at the instances of ""wif"" and their corresponding translations in the outputs:

1. In the first example, ""wif"" appears twice, with corresponding colours red and green in the output:
   - ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" -> ""yellow yellow red green red yellow""
2. In the second example, ""wif"" appears once, and the output colour is red:
   - ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow""
3. In the third example, ""wif"" appears once, and the output colour is red:
   - ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""
4. In the fourth example, ""wif"" appears once, and the output colour is red:
   - ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red""
5. In the fifth example, ""wif"" appears once, and the output colour is red:
   - ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""

Now let's analyze this information:
- ""wif"" consistently maps to the colour red in all instances except once, where it maps to green.
- The context in which ""wif"" maps to green is when it is followed by itself: ""wif dax wif"" results in ""red green red.""
- In all other contexts, ""wif"" maps to red.

Based on the examples given, we can derive the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the colour red, except when it is immediately followed by another ""wif,"" in which case the first ""wif"" translates to red and the second to green.",0.8,32,wif

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow each time it appears. There is a pattern where every unique word corresponds to a unique color. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow

"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" appears to be consistent regardless of context. Therefore:

"bluf -> repeat the color of the last word mentioned before bluf.

Rule: Bluf indicates that the output should repeat the color associated with the previous word the same number of times as the occurrences of 'bluf'. For example, if 'bluf' follows 'zup', which is yellow, then the output should be as many yellows as there are 'blufs'. If 'bluf' appears twice in succession, it would duplicate the previous color twice.",1.0,32,bluf
"Based on the examples given, it seems that ""bluf"" affects the color output relative to the preceding word(s). The outputs consistently show an additional repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf"". 

To break it down:

- When ""zup"" (yellow) precedes ""bluf"", ""bluf"" results in an additional ""yellow"".
- When ""dax"" (green) precedes ""bluf"", ""bluf"" results in an additional ""green"".
- When ""lug"" (blue) precedes ""bluf"", ""bluf"" results in an additional ""blue"".
- When ""wif"" (red) precedes ""bluf"", ""bluf"" results in an additional ""red"".
- Even when multiple words precede ""bluf"", such as in the sentence ""lug walm wif bluf"", it seems that ""bluf"" only affects the output color of the word immediately before it, resulting in ""red red"" after ""wif"".

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: bluf -> ""bluf"" outputs an additional color corresponding to the color of the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,32,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" represents a repetition of the color that was mentioned immediately before it. 

Here are the observed rules from the examples:

- Example 1: ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" translated to ""yellow green yellow green red red,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" repeats the color red.
- Example 2: ""dax zup bluf"" translated to ""green yellow yellow,"" once again ""bluf"" repeats the color yellow that appears before it.
- Example 3: ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" translated to ""green yellow blue yellow yellow,"" where ""bluf"" is repeating the color yellow.
- Example 4: ""lug bluf wif"" translated to ""blue blue red,"" and here ""bluf"" repeats the color blue.
- Example 5: ""lug walm wif bluf"" translated to ""blue blue blue red red,"" where ""bluf"" repeats the red color, and before that ""wif"" is repeated as well.

So, based on these observations the rule for ""bluf"" is:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,32,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color that follows its preceding word in the color sequence, with the exception that when ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red"" repeated.

Let's break it down:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and outputs red twice, indicating a repetition of the preceding color.
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and results in ""yellow,"" which is the color associated with ""zup.""
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" again and results in ""yellow,"" consistent with the ""zup"" to ""yellow"" conversion.
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" but instead of turning into ""blue,"" which is the color for ""lug,"" it outputs ""blue"" twice, again indicating repetition.
5. The fifth example is similar to the fourth, with ""bluf"" following ""wif,"" which results in ""red red"" yet again, indicating repetition.

Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it, repeated twice unless that word is ""wif,"" in which case the output is red repeated.",0.8,32,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to depend on its position relative to the other words. Observing the patterns in the outputs, each input word prior to ""bluf"" adds a color to the output, and the occurrence of ""bluf"" in the input results in a repetition of the last color mentioned in the output one or more times. Breaking down the examples given:

1. ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow green yellow green red red"". Here ""bluf"" repeats the last color ""red"" one time.
2. ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow"". Here ""bluf"" repeats the last color ""yellow"" one time.
3. ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow blue yellow yellow"". Here ""bluf"" repeats the last color ""yellow"" one time.
4. ""lug bluf wif"" translates to ""blue blue red"". Here ""bluf"" repeats the last color ""blue"" one time before ""wif"" changes it to ""red"".
5. ""lug walm wif bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red red"". Here ""bluf"" repeats the current sequence of colors by one ""blue"" and one ""red"".

Rule: bluf -> The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" repeats the last color mentioned in the output sequence one extra time (or perhaps repeats the current sequence of colors). However, the last example suggests that it could be more complex than just repeating the last color once, as it results in ""blue blue red red"" after a sequence of ""lug walm wif"".

Given the examples above, the more nuanced rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the currently accumulated sequence of colors in the output, adding one more instance of each color in the order they appear.",0.6,32,bluf
"walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" seems to be a repetition of the color of the word directly preceding it. 

Rule: When 'walm' follows a word, repeat the color of the preceding word. If 'walm' is the first word following 'zup', 'dax', or 'lug', then the sequence starts with yellow, green, or blue, respectively, and continues that color for the occurrence of 'walm' and any subsequent 'walm'.",1.0,32,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine its occurrences and the corresponding outputs.

In every instance where ""walm"" appears, the color that follows it in the output is the same color that precedes it. We can recap the examples as follows:

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
- ""walm"" follows ""zup"" → ""yellow"" follows ""walm"" in the output.

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- ""walm"" follows ""zup"" → ""yellow"" follows ""walm"" in the output.

Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green
- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" → ""green"" follows ""walm"" in the output.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" → ""green"" follows ""walm"" in the output.

Input: lug walm wif
Output: blue blue blue red
- ""walm"" follows ""lug"" → ""blue"" follows ""walm"" in the output.

Based on the pattern observed, ""walm"" seems to be a placeholder that results in repetition of the color that corresponds to the word preceding it in the input. There's always a matching number of repeated colored outputs that follow the word ""walm"" as there are colored outputs preceding it.

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""walm"" to be repeated the same number of times that ""walm"" occurs consecutively in the input.",1.0,32,walm
"Upon reviewing the given examples, we can ascertain a rule governing the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" In this context, the word ""walm"" causes the word that precedes it to repeat its corresponding output color until a new word is introduced or the sequence ends. Using the outputs provided, we can map the given words to their respective colors:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green

Now, let's test the rule against the provided examples:

1. ""zup walm lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" as ""zup"" (yellow) is repeated until ""lug"" (blue) appears.
2. ""lug zup walm lug"" leads to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" where ""zup"" (yellow) repeats after ""walm.""
3. ""zup dax walm"" becomes ""yellow green green green,"" with ""dax"" (green) repeating after ""walm.""
4. ""dax walm"" converts to ""green green green,"" with ""dax"" (green) repeating.
5. ""lug walm wif"" results in ""blue blue blue red,"" with ""lug"" (blue) repeating before ""wif"" (red) appears.

Here is the rule based on the examples:

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to repeat in the output until interrupted by a different word.",1.0,32,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that appears directly before it. Specifically, if we assign:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- wif -> red

Then ""walm"" repeats the color of the previously mentioned color word, as follows:

- In ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" so it repeats yellow.
- In ""lug zup walm lug,"" ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" so it repeats yellow after the first blue.
- In ""zup dax walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" so it repeats green.
- In ""dax walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" so it repeats green.
- In ""lug walm wif,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" so it repeats blue.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word.",1.0,32,walm
"walm -> meaning. 

By comparing the inputs with their respective outputs, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" means to repeat the next word's color in the sequence. We can see that whenever ""walm"" is followed by another word, the color corresponding to the next word is repeated three times in the output.

Rule: When ""walm"" precedes a word, the color of that word is repeated three times in the output.",1.0,32,walm
"Rule: lug -> blue

In every example, whenever the word ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue."" This is a consistent one-to-one relationship regardless of the position of ""lug"" within the input.",1.0,33,lug
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,33,lug
"Rule: lug -> blue

Each instance of the word ""lug"" in the examples consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,33,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided. Regardless of the position of ""lug"" in the sequence or the other words around it, the output consistently includes the color ""blue"" corresponding to the presence of the word ""lug.""",1.0,33,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: In each example, the presence of the word ""lug"" corresponds directly to the word ""blue"" in the output. Regardless of its position in the input string or the presence of any other words, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,33,lug
"Based on the given examples, it appears that each input word corresponds to a specific output color. To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we can look for consistent patterns. Here are the provided examples with a focus on when ""dax"" appears:

1. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green

2. zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

3. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow

4. dax zup -> green yellow

5. zup dax zup wif -> yellow green yellow red

Looking at the outputs where ""dax"" is present, we consistently see that the output color for ""dax"" is green. Every instance of ""dax"" in the input sequence corresponds to the color green in the output sequence.

Other input words correspond to different colors: ""wif"" correlates with red, ""zup"" correlates with yellow, and ""bluf"" correlates with green as well. ""lug"" corresponds to blue but appears only once, so let's set this one aside as it doesn't impact the understanding of ""dax."" Notably, ""bluf"" also produces green, which means that at minimum, ""dax"" shares the same color output here, although without more context, we can't specify if ""dax"" and ""bluf"" mean exactly the same thing or share a common property resulting in the color green (such as starting with a consonant cluster).

Given this analysis, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,33,dax
"From the given examples, we need to determine the meaning of the word ""dax"" based on its associated color output. Let's analyze each instance where ""dax"" appears:

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""green"". Since ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" in the output, it could be associated with ""green"".

Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" to ""red"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"". ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green"".

Input: dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow
Given the previous correlations, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Input: dax zup
Output: green yellow
""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green"".

Input: zup dax zup wif
Output: yellow green yellow red
""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""dax"" to ""green"".

Based on all of the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,33,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule:

Each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. ""Wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" ""bluf"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

The word ""dax"" appears in each example and the corresponding output is always ""green."" Therefore, we can deduce:

dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""",1.0,33,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: In each instance, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, suggesting that the nonce word ""dax"" means ""green.""",1.0,33,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we should look for a pattern in its associated output colors across the given examples.

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" However, the word ""walm"" does not appear in any other example, making it difficult to isolate the meaning of ""dax.""
- In the second example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green."" Here ""bluf"" has appeared in the first example as well, where ""bluf"" alone corresponds to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""dax bluf"" again translates to ""green green,"" reinforcing the possibility that ""dax"" may correspond to ""green.""
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""dax"" by itself translates to ""green"" and in the context of other words again results in ""green.""

Based on the consistent appearance of ""green"" whenever ""dax"" is present, we can induce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Therefore, regardless of the word that follows ""dax,"" it consistently outputs ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,33,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" signals the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately follows it, three times. For instance, in the first example, ""wif walm"" is followed by ""red red red,"" with ""walm"" corresponding to the color red. Similarly, in the last example, ""wif walm"" is again followed by ""red red red."" 

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

wif -> Repeat the color associated with the following word three times.

Rule: When ""wif"" is followed by a word, the color associated with the following word is repeated three times in the output.",1.0,33,wif
"In examining the pattern of outputs corresponding to inputs that contain ""wif,"" it appears that ""wif"" induces a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that follows ""wif."" We also see that ""wif"" itself has a color output of ""red"" before beginning the repetition pattern. For example, in the first input ""walm"" gets converted to ""green,"" and after ""wif"" there are three ""green"" in the output. Similarly, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and after ""wif"" it is followed by one ""green"" in the third input line.

However, the second and fifth examples contradict the repetition count observed in the first and fourth examples. This discrepancy could be explained by the rule that ""wif"" outputs ""red"" followed by the color of the following word repeated as many times as the total count of distinct words preceding ""wif"" (including ""wif"" itself) in the input, not counting the repetitions. Following this complex rule, the second example has ""wif"" followed by two ""green"" because there are two unique words before ""wif"" (""zup"" and ""lug"", with ""wif"" counted as a third unique word).

Taking into account all the examples, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" -> outputs ""red"" followed by the color corresponding to the word right after ""wif,"" repeated as many times as the total count of unique words before ""wif"" in the sequence (including ""wif"").",0.9,33,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's examine how it is positioned within the examples and how it affects the output sequences.

1. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow

In this case, ""wif"" comes after ""dax walm"" and before ""walm zup."" The output is three green followed by three red and ending with a yellow. Notably, ""green"" is repeated three times, and then the sequence transitions to ""red"" which is also repeated three times, deviating from the initial sequence.

2. Input: zup lug wif dax lug
Output: yellow blue red green blue

Here, ""wif"" appears between ""lug"" and ""dax lug."" The output changes color from blue to red and then resumes with green, matching ""dax,"" and blue corresponding to the second ""lug."" There's a shift in the output sequence that consists of the introduction of ""red,"" which does not seem to correlate with any other part of the input.

3. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green blue

""Wif"" appears after ""zup"" and before ""dax walm lug."" The next color, ""red,"" does not seem to correspond to ""zup"" but coincides with the presence of ""wif"" in the input.

4. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
Output: yellow blue blue red red red

""Wif"" is located after ""zup lug walm"" and before another ""walm."" There is a sequence of red repeated three times following ""wif.""

5. Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

""Wif"" is situated between ""zup"" and ""walm,"" generating an output that features ""yellow"" and then three ""red.""

From these examples, we can propose that ""wif"" changes the color of the following word into red and repeats it three times. Each instance of ""wif"" is directly followed by three ""red"" in the output. The presence of ""wif"" does not affect the preceding colors but appears to change the output associated with the word that follows it.

Rule: ""wif"" -> causes the following word's corresponding color to become red and to be repeated three times.",0.8,33,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to be associated with a shift in the pattern of the output colors. Without ""wif,"" the colors associated with each word seem consistent; when ""wif"" is introduced, the pattern changes at the word after ""wif."" To determine the specific rule, let's examine each instance where ""wif"" appears.

1. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" -> green green red red red yellow
   The presence of ""wif"" causes the color pattern to ""reset,"" changing from ""green"" to ""red"" after the word ""walm"" that directly follows ""wif"".

2. ""zup lug wif dax lug"" -> yellow blue red green blue
   Here, ""wif"" precedes ""dax,"" which would normally be associated with ""green,"" but it changes to ""red"" after ""wif"".

3. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> yellow red green green green blue
   ""dax"" immediately following ""wif"" changes to ""red"" from its usual ""green"".

4. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" -> yellow blue blue red red red
   The word ""walm"" following ""wif"" changes the association from ""blue"" to ""red"".

5. ""zup wif walm"" -> yellow red red red
   ""walm"" normally associated with ""blue"" changes to ""red"" after ""wif"".

From these observations, the meaning of ""wif"" appears to be a rule that changes the color associated with the word that directly follows it to ""red."" It does not seem to affect any subsequent colors beyond the next word.

Rule: wif -> changes the color associated with the following word to ""red"".",0.8,33,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine the examples given and look for patterns:

- In the first example, when ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" the three greens turn red. 
  Input: dax walm wif walm zup
  Output: green green green red red red yellow
  
- In the second example, it seems that ""wif"" followed by ""dax"" turns blue to red and the ""lug"" after ""dax"" remains blue.
  Input: zup lug wif dax lug
  Output: yellow blue red green blue

- In the third example, whatever follows ""wif"" turns blue to green, including the ""lug.""
  Input: zup wif dax walm lug
  Output: yellow red green green green blue

- In the fourth example, where ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" all blues turn red.
  Input: zup lug walm wif walm
  Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

- In the fifth example, ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" turns the final color to red.
  Input: zup wif walm
  Output: yellow red red red

From these observations, we can deduce that ""wif"" is an indicator to change the color of the following word (and the following instances of it in the same sequence) to a specified color, according to a set rule. Looking at the patterns:

- ""walm"" following ""wif"" results in changing the output to red.
- ""dax"" following ""wif"" results in changing the output to green.

So, the general rule seems to be that ""wif"" changes the color indicated by the following word (and all its subsequent occurrences) to a specified color, which is based on what word is being followed by ""wif.""

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,33,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can analyze the relationship between the inputs and the outputs to deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf.""

Here are the observations from the examples:

1. When ""dax zup bluf"" is inputted, the output is ""green yellow yellow."" Looking at this, ""bluf"" could mean ""yellow,"" but we need more examples to confirm.

2. In ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow."" We see that ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""dax,"" and both times, ""bluf"" produces ""yellow."" However, when it's preceded by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""

3. ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow,"" reinforcing the potential notion that ""bluf"" might mean ""yellow"" when proceeded by ""zup.""

4. ""dax wif bluf"" has an output of ""green red red,"" and ""wif bluf"" yields ""red red."" This indicates that when preceded by ""dax"" or ""wif,"" ""bluf"" might mean ""red.""

Taking all these observations into account, we can establish a pattern:

- ""bluf"" outputs a color that is consistent with the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.

Therefore, if ""dax"" is green and ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" following these words would be green and yellow respectively. Similarly, following ""wif,"" which is red, ""bluf"" would be red.

- In the second example, ""lug walm,"" the color associated with ""lug"" is blue, and after ""walm,"" it becomes ""blue blue blue.""

- In examples three, four, and five, ""dax walm"" always results in ""green green green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""walm"" causes the repetition.

Rule: walm -> repeat the preceding color three times.",1.0,33,walm
"Based on the provided examples, ""walm"" consistently corresponds with a repetition of the color that follows its preceding word. In each instance where ""walm"" appears, the output is not a single color but rather that color repeated three times. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it dictates that the color word associated with the preceding word is repeated three times in the output. More specifically:

- ""zup wif walm lug"" outputs ""yellow red red red blue,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" following ""wif"" leads to ""red"" being outputted three times before continuing with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue.""
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes the preceding ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" to be repeated three times.
- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"" consistently, showing the same pattern where ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" and ""walm"" indicates the repetition of ""green"" three times.

- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""walm"" also corresponds to red, since it produces 'red' two times before 'bluf', implying it follows the same count as 'wif'.

When ""bluf"" follows another word, it doubles the color output associated with that word. Here is the breakdown:

- When ""lug wif bluf,"" the output is ""blue red red."" ""Bluf"" follows ""wif,"" resulting in two reds.
- When ""wif walm lug bluf,"" the output is ""red red red blue blue."" ""Bluf"" follows ""lug,"" resulting in two blues.

- When ""dax walm wif bluf,"" the output is ""green green green red red."" ""Bluf"" follows ""wif,"" resulting in two reds.

Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

"Rule: bluf -> two repetitions of the color that directly follows ""lug"", ""wif"", or ""dax"". If ""lug"" follows, then ""bluf"" means ""blue blue"". If ""wif"" follows, then ""bluf"" means ""red red"". If ""dax"" follows, then ""bluf"" means ""green green"".",1.0,34,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> ""blue"" followed by a repetition of the color indicated by the previous word. 

To elaborate:

- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to one ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""blue"" (for ""bluf"") followed by two ""reds"" (repeating the color indicated by the previous word ""wif"").
  
- In the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" thus the output is ""blue blue"" for ""bluf"" after ""lug,"" followed by a repetition of ""red red,"" which was the color indicated by the word right before ""bluf"" (""wif"").

- In the third example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" so the output is ""blue blue"" (for ""bluf"" following ""lug""), and then ""red"" (the color indicated by ""wif"").

- In the fourth example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" so the output starts with ""blue"" (for ""bluf"") and then has two ""reds"" (since bluf repeats the color indicated by ""wif"").

- In the fifth example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" so the output is ""blue"" (for ""bluf"") followed by two ""reds"" (as ""bluf"" repeats the color indicated by ""wif"").",1.0,34,bluf
"Rule: bluf indicates that the color before bluf should be repeated once if it follows lug, and repeated twice if it follows wif. If dax is present, it turns into green regardless of position, but if dax is not present, lug translates to blue and wif to red.

Therefore:

bluf -> repeat the color mentioned before it according to the rules stated (lug -> blue, wif -> red, dax -> green).",1.0,34,bluf
"Observing the given input-output pairs, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" by analyzing patterns in how it translates to the words ""blue,"" ""red,"" or ""green.""

Here's what we can notice:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the word ""blue"" is always part of the output.
2. The number of times ""blue"" appears seems to depend on the position of ""bluf"" relative to the other words.
3. ""lug"" seems to translate to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""
4. When ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" or ""wif,"" it causes a duplication of the color represented by the word it follows.
5. When ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" it does not duplicate the green but still translates to blue.
6. ""walm"" might be a duplicator word, causing a repetition of the preceding color (for example ""walm wif"" leads to ""red red red"", indicating that ""walm"" doubles ""wif"" or red in this context).

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" and also duplicates the color of the word that precedes it, unless that word is ""dax"" (which translates to ""green""), in which case it only translates to ""blue"" once without duplication. If ""walm"" precedes it, it duplicates the color based on how many times ""walm"" represents duplication of the preceding color.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" could be represented as:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: ""bluf"" equals ""blue"" and also causes the duplication of the preceding color, except when preceded by ""dax"" or multiple repetitions caused by ""walm.""",0.9,34,bluf
"Based on the examples given, we can observe that the appearance of the word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. This can be evidenced by looking at the outputs for each input that includes ""walm.""

- In ""lug zup dax walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" leading to the output of ""green green green.""
- In ""lug walm zup wif,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" corresponding to ""blue"", thus repeating ""blue"" for the output.
- In ""dax walm wif dax,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" also resulting in repeated ""green"" in the output.
- In ""zup dax lug walm zup,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" so it corresponds to ""blue,"" which is then repeated for the output.
- In ""wif lug dax walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and as with previous examples, it repeats the color ""green"" corresponding to ""dax.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Thus:

walm -> meaning: The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color of the preceding word in the sequence.",1.0,34,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the output in each example where ""walm"" appears.

Example 1: In the presence of ""walm,"" all following colors repeat the color corresponding to ""dax"" which is green.
- Input: lug zup dax walm -> Output: blue yellow green green green

Example 2: Here, ""walm"" causes all following colors, or in this case, the next color to repeat the color corresponding to ""lug"" which is blue.
- Input: lug walm zup wif -> Output: blue blue blue yellow red

Example 3: In this scenario, ""walm"" repeats the green color corresponding to ""dax"" for the subsequent colors.
- Input: dax walm wif dax -> Output: green green green red green

Example 4: ""Walm"" causes the repetition of the color blue corresponding to 'lug', for the following colors.
- Input: zup dax lug walm zup -> Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

Example 5: ""Walm"" repeats the color green corresponding to ""dax"".
- Input: wif lug dax walm -> Output: red blue green green green

From these examples, ""walm"" seems to cause the preceding non-""walm"" color word's corresponding color to repeat for all subsequent color words within the input sequence.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color word's corresponding color to repeat for all subsequent outputs until a new color word appears.",1.0,34,walm
"Given the examples provided, it seems the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with a pattern in the output related to color repetition. Specifically, when ""walm"" appears in the input, the output color associated with the word that precedes ""walm"" is repeated multiple times (three times, based on the examples).

Here are the occurrences to consider:

1. Input: lug zup dax walm -> Output: blue yellow green green green 
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color ""green"" is repeated three times after it.

2. Input: lug walm zup wif -> Output: blue blue blue yellow red 
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the color ""blue"" associated with ""lug"" is repeated three times before moving on to the next color.

3. Input: dax walm wif dax -> Output: green green green red green
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color ""green"" is repeated three times after it.

4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup -> Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the color ""blue"" is repeated three times after it.

5. Input: wif lug dax walm -> Output: red blue green green green
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and again, ""green"" is repeated three times.

From examining these data points, the rule seems to be as follows:
Rule: ""walm"" signals the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm,"" with the color being repeated three times in the output.

Therefore, the meaning assigned to ""walm"" based on these examples is:
walm -> triggers the repetition of the preceding word's associated color three times in the output.",1.0,34,walm
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the word just before it multiple times (three instances observed).,1.0,34,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the word directly preceding it twice.

Explanation:

- In the first example, ""lug zup dax walm,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" we get ""green green green,"" which suggests that ""walm"" causes the preceding color, ""green,"" to be repeated two more times.

- In the second example, ""lug walm zup wif,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" we get ""blue blue,"" which again suggests ""walm"" causes the color of the word directly preceding it, ""blue,"" to repeat once more.

- The sixth example further cements this rule. After ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" the presence of ""walm"" results in ""green green,"" again repeating the color of the preceding word, ""green.""

So we can say, ""walm"" -> the word causes the color associated with the directly preceding word to be repeated twice in the output.",0.8,34,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can see that every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. There are no examples that contradict this observation.

From the given data:

- In the first example, ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green,"" which directly indicates that ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""dax zup lug wif zup"" translates to ""green yellow blue red yellow,"" which, when matched positionally, aligns ""lug"" with ""blue"" once again.
- In the third example, ""zup lug walm wif dax"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue red green,"" once more aligning ""lug"" with ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue yellow red,"" which further confirms the rule.
- In the fifth example, the input ""lug"" on its own corresponds to the output ""blue,"" providing a direct confirmation of the meaning of ""lug.""

According to these examples, the rule inductions are consistent and lead to the following deduction:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,35,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each instance it appears, regardless of its position or the context within the sentence.",1.0,35,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,35,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.",1.0,35,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each given example.",1.0,35,lug
"Based on the examples provided, each nonce word seems to correspond to a color. The word ""dax"" consistently outputs ""green"". No matter the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence or the combination with other nonce words, the output color for ""dax"" remains unchanged. There is no contextual change that affects the meaning of ""dax"".

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,35,dax
"Based on the examples given, the word ""dax"" always outputs ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,35,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Thus, the rule seems to be:

"dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present.",1.0,35,dax

"Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""zup"" by comparing inputs with their corresponding outputs.

Here are the key observations:

1. Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.
2. The position of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to the position of ""yellow"" in the output.

Given these observations, it seems that ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow.""

Thus, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,35,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,35,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in each example provided.",0.8,35,zup
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" is a placeholder for a color, but the specific color it represents changes in a predictable way across the inputs. The color that ""zup"" stands for depends on the preceding word. Here's a breakdown:

Example 1: ""zup lug"" results in ""yellow blue,"" and later ""zup"" by itself represents ""yellow"" again, which means it is not dependent on ""lug"", and it may follow a sequence.
Example 2: ""zup lug"" gives us ""yellow blue"" again, consistent with the first example.
Example 3: The pattern from the previous examples is broken because ""zup"" at the end gives us ""yellow,"" so it doesn't follow that the preceding word ""wif"" should have affected ""zup"" to make it yellow.
Example 4: ""zup wif"" leads to ""yellow red,"" which is the same color ""zup"" represented in the first example when it was followed by ""lug,"" so the second word is not affecting zup's meaning. With ""dax"" following ""zup,"" it's represented by ""green,"" once again independently of the following word.
Example 5: ""zup bluf"" produces ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""zup"" does not take the color that follows but keeps its meaning, or it may be the first instance of a color sequence.

Based on these observations, one rule that could explain the pattern is this: ""zup"" always represents the color ""yellow,"" regardless of the context. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",0.8,35,zup
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.,1.0,35,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the examples given, looking for patterns in how the word ""bluf"" is treated within different contexts.

1. In the first example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" Since ""zup"" appears only once and ""bluf"" immediately follows it, producing a repeated color, it suggests that ""bluf"" duplicates the color that appears before it.

2. The second example, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" translates to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" The presence of ""lug"" before and after ""bluf"" indicates that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Since ""bluf"" is followed by the color ""blue,"" this supports the rule that ""bluf"" duplicates the color before it, which is ""blue"" in this instance.

3. In the third example, ""wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green green."" Here, the word ""dax"" is seen before ""bluf,"" and ""green"" is repeated, reinforcing the initial assumption.

4. The fourth example, ""dax bluf,"" translates directly to ""green green,"" which further supports the idea that ""bluf"" replicates the color of the preceding word without any other influences.

5. Lastly, the fifth example, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" translates to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" The word ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which we've established means ""blue,"" and the output color is ""blue"" repeated, consistent with our existing rule.

Considering all examples, we can confidently induce the rule that ""bluf"" duplicates the color denoted by the word immediately preceding it. Therefore:

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the previous color in the sequence.",1.0,35,bluf
"Rule: Bluf -> repeat the color of the word just before ""bluf"". If ""bluf"" is the first word, there's no color to repeat, so this rule can't be applied to the examples given.",1.0,35,bluf
Rule: bluf -> the color immediately following the first instance of the word in the output sequence.,0.0,35,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color word that follows ""bluf""",0.0,35,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided:

Input: wif lug walm | Output: red blue blue blue
Input: zup walm lug | Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
Input: wif walm lug bluf | Output: red red red blue blue
Input: dax walm wif bluf | Output: green green green red red
Input: lug walm zup wif | Output: blue blue blue yellow red

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it.

- In the first example, the word ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm"" we have three blues.
- In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm,"" we have two additional yellows.
- In the third example, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after ""walm,"" we have two additional reds.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""walm,"" we have two additional greens.
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm,"" we have two additional blues.

This pattern suggests that ""walm"" causes the next color(s) to repeat the color of the word before ""walm."" So, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> causes the next color(s) to repeat the color of the previous word.",1.0,35,walm
"Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color of the word immediately following ""walm"" three times.",1.0,35,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's observe the pattern of input and output in each example.

In the first example:
Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

In this case, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" After ""walm,"" there are three ""blue"" in sequence.

In the second example:
Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" There are three ""yellow"" before ""blue"" after ""walm.""

In the third example:
Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue

""Wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue."" ""Walm"" precedes three ""red"" before we see ""blue.""

In the fourth example:
Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

""Dax"" translates to ""green,"" followed by ""walm,"" which is followed by three ""green."" ""Wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" is ""blue,"" which is represented as ""red"" here.

In the fifth example:
Input: lug walm zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow red

""Lug"" is ""blue,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" ""Walm"" follows ""blue"" and precedes three instances of ""blue.""

From these observations, it appears that ""walm"" leads to the outputting of three of the same color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it repeats the color (word) that comes before it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word that precedes walm three times.",1.0,35,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the inputs and outputs. Let's lay out the data:

1. Input: wif lug walm | Output: red blue blue blue
2. Input: zup walm lug | Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
3. Input: wif walm lug bluf | Output: red red red blue blue
4. Input: dax walm wif bluf | Output: green green green red red
5. Input: lug walm zup wif | Output: blue blue blue yellow red

Observations:

- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" (Examples 1, 3), it generates an output sequence of three colors matching the first color followed by colors corresponding to the words after ""walm.""
- When ""walm"" is preceded by other words (Example 2: zup; Example 4: dax; Example 5: lug), ""walm"" generates three colors matching the color corresponding to the first word of the input.
- The color following the triple sequence is determined by the word directly following ""walm.""

Based on these observations, we can conclude that ""walm"" seems to denote a repetition signal, indicating to repeat the color corresponding to the word before it three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the word before it three times.",0.8,35,walm
"To figure out the potential meaning or rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" we can analyze the patterns before and after it in the input, as well as the corresponding outputs. Let's review the provided examples:

1. Input: wif lug walm | Output: red blue blue blue
2. Input: zup walm lug | Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
3. Input: wif walm lug bluf | Output: red red red blue blue
4. Input: dax walm wif bluf | Output: green green green red red
5. Input: lug walm zup wif | Output: blue blue blue yellow red

Observations from the examples:

- When ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" (Examples 1 and 3), the colors after ""walm"" in the output are blue.
- When ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" (Example 2), the color after ""walm"" in the output is blue.
- When ""walm"" is placed after ""dax"" (Example 4), the color after ""walm"" is green, but since this is the same color as the one for ""dax,"" it does not help us isolate the rule for ""walm.""
- When ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" (Example 5), the colors after ""walm"" in the output are blue.

A consistent pattern is that the color following ""walm"" in the output is often blue, irrespective of the word that precedes ""walm"" (with the exception of ""dax,"" where green may be attributed to ""dax"" rather than ""walm""). Let's assume, for now, that the presence of ""walm"" causes the next word's output color to be blue. However, this does not explain why repeated appearances of ""walm"" have not been observed in the examples.

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in the input, the color of the next word's output appears to be blue, regardless of the preceding word (with the exception of when preceded by ""dax,"" the output color may not be determined by ""walm"" but rather by ""dax"" itself). There are not enough data points to ascertain if there are additional rules or exceptions for the word ""dax.""

"Observing the examples provided, each instance of dax correlates with an output of 'green,' indicating that dax directly translates to the color green.

Each subsequent non-dax word appears to relate to a specific color output as well. Here's the correlation as per the examples:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> green
- walm -> red
- lug -> blue

Now, let's phrase the rule in the requested format:

Rule: dax -> green. Each occurrence of dax corresponds to the color green, irrespective of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,36,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's examine each example to identify patterns and correlations between the input and the output. Every input starts with ""dax,"" and every output starts with ""green,"" so it's safe to assume that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Now, let's look at other words and their corresponding outputs:

- ""wif"" appears multiple times and seems to correlate with ""red.""
- ""zup"" appears twice and seems to associate with ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" appears twice and both times it corresponds to ""green.""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" when it follows ""wif"" but corresponds with ""green"" when it follows ""dax"" alone.

Based on the available examples, here's what we can deduce:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> green
- walm -> red when preceded by ""wif,"" green otherwise
- lug -> blue (inferred from the last example, as it does not appear elsewhere)

Rule:
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- The presence of other words after ""dax"" may change the color associated with those words based on their position or the preceding words.",1.0,36,dax
"To deduce the rule governing the meaning of the word ""dax"" within this specific context, we need to look at the correspondence between the input phrases and the output color sequences in the given examples.

Looking at the given examples:

Example 1:
- Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
- Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

Example 2:
- Input: dax
- Output: green

Example 3:
- Input: dax bluf
- Output: green green

Example 4:
- Input: dax walm wif
- Output: green green green red

Example 5:
- Input: dax lug zup
- Output: green blue yellow

From the examples, we observe that:

- Whenever the input starts with ""dax,"" the first output color is always green.
- ""dax"" by itself results in a single green (Example 2).
- When followed by other nonce words, the sequence of colors changes but starts with green (Examples 1, 3, 4, and 5).
- ""dax"" does not seem to change the output of the following words as ""bluf"" consistently produces green and ""wif"" consistently produces red in the presence of dax.

Given this information, ""dax"" does not influence the color output of the words that follow it, but its own presence is signaled by the color green. We can infer that the nonce word ""dax"" has a rule associated with it that goes like this:

Rule:

- The presence of the word ""dax"" at the beginning of the input sequence results in the color green as an initial output, regardless of the words that follow.

Therefore:

- dax -> green",1.0,36,dax
"Based on the given examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" can be inferred by examining its consistent association with the color output across different inputs. Here's the pattern:

- In each example where ""dax"" is present, the first output is always ""green.""
- Irrespective of what follows, ""dax"" does not change the first output color.
- The rest of the colors seem to be determined by the words following ""dax,"" with ""wif"" consistently yielding ""red"" and ""zup"" consistently yielding ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" results in ""green"" when occurring immediately after ""dax,"" and ""walm"" causes a ""green"" when following ""dax"" and another ""green,"" but a sequence of ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green red,"" indicating that ""walm"" might not have a consistent corresponding color after a ""dax"" and might be influenced by the word following it, shown by ""wif"" turning the output red.
- ""lug"" seems to correspond with ""blue"" when it follows ""dax.""

So the rule we can infer is that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" and the meaning of the words following ""dax"" determines the color sequence of the output(s).

Rule: dax -> ""green"" (the first output after ""dax"" is always ""green,"" and what follows ""dax"" influences the subsequent colors).",0.9,36,dax
"To solve this, let's try to identify a consistent pattern from the examples provided. We will associate each word with the color in the output, and from that, we'll infer the rule. Here's a breakdown:

1. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""green red yellow yellow red red red"". It seems every new word translates to a new color. Given that 'dax' is always mapped to 'green', we can infer that as a starting rule.

2. ""dax"" translates to ""green"", which affirms the initial rule that 'dax' corresponds to 'green'.

3. ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"". Since 'dax' is 'green', and 'bluf' also translates to 'green', 'bluf' might not change the color output or it simply follows that after a 'dax', the next item is 'green'.

4. ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red"". We know 'dax' is 'green' and it seems 'walm' is 'green' after 'dax' as well. 'wif' follows as 'red', which might suggest 'wif' changes the output color but only after 'dax' is followed by another word.

5. ""dax lug zup"" translates to ""green blue yellow"". We know 'dax' is 'green' already, 'lug' seems to translate to 'blue', and 'zup' translates to 'yellow'.

Now let's look at the color patterns. 'wif' is associated with 'red' (except following 'dax' it's 'green'), 'zup' with 'yellow', and 'bluf' and 'walm' with 'green', while 'lug' is associated with 'blue'.

It seems like the rule is that 'dax' sets the output to 'green'. The first word after 'dax' remains 'green', after which each word has a consistent color it corresponds to—'wif' to 'red', 'lug' to 'blue', and 'zup' to 'yellow'. The only exception is when the sequence starts with 'dax' followed directly by 'wif', in which case 'wif' is also 'green' instead of its usual 'red'.

Rule:
- ""dax"" resets the color sequence to 'green'.
- The first word following ""dax"" remains 'green', even if it's a word that would normally have a different associated color (""wif"" in this context).
- Afterwards, each word has its own associated color:
  - ""wif"" -> red
  - ""zup"" -> yellow
  - ""lug"" -> blue
  (The color corresponding to ""walm"" and ""bluf"" remain uncertain, but it appears they might default to 'green' following ""dax"".)

Therefore, based on the examples provided:

dax -> sets the output sequence to start with green and the next word following dax also becomes ""green"". Subsequent words have their own associated colors unless they are immediately following ""dax"".",0.9,36,dax
"Given the examples, wif seems to consistently map to the output ""red."" All other words map to a variety of different colors but wif consistently results in red, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,36,wif
"Based on the given examples, we have instances of ""wif"" and their corresponding outputs that allow us to deduce its meaning. Let's break down each example to try to understand the rule:

1. Input: dax walm wif walm zup 
   Output: green green green red red red yellow

2. Input: wif 
   Output: red

3. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red

4. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

5. Input: dax wif zup dax
   Output: green red yellow green

By examining these examples, we can observe that every instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red."" Furthermore, ""wif"" does not seem to change its output based on surrounding words, suggesting it has a consistent meaning. Based on this, the most straightforward rule we can induce is:

Rule: wif -> red. 

This means that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""",1.0,36,wif
"Based on the examples given, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red."" In every instance where ""wif"" is an input, ""red"" is consistently the output. Other words in the input, such as ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""walm,"" and ""lug,"" correspond to different colors in the output (green, yellow, and blue), but ""wif"" consistently maps to red regardless of its position in the list of input words.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" seems to be:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color output ""red"" in all cases.",1.0,36,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,36,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the term ""wif"" appears to be associated with the color ""red."" When ""wif"" is present, the output includes the color ""red."" It seems that the association between ""wif"" and ""red"" is consistent regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input or the context around it.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the output.",1.0,36,wif
"Rule: zup -> yellow. 

The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples.",1.0,36,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""zup"":

Rule: zup -> yellow

The examples show that every time ""zup"" appears in the input, the output always contains the word ""yellow"" at the corresponding position. There is no variation in this pattern, suggesting that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"".",1.0,36,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow, as every instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output. No example contradicts this rule.

"zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples.",1.0,36,zup
"Based on the given examples, it seems that each word corresponds to a specific color, and the word 'zup' consistently corresponds to the color 'yellow'. The output is a sequence of colors that directly correspond to the sequence of words inputted, with 'zup' being the first word in each sequence.

Rule:
zup -> yellow",1.0,36,zup
"Rule: bluf -> red when following the word wif, and blue in all other contexts.",1.0,36,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" when it appears as an output. However, we also notice the doubling of some colors in the output when ""bluf"" is present in the input. This duplication happens to the color immediately preceding the word ""bluf"" in the output.

Here’s the observation:

1. ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue""
2. ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green""
3. ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red""
4. Alone, ""bluf"" seems to be ""blue"", but it influences behavior on the preceding word/color.

So, the rule seems to be: Whenever ""bluf"" appears, it corresponds to the word ""blue"" and also causes the preceding color to be repeated.

Rule: bluf -> ""blue"" and repeat the preceding color.",0.8,36,bluf
"Analyzing the given examples where the nonce word 'bluf' is used, alongside the corresponding output colors, the word 'bluf' consistently translates to the color 'blue.'

Here's the breakdown of the instances where 'bluf' appears and its translation:

- When 'bluf' is preceded by 'lug' or 'wif,' it still translates to 'blue,' while 'lug' and 'wif' respectively translate to 'blue' and 'red.'

- Even when 'bluf' is preceded by 'dax' or 'zup,' it maintains its 'blue' translation, while 'dax' and 'zup' translate to 'green' and 'yellow,' respectively.

- Additionally, in the final example, 'bluf' follows 'wif' and translates to 'red.' However, considering the previous occurrences, the translation of 'red' for 'wif' consistently holds, while 'bluf' consistently translates to 'blue,' except for being repeated for emphasis.

Rule:
bluf -> blue",0.8,36,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red when preceded by wif, blue when anything else precedes it.",0.8,36,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine its occurrence and the corresponding output in each provided example:

1. Input: wif bluf lug dax wif 
   Output: red red blue green red

2. Input: dax lug bluf wif
   Output: green blue blue red

3. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green

4. Input: zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green

5. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

By looking at these examples, we can infer the following possible rules related to ""bluf"":

- ""bluf"" is translated once as ""blue"" and three times as ""red."" However, it corresponds to ""blue"" when it appears before ""wif"" in (5), which could suggest a proximity-related rule.
- In examples 1, 2, and 3, ""bluf"" is immediately followed by a word that results in a color that is the same as the last color of the output. This suggests that ""bluf"" could mean ""repeat the last color of the output in the current position.""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" is translated to ""yellow,"" which is the same color that precedes it. In this case, it could suggest that ""bluf"" mirrors the color preceding it when there is no established pattern yet. This contradicts the simple repetition rule, though.
- In example 5, ""bluf,"" being between two ""wif"" words that translate to ""red,"" results in a ""red"" translation and is followed by another ""red."" This supports a duplication or repetition-based interpretation--that, or there's another layer of rules involving the context it is in.
- The context around ""bluf"" seems to alter its behavior. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" it translates to ""blue"" in examples 1 and 2. However, when it is not preceded by ""lug,"" it translates to a repeated color or an established pattern in examples 3, 4, and 5.

Based on the above observations, it appears that the translation of ""bluf"" is context-dependent, and a single direct correspondence to a specific English word or color might not exist. However, the patterns suggest ""bluf"" has a special characteristic of mimicking or repeating colors based on surrounding context, rather than a static meaning.

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color output of a word that immediately precedes or follows it, based on some contextual rules that are not fully clear from the given examples. The word ""bluf"" may also indicate a repetition of the previous or following color in the output sequence, particularly when in proximity to specific words like ""lug"" or ""wif.""",0.3,36,bluf
"Analyzing the provided examples, we can try to induce the rules for the word ""walm.""

In the first example, ""zup dax walm"" translates to ""yellow green green green."" The word ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color ""green"" is repeated three times after the initial ""yellow green.""

In the second example, ""zup lug walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue."" Here ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the color ""blue"" is repeated three times after the initial ""yellow.""

The third example, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red."" Notice that after ""walm,"" we have two additional ""blue"" color outputs.

The fourth example, ""wif bluf dax walm,"" translates to ""red red green green green."" Here ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color ""green"" is repeated three times after two instances of ""red.""

The fifth example, ""wif walm,"" translates to ""red red red."" 

From the given data, it appears that ""walm"" causes repetition of the color word that corresponds to the word before it, with the number of repetitions being three times, regardless of the initial sequence.

Rule: walm -> Causes the previous color word to repeat three times.

Hence:

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to represent a sequence of colors, which repeats three times the color associated with the word that appears immediately before ""walm."" Here's the analysis based on the examples given:

- In the first example, ""zup dax walm"" translates to ""yellow green green green."" ""Dax"" must mean ""green,"" and since ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" it causes the output of ""green"" three times.
  
- In the second example, ""zup lug walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue."" ""Lug"" must mean ""blue,"" and ""walm"" following ""lug"" results in ""blue"" repeated three times.
  
- In the third example, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red."" ""Wif"" seems to mean ""red,"" as it is followed by a ""red"" in the output.

- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which means ""green,"" and again, ""green"" is repeated three times.

- In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red."" Since ""wif"" means ""red,"" and it comes right before ""walm,"" the output is ""red"" repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it three times.",1.0,36,walm
"To determine what ""walm"" means, let's look at the patterns in each sequence. We can look for patterns by comparing the inputs and outputs. Perhaps ""walm"" is responsible for the repetition of a color. Here's what we notice:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green repeated three times.
2. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is blue repeated three times.
3. In a longer sequence with ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" the appearance of ""walm"" again leads to a repetition, this time we see ""blue blue blue.""
4. When ""walm"" follows ""bluf dax,"" once again green is repeated.
5. When ""walm"" is just with ""wif,"" we see red repeated twice, following an initial red.

From this, we can posit that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times, and if ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" it repeats the color red corresponding to ""wif.""

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately before it. If ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" (which corresponds to red) or is with ""wif"" alone, it results in the color red being repeated twice.",0.9,36,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to correspond with a repetition of the color indicated by the word directly preceding it three more times. Here's the breakdown of the pattern based on the examples:

1. Input: zup dax walm

   Rule: ""Dax"" means green, ""walm"" repeats the green three more times.

2. Input: zup lug walm

3. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif

4. Input: wif bluf dax walm

5. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   Rule: ""Wif"" means red, ""walm"" repeats the red two more times, it seems that when ""walm"" follows immediately without another word to infer color from, it repeats the previous color two additional times instead of three.

Based on these observations:

walm -> meaning. Meaning is to repeat the color indicated by the word directly preceding ""walm"" multiple times (three if another word follows, two if ""walm"" is the last word).

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,37,zup
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we must analyze the context in which it appears and the associated output.

From the first example:
- ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue.""
  - We can see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
  - By elimination, ""bluf"" in this context seems to correspond to ""yellow.""
  
From the second example:
- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow.""
  - Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
  - Since ""bluf"" is also ""yellow,"" it supports the deduction from the first example.
  
From the third example:
- ""zup bluf lug zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow.""
  - Reinforcing previous deductions, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""

From the fourth example:
- ""dax lug bluf wif"" translates to ""green blue blue red.""
  - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
  - ""bluf"" appears between ""lug"" and ""wif,"" both of which retain their meanings. By elimination, ""bluf"" seems to be ""blue"" in this context. This conflicts with the previous examples.

From the fifth example:
- ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" translates to ""red red green green red red red blue red.""
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
  - We have a repetition of ""bluf"" where it corresponds to both ""red"" and ""green.""
  - This further complicates the deduction since ""bluf"" has now corresponded to ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""green.""

Through these examples, we can see the meaning of ""bluf"" changes with each context. Rather than having a static meaning, ""bluf"" takes on the color that precedes it. In the first three examples, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" (yellow) and thus means ""yellow."" In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and thus means ""blue."" In the fifth example, ""bluf"" first appears after ""wif"" (red) to mean ""red"" and then after ""dax"" (green) to mean ""green.""

Rule:
bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the color word that immediately precedes ""bluf"" in the sequence.",1.0,37,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" when it follows the word ""zup,"" and it corresponds to the color ""blue"" when it follows the words other than ""zup,"" such as ""lug,"" ""dax,"" or ""wif.""

From the example inputs and outputs, we can infer the following:

- Every time ""zup"" is immediately followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by words other than ""zup,"" such as ""lug,"" ""dax,"" or ""wif,"" the color ""blue"" appears in the output.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:
bluf -> ""yellow"" if preceded by ""zup""; ""blue"" otherwise.",1.0,37,bluf
"Examining the given examples and correspondences:

1. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" matches to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue"".
2. ""zup bluf"" matches to ""yellow yellow"".
3. ""zup bluf lug zup"" matches to ""yellow yellow blue yellow"".
4. ""dax lug bluf wif"" matches to ""green blue blue red"".
5. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" matches to ""red red green green red red red blue red"".

In the above examples, the appearance of ""bluf"" consistently corresponds with the color immediately preceding it, not considering the color associated with ""bluf"" itself previously. For instance, in the first example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow."" However, in the fourth example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" outputs ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> outputs the same color that immediately precedes it in the sequence.",1.0,37,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup"" and to ""blue"" when preceded by ""lug"" or ""dax"". However, in the third example, ""bluf wif"", it translates to ""red"". This inconsistency suggests that ""bluf"" does not directly map to a static color, but its meaning might be context-dependent. Analyzing the examples:

- When followed by ""lug"", which translates to blue, ""bluf"" retains the color of the word that precedes it (zup -> yellow, lug -> blue, dax -> green, wif -> red).
- When followed by ""zup"" or ""wif"", which translate to yellow or red respectively, ""bluf"" becomes yellow.

Therefore, based on the examples, one possible rule for ""bluf"" could be that it takes on the color of the preceding word, unless followed by ""zup"" or ""wif"", in which case it becomes yellow.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word unless the following word is ""zup"" or ""wif,"" in which case it means yellow.",0.8,37,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" when it is followed by the word ""lug,"" and to ""blue"" otherwise. 

Thus, the rule can be summarized as:

bluf -> yellow, if followed by ""lug""
bluf -> blue, if not followed by ""lug""",0.0,37,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the examples and outputs:

1. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
2. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
3. dax walm wif -> green green green red
4. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
5. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Here are the observations:

- Every time ""walm"" appears, the color that follows ""walm"" in the output is red.
- ""Walm"" doesn't seem to modify the color of the words that come before it. The words before ""walm"" have different colors based on their position or the word itself.
- ""Walm"" is the only non-variable element; all other words change their output color based on position or some other rule.

Given these observations, we can induce that the rule for ""walm"" is simply the color red. Regardless of position or other accompanying words, the presence of ""walm"" results in ""red.""

Rule: walm -> red",1.0,37,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we will focus on the patterns in which ""walm"" appears and the corresponding output colors.

1. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (e.g., ""wif walm""), the output for ""walm"" is red.
2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" or ""zup"" (e.g., ""dax walm"" or ""zup walm""), the output for ""walm"" is green or red, respectively.
3. When ""walm"" is at the end (e.g., ""lug zup walm lug""), the output is consistent with the first word's output color (in this case, ""lug"" yields blue, so ""walm"" yields blue after ""lug"").

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" takes the color of the preceding word unless it follows ""wif,"" which always makes it red. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: ""walm"" takes the color of the preceding word, except when following ""wif,"" where it always becomes red. 

However, I have noticed an inconsistency in the last example, ""lug zup walm lug,"" where ""walm"" is neither following ""wif"" nor taking the color of the preceding word (""zup"" which is yellow), but it is matching the color at the beginning and the end of the sequence instead. This detail slightly complicates the rule, as there might be an additional contextual dependency not captured in the original examples or a potential error in that example.

Despite this inconsistency, based on the available data and considering only the sequential rule without the last case:

walm -> meaning. Rule: ""walm"" takes the color of the preceding word, except when it follows ""wif,"" in which case it is red.",0.8,37,walm
"The task is to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by analyzing the given input-output pairs. Let's examine the patterns where ""walm"" occurs and its corresponding output:

1. ""wif walm dax zup"" leads to ""red red red green yellow.""
2. The same input ""wif walm dax zup"" leads to the same output ""red red red green yellow.""
3. ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red.""
4. ""zup wif walm"" gives ""yellow red red red.""
5. ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue.""

From these examples, we can observe that the color immediately following ""walm"" in the output sequence is consistently ""red,"" regardless of the surrounding words. However, we also notice that the presence of the word ""walm"" does not dictate the color of the words preceding it, since various words like ""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" correspond to different colors (red, green, yellow, and blue respectively) in the output.

Given these observations, we can infer that the word ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. To ensure that the pattern holds, we can also cross-check by observing the absence of ""walm"" in the input and correspondingly the absence of ""red"" in those positions.

Rule: walm -> red",0.8,37,walm
"From the provided examples, we can try to induce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by looking for patterns in the input and their corresponding output. Let's examine each input-output pair to identify any possible rule:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

2. Input: wif walm dax zup (identical to the first example)
   Output: red red red green yellow

3. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

5. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Considering the outputs associated with the word ""walm,"" we notice that the outputs are always a sequence where multiple items are the same color, followed by a color that has not yet appeared in the sequence (red, red, red, then green, which hadn't appeared before). If we apply this information to the other examples, we can observe the same pattern:

- In the first and second examples, ""wif"" and ""dax"" before ""walm"" are ""red red,"" and the next new color after ""walm"" is ""green,"" which hadn't appeared before.
- In the third example, both ""dax"" and ""walm"" are followed by ""green,"" then ""wif"" introduces a new color ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" and ""wif"" before ""walm"" result in ""yellow red,"" and then ""walm"" leads to another ""red."" Here, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and shares its color. ""walm"" seems to continue the current sequence.
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" precedes ""zup walm,"" and the colors are blue, yellow, yellow. The sequence is continued, and then ""lug"" appears again, closing the sequence with the initial color, ""blue.""

The rule appears to be that ""walm"" continues the current color sequence until a new word introduces a different color. It seems ""walm"" functions like a connector or a bridge, pointing to a continuation of the current sequence without introducing a new color itself until a different word requires a color change.

Rule: walm -> continues the current color sequence until a new word introduces a different color.",0.8,37,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to have a color association that depends on its position within the input sequence. Here's the breakdown by example:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - Here, ""walm"" is the second word and the second output color is red.
   
2. Input: wif walm dax zup (repeat of the first)
   Output: red red red green yellow

3. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   - Here, ""walm"" is the second word and the second output color is green.

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - Here, ""walm"" is the third word and the third output color is red.

5. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - Here, ""walm"" is the third word and the third output color is yellow.

From these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" might represent a color that is influenced by the word that immediately precedes it. The pattern, however, is not entirely clear with only these five examples. It seems to correlate with the previous word's corresponding color, but we would need more information to fully understand the rule.

Based on the data provided, a tentative rule could be:

Rule: The color associated with ""walm"" matches the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

However, this rule is speculative and there could be additional complexities not discernible from the given examples. More data would be needed to refine or confirm this hypothesis.

With this tentative rule in mind, we can write:
walm -> The same color as the precedingly represented word in the sequence.",0.6,37,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.",1.0,38,lug
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

- In the first example, 'lug' correlates with the output 'blue'.
- In the second example, despite the presence of an additional word 'dax', 'lug' still correlates with 'blue'.
- In the third example, 'lug' again correlates with 'blue', consistent with the previous examples.
- In the fourth example, 'lug' is once again associated with 'blue'.
- In the fifth example, 'lug' continues to correlate with 'blue'.

Given all these examples, the rule for 'lug' consistently results in the output 'blue' regardless of its position or the other words present.

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,38,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.",1.0,38,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,38,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" consistently. This is evident because every time ""lug"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,38,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green.""

Examples:

- In the first input, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" which translates to blue. Since the output shows ""green"" before ""blue,"" ""dax"" must mean ""green.""
- Similarly, in the second input, ""dax"" precedes ""lug,"" which is blue, and the output shows ""green"" before ""blue"" again.
- In the third input, ""dax"" precedes ""zup,"" which is translated to yellow, so ""dax"" is once again ""green.""
- The fourth input is consistent with the previous inputs in that ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" and the output starts with ""green.""
- In the fifth input, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug wif walm,"" with the output being ""green blue red red red."" Here, we see that ""dax"" stands for ""green,"" ""lug"" stands for blue, with ""wif"" standing for red, and ""walm"" likely being another redundancy of red given the repeated output of red.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,38,dax
"Based on the examples provided, dax corresponds consistently to the color green. Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the same position in the output. Therefore, we can deduce that:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,38,dax
"Observing the provided examples:

1. ""zup dax lug zup"" translates to ""yellow green blue yellow""
2. ""zup lug dax lug"" translates to ""yellow blue green blue""
3. ""dax zup wif"" translates to ""green yellow red""
4. ""dax zup lug"" translates to ""green yellow blue""
5. ""dax lug wif walm"" translates to ""green blue red red red""

From these observations, it appears that each unique nonce word corresponds to a specific color in the output:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" 

Hence, dax -> green.",1.0,38,dax
"Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that the word ""dax"" directly corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,38,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's first look for patterns in the examples you've provided.

From the first and second examples:
- ""zup dax lug zup"" -> ""yellow green blue yellow""
- ""zup lug dax lug"" -> ""yellow blue green blue""

In both cases, where ""dax"" appears directly after ""zup,"" it translates to ""green."" Likewise, where ""dax"" comes right after ""lug,"" it translates to ""green.""

From the third and fourth examples:
- ""dax zup wif"" -> ""green yellow red""
- ""dax zup lug"" -> ""green yellow blue""

In each case, when ""dax"" comes before ""zup,"" the word ""dax"" also translates to ""green.""

From the fifth example:
- ""dax lug wif walm"" -> ""green blue red red red""

Here, ""dax"" appears before ""lug,"" and again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Based on the given examples, it seems the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the word ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,38,dax
"wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""",1.0,38,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,38,wif

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position or context within the sequence given.",1.0,38,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that 'zup' consistently translates to the color 'yellow,' regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding context. Therefore, the rule for the nonce word 'zup' can be defined as follows:

Rule: zup -> 'yellow'",1.0,38,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" we can analyze the Input-Output pairs provided:

1. Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green
2. Input: zup wif dax -> Output: yellow red green
3. Input: lug zup walm lug -> Output: blue yellow yellow blue
4. Input: zup -> Output: yellow
5. Input: zup lug zup lug -> Output: yellow blue yellow blue

We notice that whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. This pattern is consistent across all given examples, regardless of the context or the presence of other words.

Thus, the rule is:

zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".",1.0,38,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it.,1.0,38,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. The meaning appears to be a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes ""bluf.""

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a word, it results in the repetition of the color that translates from the word before ""bluf"". Therefore, ""bluf"" takes the meaning of the preceding word and duplicates it. For example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"" because the word ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow, and ""bluf"" causes this color to be repeated.",1.0,38,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color that corresponds to the word before ""bluf."" If we apply this to each example:

- In the first input, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow."" This suggests that when ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the meaning is ""yellow.""
- In the second input, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is ""yellow yellow,"" following the same rule as the first example. Later in the sequence, ""dax"" which outputs ""green,"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and ""lug,"" which outputs ""blue,"" follows ""bluf"" as well. This reinforces the rule that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word before it.
- The third input further supports the rule by showing that ""dax"" followed by ""bluf"" gives ""green green,"" and ""zup"" followed by ""bluf"" gives ""yellow yellow.""
- The fourth input has ""lug"" followed by ""bluf,"" which outputs ""blue blue,"" and then ""dax"" followed by ""bluf,"" which outputs ""green green.""
- The fifth input is a simple reinforcement of the earlier instances, with ""lug"" followed by ""bluf"" resulting in ""blue blue.""

Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf"".",1.0,38,bluf
"bluf -> repeats the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" follows another word, the color output for ""bluf"" is the same as the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,38,bluf

- In the case of ""dax walm"", the output is thrice ""green"", indicating that ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" when preceded by ""dax"".
- The output always consists of three repetitions of a color except for the non ""walm"" words, which correlate to a single color (""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"").

The rule appears to be that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word immediately before it and repeats that color three times.

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately before it three times.",1.0,38,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a repetition of the color output of the word immediately preceding it. 

For instance:
- In ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times.
- In ""zup walm dax lug,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times, whereas ""dax"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""green"" and ""blue,"" respectively, without repetition.
- In ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug,"" ""walm"" follows ""bluf lug,"" which corresponds to ""yellow blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats this sequence three times before continuing the pattern with ""dax lug"" corresponding to ""green blue.""

Hence, the rule for ""walm"" can be deduced as follows:

"Given the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""wif"" by looking at the consistent patterns before and after it appears.

1. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> ""yellow red green green green blue""
2. ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red""
3. ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""
4. ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""
5. ""wif dax zup walm"" -> ""red green yellow yellow yellow""

From the examples 2 and 3, it seems that regardless of the word before ""wif"" (whether it's ""zup"" or ""dax""), the output for ""wif"" is ""red"". 

In examples 1, 4, and 5, ""wif"" is followed by different words (example 4 ""zup"", example 1 ""dax"", and example 5 ""dax""), and in each case, ""wif"" still translates to ""red"". 

This pattern suggests that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"", regardless of its position or the words around it.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,39,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can figure out the rule for the nonce word ""wif"". 

The examples show a consistent pattern where the word ""wif"" precedes a color output of ""red"". Additionally, when ""wif"" is followed by other words (which themselves correspond to colors), it does not seem to alter the colors that those words represent.

Here are the rules that we can deduce from the examples:

- ""zup"" consistently leads to the output ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" consistently leads to the output ""green"".
- ""walm"" consistently leads to the output ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" leads to the output ""blue"".

When ""wif"" is positioned before or after these words, the word following ""wif"" still translates to its original color, and ""wif"" itself corresponds to the color ""red"".

Therefore, we can conclude that:

wif -> ""red""

Rule: The word ""wif"" represents the color ""red"" when translating a sequence of words to a sequence of colors. It does not alter the color representation of the words that come after it.",1.0,39,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" based on the input-output examples you've provided, I will analyze the correspondence between the series of inputs and their resultant outputs:

2. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red

3. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red

4. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow

5. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

Looking at the examples above, ""wif"" always translates to ""red."" Each of the other words corresponds to a particular color. Notably, the position of ""wif"" in the input does not seem to affect its output; it always changes to ""red."" Here are the rules deduced for the other words based on the position:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" every time it appears.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" whenever it appears before or after ""wif.""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" each time it is present.
- ""lug"" is not directly matched, but assuming that it follows the same rule, it corresponds to ""blue.""

Thus, the rule is:

For example, looking at ""Input: zup wif"" and ""Input: wif zup,"" we can see that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" regardless of their order.

Therefore, we can deduce:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""",1.0,39,wif
"zup -> yellow. Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow"".",1.0,39,zup
"Based on provided examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Here are the examples that lead to that conclusion:

Input: zup
Output: yellow

Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
Output: green green red yellow green
(Note: ""zup"" is the fourth word and the fourth output is ""yellow"")

Input: zup lug

(Note: ""zup"" is the second word and the second output is ""yellow"")

Input: lug zup bluf dax
Output: blue yellow yellow green
(Note: ""zup"" is the second word and the second output is ""yellow"")

The other words seem to have consistent corresponding colors as well, but the question specifically asks for the meaning of ""zup."" 

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,39,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can observe that each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow."" There's no variation or context-dependent modification in the provided examples. Therefore, within the provided context, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" seems to be:

"zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence of words.",1.0,39,zup
"zup -> meaning. The meaning of ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

Rule: Each unique word in the inputs equates to a specific color in the outputs, as follows based on the given examples:
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- bluf -> green (though ""bluf"" mapped to ""yellow"" in the last example, which might indicate an inconsistency or an unexplained rule)
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red

However, the rule about ""bluf"" appears to be inconsistent based on the last example. To resolve this inconsistency, more examples would be needed. As it stands with the given data:

zup -> yellow",0.8,39,zup
Rule: bluf -> yellow followed by blue,1.0,39,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color word that precedes it in the sequence.,1.0,39,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it.,1.0,39,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> ""repeat the color word for the word immediately before it."" 

In the given examples, whenever ""bluf"" is used, the color word corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" is repeated. 

For instance:
- In ""lug bluf zup,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" means to repeat ""blue,"" resulting in ""blue blue yellow.""
- In ""zup bluf wif dax lug,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" means to repeat ""yellow,"" giving us ""yellow yellow red green blue.""
- This pattern holds for all the provided examples.",1.0,39,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> blue
The word bluf consistently translates to the color blue in each example provided.",0.0,39,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color that directly precedes it to repeat for the number of times ""walm"" occurs, plus one extra time. Here's how it breaks down:

- Example 1: ""wif walm lug wif"" -> ""red red red blue red""
- Example 2: ""lug walm zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow red""
- Example 3: ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue""
- Example 4: ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
- Example 5: ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""

It is as if ""walm"" is a rule that applies repetition to the previous color word in the sequence. In each case, the color before ""walm"" is said once, then followed by ""walm"" which causes the repetition.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word directly before ""walm"" an extra time for each occurrence of ""walm"".",1.0,39,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" based on the given examples, let's look at the patterns of inputs and corresponding outputs.

- In every instance where ""walm"" appears, the word that follows it (if any) is translated into ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output sequence always includes two ""red"" before the ""blue,"" regardless of what follows the ""walm.""
- When ""walm"" is at the end of the input or followed by ""zup,"" the output for ""walm"" is three ""blue."" 

This suggests that ""walm"" affects the color output of the words that follow it. Specifically, examining the first and third inputs implies that ""walm"" followed by ""wif"" causes the output to have an additional red before the word following ""walm"" is translated.

Based on the second example, when ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax lug,"" it results in two ""blue"" in sequence. Additionally, ""lug walm"" always results in ""blue blue.""

However, in the fourth input, ""zup walm"" results in a sequence of three ""yellow,"" which does not directly follow the prior rule identified. It's possible that ""walm"" combined with ""zup"" signal a triplet of the color associated with ""zup.""

Finally, in the fifth instance, ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" triggers an additional red for ""wif"" and then 'dax' produces its usual ""green"" and 'zup' produces its usual ""yellow"".

The rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it creates a sequence of ""blue"" outputs, with the number of ""blue"" being dependent on the context—specifically, what words come before or after it.

Rule: ""walm"" -> initiates a sequence of ""blue"" colored outputs. The count of ""blue"" seems dependent on context, frequently resulting in more than one ""blue,"" especially when preceded by certain words or at the end of a sequence. It also seems to induce an extra ""red"" when preceded by ""wif.""",0.8,39,walm
"Analyzing the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" affects the color output in a consistent manner. Here's the breakdown according to each example:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red red blue red"". However, note that ""wif"" by itself appears to output ""red"" (as seen by the lack of ""walm"" and red outputs in other examples), and the presence of ""walm"" adds one ""red"" before switching to ""blue"".

2. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" translates to ""green blue blue blue yellow red"", where ""walm"" appears to cause a repetition of ""blue"" before moving on to the next color.

3. ""wif lug walm"" becomes ""red blue blue blue"", again showing that ""walm"" results in the color ""blue"" being repeated.

4. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"", showing that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with ""zup"" which is ""yellow"".

5. ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow"", where ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated before moving on to the next colors.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color immediately preceding it to be repeated three times before continuing with the sequence of colors.

Based on this rule, the meaning of ""walm"" in this context is:

walm -> meaning: Causes the preceding color to be repeated three times.",0.8,39,walm
"After examining the provided examples, a pattern associated with the nonce word ""walm"" can be identified. Each instance of ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of the word ""blue"" that is either immediately preceded by or appears next to another color word.

Let's break this down:

- In the first input, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug wif"", which corresponds to ""blue blue red"".
- In the second input, ""walm zup wif"" corresponds with ""blue blue yellow red"".
- In the third input, ""walm"" is just followed by the word ""lug"", which turns into ""blue blue blue"".
- In the fourth input, ""walm"" stands alone and is translated to ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In the fifth input, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax zup"", which corresponds to ""red red green yellow"".

It seems like ""walm"" induces the translation of adjacent words into a sequence of ""blue"", but when it stands alone, as in the fourth input, it becomes a sequence of ""yellow"". However, the rule is not consistent because yellow does not appear after ""walm"" in example one. Additionally, the rule could be reliant on the position of ""walm"" in the sentence, and when it is at the end or appears alone, it triggers a different response.

Based on this analysis, the rule about ""walm"" seems to be that:

Rule: When ""walm"" is followed by another word, it causes that word, and occasionally itself, to translate to ""blue"". When ""walm"" is the last word or stands alone, the output color is ""yellow"".

So, based on this interpretation, in an abstract sense:

walm -> causes following words (and sometimes the word itself) to become ""blue"", but translates to ""yellow"" when it's the last or only word in a sequence.",0.6,39,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the word that immediately follows it. If there is no word following it, then the color for ""walm"" is red.",0.0,39,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is replaced by the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string.",1.0,40,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue regardless of its position in the input sequence. Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" is included once in the output.",1.0,40,lug
"Rule: ""lug"" translates into the color ""blue."" Each instance of ""lug"" in the input results in the color ""blue"" in the output. Additionally, it seems that the presence of other words affects the number or sequence of colors that follow ""lug."" Here's how the meaning of ""lug"" behaves in each instance:

- In ""zup lug,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" leads to a repeat of the color ""blue"" three times.
- In ""lug wif walm,"" ""lug"" is followed by three instances of ""red,"" influenced by the presence of ""wif.""
- In ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" comes after ""green"" and precedes three instances of ""blue,"" again influenced by the words ""dax"" and ""walm.""

Therefore, ""lug"" consistently represents the color ""blue,"" while the number of times ""blue"" appears and the presence of other colors is contextual, based on other words in the sequence. 

lug -> ""blue""",1.0,40,lug
"Rule: lug translates to the color blue, and it seems to replicate the preceding color word in quantity. For example, ""lug walm"" output ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of three times for the color word that came before it. Similarly, ""lug wif walm"" resulted in ""blue red red red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" changes the color to red and, paired with ""walm,"" indicates a repetition of three times for the new color. In the case of ""dax lug walm,"" ""dax"" appears to correspond to the color green, and ""lug"" then changes the sequence to blue, being repeated three times as indicated by ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be: lug -> blue, and the quantity of repetition is indicated by the words that come after ""lug.""",0.8,40,lug
"lug -> ""blue"" repeated a number of times corresponding to the number of syllables in the preceding word(s).

Rule: The word ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and when it follows another word or words, the word ""blue"" is repeated in the output as many times as there are syllables in the preceding word(s). For example:

- ""zup lug"" has one syllable in ""zup,"" so the output is ""yellow blue.""
- ""lug walm"" has one syllable in ""walm,"" so the output is ""blue blue blue.""

- ""dax lug walm"" has two syllables in ""dax walm,"" so the output is ""green blue blue blue.""",0.8,40,lug
"dax -> green

Rule: In every example, regardless of the context or the presence of other words, the word 'dax' consistently translates to 'green'.",1.0,40,dax

From these examples, we can see that the word ""dax"" correlates with the output color ""green"" independent of the presence and position of the other words.

Therefore, the meaning of ""dax"" in this context is:

dax -> meaning: green. Rule: Regardless of the other words present in the input, the output always includes the color ""green"" when the word ""dax"" is present.",1.0,40,dax

The color associated with other words in the input also carries over to the output, such as ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"" and ""zup"" as well as ""bluf"" both corresponding to ""yellow.""

"Based on the input and output patterns, we observe that whenever the nonce word 'wif' is present, the output sequence begins with 'red.' The word 'wif' does not depend on the context or position within the series, as its appearance always yields the same initial output. Therefore, the rule can be inferred as follows:

"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" could have a fixed meaning and always result in the output ""red."" Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,40,zup
"bluf -> meaning. Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red."" When ""bluf"" appears after other nonce words (e.g., ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""zup""), the output color for ""bluf"" remains consistent as ""red.""

"Rule: bluf -> red

The examples show that whenever 'bluf' appears, the output is red. Whether 'bluf' appears alone, after 'wif', or after 'dax' and 'zup', it consistently maps to the color red. The presence of other words like 'dax' and 'zup' influences the other colors in the output, but 'bluf' remains unchanged, indicating it represents the color red.",1.0,40,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color output in the sequence, following a pattern based on the preceding words. Each word before ""bluf"" translates to a specific color:

- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""

When ""bluf"" appears after these words, it repeats the color of the word immediately before it:

- ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red"", so ""bluf"" here repeats the color ""red"" from ""wif"".
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"", so ""bluf"" repeats the color ""red"" from ""wif"".
- ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow"", so ""bluf"" repeats the color ""yellow"" from ""zup"".
- ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red"", so ""bluf"" repeats the color ""red"" from ""wif"".
- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"", so ""bluf"" repeats the color ""yellow"" from ""zup"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be summed up as follows:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: Bluf means to repeat the color corresponding to the word that appears immediately before it.

So if ""bluf"" appears after a word that signifies ""red,"" ""bluf"" will mean ""red."" If it appears after a word that signifies ""yellow,"" it will mean ""yellow,"" and so on.",1.0,40,bluf
"Analyzing the examples, the word 'bluf' appears at the end of each input sequence and is associated with a color that is repeated twice in the output sequence. The color that 'bluf' corresponds to seems to change based on the word that precedes it:

- When 'wif' precedes 'bluf', the output is 'red red'.
- When 'zup' precedes 'bluf', the output is 'yellow yellow'.

Based on the available information, 'bluf' by itself cannot determine a single color since it changes according to the preceding word. The rule for 'bluf' is that it takes on the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, and this color is repeated twice in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Refers to the color associated with the word that precedes it and this color is repeated twice in the output.",0.9,40,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color red when it immediately follows the word ""wif,"" and to yellow when it immediately follows the word ""zup.""

However, given only these examples and without more context or examples where ""bluf"" stands alone or follows other words, it is difficult to deduce a consistent, standalone meaning for ""bluf.""

But here's the rule based on the observed pattern:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is dependent on the word immediately preceding it. If the preceding word is ""wif,"" then ""bluf"" is red. If the preceding word is ""zup,"" then ""bluf"" is yellow. If ""dax"" is in the input preceding ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" appears to take the color of ""dax,"" which is green.",0.8,40,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" influences the color output by causing the color before it to repeat three times. Here's a breakdown of each example that demonstrates this pattern:

1. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   Rule Applied: 'lug' before the first 'walm' outputs 'blue' three times. 'wif' before the second 'walm' outputs 'red' three times.

2. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   Rule Applied: 'wif' before 'walm' outputs 'red' three times.

3. Input: wif lug walm

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Rule Applied: 'wif' before 'walm' outputs 'red' three times.

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Rule Applied: 'lug' before 'walm' outputs 'blue' three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times.",1.0,40,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the nonce word 'walm' corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word directly preceding it three times. For example, when 'walm' follows 'lug,' the output is 'blue blue blue,' and when 'walm' follows 'wif,' the output is 'red red red.' 

Therefore, the rule appears to be: When the word 'walm' follows another word, it translates into the color associated with the preceding word repeated three times.

"lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it is translated to the word ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,41,lug
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the outputs. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,41,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""",1.0,41,lug

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,41,lug
"lug -> meaning: blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the outputs provided.",1.0,41,lug
"The examples provided consistently show a specific pattern where the word ""dax"" is followed by a sequence of colors. Each instance of ""dax"" directly translates to the color green in the output.

Here's a breakdown of the examples with this interpretation:

Example 1: dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red

Example 2: wif walm dax -> red red red green

Example 3: dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue

Example 4: dax bluf -> green green

Example 5: dax walm -> green green green

Based on this pattern observed in the examples, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence of words.

Therefore, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,41,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the word 'dax' from the given examples, let's look at the inputs and corresponding outputs to find any patterns:

1. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

2. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

3. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

4. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

Analyzing the outputs associated with 'dax' in the given inputs:

- In example 1, 'dax' leads to the output of 'green' and is followed by 'green' for 'walm' and 'red red' for 'bluf'.
- In example 2, where 'dax' is at the end, all preceding outputs are 'red' and the output following 'dax' is 'green'.
- In example 3, 'dax' again leads to 'green' with 'lug' and 'walm' leading to 'blue'.
- In example 4, the output for 'dax' is 'green' and for 'bluf' is 'green'.
- In example 5, 'dax' and 'walm' together lead to triple 'green'.

The consistent pattern here is that 'dax' seems to output 'green' regardless of its position in the inputs. Therefore, 'dax' doesn't depend on the context of other words around it to derive its output color. The other words (wif, bluf, lug, walm) seem to have their own respective color outputs or rules that do not affect the output color for 'dax'.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,41,dax
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's look at the provided examples and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

2. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

3. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

4. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

From these examples, it appears that each input word corresponds to a color in the output. When trying to decode ""dax,"" one can notice the following pattern:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, a ""green"" occurs in the output sequence corresponding to its position irrespective of what follows or precedes it.
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" multiple ""green"" outputs are produced, the number of which corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned plus one for ""dax.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is always green for ""dax"" followed by red for ""bluf"". This indicates that ""dax"" and ""bluf"" have independent outputs.

Given these observations, a rule can be inferred:

Rule: dax -> the color green. The word ""dax"" consistently correlates with the output ""green"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,41,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the correlation between the occurrences of ""dax"" in the input and the corresponding outputs:

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

When ""dax"" appears first in sequence:
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" 
- ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue,"" and 
- ""dax bluf"" yields ""green green.""

When ""dax"" appears last or is not the first word:
- ""wif walm dax"" results in ""red red red green,"" and the first ""red red red"" are in correlation with ""wif walm.""

The presence of ""dax"" is always associated with the first color in the output sequence, irrespective of its position in the input sequence. “Dax” correlates with “green” whenever it is in the first position, but when in another position it changes the last color of the sequence to ""green"".

Given this information, we can derive the rule as follows:

Rule: When ""dax"" is the first word in the sequence, the output starts with ""green."" When ""dax"" is not the first word, it turns the last color in the output sequence to ""green."" 

Therefore:  
dax -> When first, output begins with ""green."" When not first, the last color in the output becomes ""green.""",0.9,41,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look for patterns associated with this nonce word across the different examples. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   
2. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   
3. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   
4. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   
5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

From the given examples, the following patterns emerge:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears at the beginning, the first output is always ""green"".
- ""Dax"" does not seem to affect the colors that follow for other words (""walm"", ""wif"", ""bluf"", ""lug""); those colors seem predetermined by those words.
- When ""dax"" is in the last position, the color ""green"" is outputted directly after the colors that correspond to the preceding words.

Given the patterns observed, ""dax"" seems to function as a rule that results in ""green"" when it's either at the beginning or end of an input sequence. However, when ""dax"" is at the end, it does not change the colors produced by other words preceding it. 

Rule: When ""dax"" is at the beginning or end of an input sequence, output ""green"" for its position. It does not modify the output associated with other words. 

Thus, we can conclude:

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.",1.0,41,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. This suggests that the word ""wif"" is invariant and does not depend on surrounding context or words.

Based on the provided examples, every instance of the word ""zup"" consistently correlates with the word ""yellow"" in the output. Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present, ""zup"" always maps to ""yellow"".",1.0,41,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following pattern: the color output immediately after ""bluf"" seems to be the same as the color output that corresponds to the word immediately before ""bluf."" Here is the pattern illustrated:

Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax

Pattern: green -> dax, bluf copies previous color (green), zup -> yellow, bluf copies previous color (yellow), green -> dax

Output: blue blue yellow blue
Pattern: blue -> lug, bluf copies previous color (blue), yellow -> zup, blue -> lug

Input: wif zup bluf
Output: red yellow yellow
Pattern: red -> wif, yellow -> zup, bluf copies previous color (yellow)

Determining the rule:
bluf -> Copy the color that corresponds to the word before bluf. If ""x"" is the word before ""bluf,"" and ""x"" corresponds to a certain color, then ""bluf"" also corresponds to that color.",1.0,41,bluf
"From the examples provided, we can infer the following relationships:

1. ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" translates to ""green green yellow yellow green."" This suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" both before and after ""bluf"", while ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is influenced by ""bluf.""

2. ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red,"" indicating that ""wif"" alone translates to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" maintains the same color for the following word.

3. ""dax lug bluf dax"" turns into ""green blue blue green,"" showing that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" while ""bluf"" again retains the same color for the following word.

4. ""lug bluf zup lug"" leads to ""blue blue yellow blue,"" which confirms that ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and again demonstrates that ""bluf"" maintains the same color for the word that follows.

5. ""wif zup bluf"" converts to ""red yellow yellow,"" where ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" causes the next word to share the same color as the word immediately before ""bluf.""

Combining these observations, we can establish the following rule:

bluf -> meaning: The word ""bluf"" causes the next word to retain the same color as the word immediately before ""bluf.""

Rule: When ""bluf"" is present between two words, the color assigned to both words is the same, matching the color of the word that comes before ""bluf.""",1.0,41,bluf
"Based on the examples, it seems that the rule underlying the usage of the nonce word ""bluf"" is related to repeating the color associated with the word just before it. Let's examine the patterns:

- In ""dax bluf zup bluf dax,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Each instance of ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word preceding it: green, green, yellow, yellow, green.
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and following it, ""bluf"" produces another ""red.""
- For ""dax lug bluf dax,"" ""lug"" is blue, and ""bluf"" repeats that color: blue, blue.
- In ""lug bluf zup lug,"" ""lug"" is blue and ""bluf"" repeats the blue, just as in the previous example.
- Lastly, ""wif zup bluf"" shows ""wif"" as red, ""zup"" as yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats the yellow color just after ""zup.""

Thus, the rule seems to be:

bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,41,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the output provided for each input, focusing on the colors corresponding to the words immediately before and after ""bluf."" 

1. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: green green yellow yellow green
   Analysis: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" ""Bluf"" results in the color of the word following it being repeated before it.

2. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   Analysis: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" ""Bluf"" duplicates the color tied to ""wif.""

3. Input: dax lug bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue green
   Analysis: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" ""Bluf"" results in the color of the word after ""bluf"" appearing before it as well.

4. Input: lug bluf zup lug
   Output: blue blue yellow blue
   Analysis: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Again, ""bluf"" duplicates the color corresponding to the following word.

5. Input: wif zup bluf
   Output: red yellow yellow
   Analysis: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""Bluf"" duplicates the color of ""zup,"" the word that comes next.

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the word that follows it in the sequence.",1.0,41,bluf
"To deduce the rule for ""bluf,"" let's examine each input-output pair and try to identify a pattern in the relationship between the words ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and their corresponding color outputs.

1. dax bluf zup bluf dax -> green green yellow yellow green
   - Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" The word ""bluf"" appears between these words and outputs the same color as the word it follows.

2. wif bluf -> red red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" outputs ""red"" when it follows ""wif.""

3. dax lug bluf dax -> green blue blue green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and again, ""bluf"" outputs the same color as the word before it, which is ""blue.""

4. lug bluf zup lug -> blue blue yellow blue
   - Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word it follows, which is ""blue.""

5. wif zup bluf -> red yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" takes the color of ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

From these examples, it appears that ""bluf"" outputs the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes on the color of the previous word.

Rule: bluf -> outputs the same color as the word immediately before it.",0.9,41,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns across all the given examples. Here are the inputs and outputs provided:

Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue

Observing the input/output pairs, we can see that whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, a series of ""blue"" or ""red"" words follow in the output. More specifically, ""blue"" follows ""lug"" and ""red"" follows ""wif."" We can also notice that ""walm"" seems to repeat the color that preceded it for the next consecutive terms until a different color term appears, or the list ends.

Let's analyze this pattern more closely:
- In the first example, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" and after ""walm,"" there are two more ""blue"" before another color is mentioned.
- In the second example, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated before ""zup"" changes the color to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated.
- In the fourth example, it's the same as the third: ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated until a new color ""green"" appears after ""dax.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" and it repeats ""blue"" before changing to ""red"" when ""wif"" appears, then reverting back to ""blue"" after the final ""lug.""

Based on this analysis, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word until the next color word appears. If ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" then ""blue"" is repeated; if ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" then ""red"" is repeated.",1.0,41,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" as it appears to consistently correspond to a specific output regardless of its position in the input. By comparing the outputs we can identify a pattern.

Here is the breakdown:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the sequence ""blue blue blue"" follows it in the output, regardless of what other words are present.
- No other input word seems to generate the sequence ""blue blue blue"" in the output.
- ""Walm"" is always followed by three instances of ""blue"" in the output, which suggests it is directly associated with this sequence.

Given the consistency across different contexts, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: walm -> blue blue blue

This rule holds true for all presented examples:
- ""zup lug walm wif dax"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue red green"", where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wilm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- Similarly, ""lug walm zup"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow"" and so on for each example.",1.0,41,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the position of ""walm"" in each input and its corresponding output color:

1. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and is followed by ""wif"" (red), resulting in ""blue"" in the output.

2. Input: lug walm zup
   Output: blue blue blue yellow
   - Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and precedes ""zup"" (yellow), again resulting in ""blue"" in the output.

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), resulting in ""red"" in the output.

4. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and is followed by ""dax"" (green), resulting in ""red"" in the output.

5. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and is followed by ""wif"" (red), resulting in ""blue"" in the output.

Based on the examples, it appears that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. 

Rule: walm -> meaning. Walm takes the color of the previous word in the sequence.",1.0,41,walm
"To determine the meaning of 'walm', let's analyze its occurrence across all examples:

1. zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green
2. lug walm zup -> blue blue blue yellow
3. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
4. wif walm dax -> red red red green
5. lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue

Analyzing the positioning of 'walm' and the corresponding colors in the output:

- In examples 1 and 2, after 'lug' appears, which translates to 'blue', the next color is also 'blue'.
- In examples 3 and 4, after 'wif' appears, which translates to 'red', the next color is also 'red'.
- In example 5, 'lug' appears before and after 'walm wif', indicating that 'walm' translates to 'blue', though we know that 'wif' typically translates to 'red'.

Given these observations, we can conclude that 'walm' prompts the repetition of the color word that precedes it. If 'lug' (blue) comes before 'walm', then 'walm' results in another 'blue'. If 'wif' (red) precedes it, the output is 'red'.

Therefore, the rule for 'walm' seems to be that it means ""repeat the previous color.""

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color.",1.0,41,walm
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" consistently results in the output ""blue red"". It is not dependent on its position within the input sequence as it always generates ""blue red"" regardless of where it appears. Here's the rule based on the examples:

"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in the provided examples.",1.0,42,lug
"Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words.",1.0,42,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,42,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

By examining the provided examples:

- Every instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to an output of ""green.""
- The position of ""dax"" in the input does not seem to affect its output; it is consistently ""green"" regardless.
- The presence of other words does not alter the output associated with ""dax""; it remains ""green"" even when combined with other words (lug, zup, walm, bluf) that correspond to their own colors.",1.0,42,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we should compare the inputs and outputs to identify any patterns. From the examples provided:

Input: dax lug                 Output: green blue
Input: dax zup walm wif walm   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
Input: lug bluf dax bluf       Output: blue blue green green
Input: lug walm dax            Output: blue blue blue green
Input: lug dax lug             Output: blue green blue

Observations:
1. The presence of ""dax"" in the input always results in ""green"" appearing in the output.
2. ""Dax"" seems to precede other colors indicated by other words like ""lug,"" which results in ""blue.""
3. ""Dax"" doesn't appear to influence how many times the subsequent color is repeated; the repetition is tied to the words following ""dax.""

Based on these observations, the rule we can induce is:

Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the sequence of the other colors. 

Therefore, dax -> green.",0.9,42,dax
"Analyzing the provided examples:

1. dax lug -> green blue
2. dax zup walm wif walm -> green yellow yellow yellow red red red
3. lug bluf dax bluf -> blue blue green green
4. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
5. lug dax lug -> blue green blue

Looking at the examples, it's clear that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". 

To determine what ""dax"" means, we can examine cases where it appears:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""lug"" (example 1), ""green"" precedes ""blue"".
- In the second example, ""dax"" is followed by three different words: ""zup,"" ""walm,"" and ""wif."" It results in ""green"" followed by three ""yellow"" and three ""red"" (possibly representing each color repeated the number of times the words following ""dax"" are repeated in the sequence).
- In the third example, ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"" (possible typo for ""lug""?). This results in ""green"" followed by ""green"" (perhaps due to the ""bluf"" following ""dax"").
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" follows two occurrences of ""lug walm"" and results in a single ""green"" after three ""blue"" colors.
- The fifth example mirrors the first one; ""dax"" follows ""lug"" and results in ""green"" between the two ""blue"" instances.

Based on the repetition pattern, it seems that ""dax"" introduces ""green"" and it doesn't necessarily have a one-to-one correspondence with the number of times it is mentioned in the input, unlike ""lug"" for ""blue"".

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" could be: it signals the introduction of ""green"" in the sequence, and its presence causes a color change in the pattern.

Rule: dax -> introduces green.",0.8,42,dax
"Rule: wif -> ""red"" after a word translates that word's associated color

Analyzing the given examples, it seems that each occurrence of the nonce word ""wif"" is directly followed by the color ""red"". In each case, one might assume that ""wif"" acts as a function that translates a word into its associated color, and then appends ""red"" to the sequence. Each non-""wif"" word seems to be associated with a specific color: ""dax"" with ""green,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" etc. The presence of ""wif"" does not change the color associated with the preceding word but adds a ""red"" after it.

Here is the breakdown:

- ""dax wif"" becomes ""green red"" (thus ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""wif"" adds ""red"")
- ""lug wif"" becomes ""blue red"" (so by the same logic, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""wif"" adds ""red"")
- ""lug dax walm wif"" adds a ""red"" after the sequence of colors associated with ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""walm"" respectively. This suggests that ""walm"" translates to ""green"" as it is repeated three times, like the ""green"" color in the output.
- ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" gives a sequence where ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" based on their positions. ""wif"" adds ""red"" following both ""bluf"" and ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" appends ""red"" to the color sequence after translating the preceding non-""wif"" word to its associated color.",1.0,42,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to indicate the addition of the color red to the output sequence. Each occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" appearing in the output, regardless of the other colors present or their order. Taking this into account, we can formulate the following interpretation:

wif -> meaning: The word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red'.

Rule: Whenever 'wif' is present in the input, 'red' should be included in the output at the corresponding position of 'wif' in the input sequence.",1.0,42,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following patterns:

1. Every time the word ""dax"" appears before ""wif,"" the output contains ""green"" before ""red.""
2. Every time the word ""lug"" appears before ""wif,"" the output contains ""blue"" followed by ""red,"" unless ""dax"" is also before ""wif,"" which leads to ""green"" preceding ""blue"" and then ""red.""
3. The word ""walm"" does not appear to affect ""wif"" directly, but ""walm"" maps to ""green"" individually.
4. The word ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" and its presence does not seem to affect the meaning of ""wif,"" which remains consistent with ""red"" following colors mapped from words preceding ""wif.""

From these observations, we can induce the rule:

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the word ""red,"" and it also seems to trigger the translation of the word immediately preceding it into its corresponding color.

Thus,

wif -> red",0.9,42,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" functions as a separator or a signal for a reversal in the sequence of corresponding color names. In each case, the colors before ""wif"" are reversed in order after ""wif"" is mentioned. 

Let's verify the rule with each example:

Input: dax wif lug
Output: green red blue 
Rule Verification: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and after ""wif"", ""lug"" (which is ""blue"") comes before ""green"".

Input: lug wif
Output: blue red
Rule Verification: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and after ""wif"", it is followed by ""red"" with no explicit word before ""wif"" to pair with ""red"". This shows that ""wif"" might also signal the addition of ""red"".

Input: lug dax walm wif
Output: blue green green green red
Rule Verification: Before ""wif"", we have ""lug"" as ""blue"", ""dax"" as ""green"", and ""walm"" as ""green"" (repeated for emphasis). After ""wif"", the sequence ""green green blue"" is reversed, followed by ""red"".

Input: dax wif
Output: green red
Rule Verification: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and after ""wif"", it is followed by ""red"", which is consistent with the second example suggesting the appearance of ""red"" when no preceding word can be reversed.

Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
Rule Verification: Before the first ""wif"", ""zup"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""yellow"" (twice), then ""wif"" signals the reversal, so we see ""red yellow yellow"" which includes the ""red"" after ""wif"". Then, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and after the second ""wif"", we see ""red"" and then ""yellow"", which is reverted order for ""zup"" (""yellow"").

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be:

Rule: When encountering ""wif"" in a sequence, reverse the order of the color names that appear before it, and after ""wif"", always include ""red"". If there's a word after ""wif"", continue with corresponding colors normally, if not, ""wif"" itself prompts ""red"" to be added.

wif -> triggers a reversal of the previous color names and appends ""red"".",0.8,42,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we should look at each instance where it occurs and see how the output is affected:

Input: dax wif lug -> Output: green red blue
Input: lug wif -> Output: blue red
Input: lug dax walm wif -> Output: blue green green green red
Input: dax wif -> Output: green red
Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow

Looking at the examples, ""wif"" appears before a color is repeated in the output. Here's a breakdown of what's happening in each example:

1. ""dax wif lug"" translates to ""green red blue"". ""Wif"" precedes ""red"" which is a new color added after ""green"".
2. ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red"". ""Wif"" precedes ""red"" here as well.
3. ""lug dax walm wif"" translates to ""blue green green green red"". ""Wif"" precedes ""red"" which follows three ""green"" in a row.
4. ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red"". Again, ""wif"" comes before ""red"".
5. ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow red green red yellow"". ""Wif"" appears twice here, each time before the color ""red"".

Based on these observations, it seems that ""wif"" serves as an indicator that the color ""red"" will come next in the sequence, after any given pattern of other colors. 

Rule: wif -> Signals the upcoming appearance of the color ""red"" in the sequence.",0.8,42,wif
"Based on the examples given, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs. It does not appear to depend on context or position within the input string. Thus, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,42,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the other words (such as ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""bluf"") that correlate with different colors.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow",1.0,42,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"", regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,42,zup
"zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position or the context in which it appears.",1.0,42,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,42,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be that it takes on the color of the preceding word. Let's analyze the examples to reach this conclusion:

1. ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" translates to ""red green red red yellow red"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is red, so ""bluf"" also becomes red.

2. ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which is green, so ""bluf"" also becomes green.

3. ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which is blue, so ""bluf"" also becomes blue.

4. ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" translates to ""yellow red red yellow blue"". Here ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is red, so ""bluf"" becomes red in this context.

5. ""zup dax bluf"" translates to ""yellow green green"". Here ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which is green, so ""bluf"" becomes green.

Every time the word ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,42,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates directly to the color that is associated with the word immediately preceding it. This pattern holds true in all given examples. 

Here's how the rule applies in each case:

- In the first example, ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"" and translates to ""red"", so ""bluf"" also translates to ""red"".
- In the second example, ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"" and translates to ""green"", so ""bluf"" also translates to ""green"".
- In the third example, ""lug"" comes before ""bluf"" and translates to ""blue"", so ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue"".
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" precedes the first instance of ""bluf"" and translates to ""red"". In the sequence ""zup wif bluf"", ""wif"" before ""bluf"" corresponds once more to the color ""red"". The subsequent ""lug"" in ""zup lug"" translates to ""blue"", although there's no ""bluf"" following it.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"" and translates to ""green"", so ""bluf"" also translates to ""green"".

Rule:
bluf -> the word ""bluf"" translates to the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,42,bluf
Rule: bluf means the same color as the word that precedes it.,1.0,42,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we look at the relationship between the inputs and the outputs, looking for consistency in the translated colors.

Here are the established associations from the examples between single words and colors:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Now, let's analyze the use of ""bluf"":

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is surrounded by the word ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" However, ""bluf"" results in the output ""red."" This suggests that ""bluf"" may be a ""replicator"" that copies the color of the word immediately before it.

2. In the second example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" which supports the hypothesis that ""bluf"" is taking the color of the word before it.

3. The third example, ""lug bluf,"" outputs ""blue blue,"" further supporting that ""bluf"" matches the previous word's color.

4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and once again, the output is ""red red,"" following the previous set pattern.

5. In the last example, ""zup dax bluf,"" we observe that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" As ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green,"" consistent with the ""replicator"" hypothesis.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes on the color associated with the immediately preceding word in the input.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the immediately preceding word.",1.0,42,bluf
"Based on the provided input-output pairs, it is possible to deduce that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that comes before it in the sequence. Here's the breakdown:

In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and since ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" the output for ""bluf"" is also ""red.""

In the second example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output for both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" is ""green.""

In the third example, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the outputs for both are ""blue.""

The fourth example is consistent with this pattern, where ""zup"" precedes two instances of ""bluf,"" and the output for ""zup"" and the following ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""

The fifth example follows the same pattern with ""dax"" before ""bluf"" and both outputting ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> outputs the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,42,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a few things. 

Firstly, in each example, the term ""walm"" is associated with a sequence of a color being repeated. 

Here is the breakdown:

1. wif walm -> red red red
2. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
3. zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green
4. wif walm -> red red red
5. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red

We can see that in examples 1 and 4 where ""wif walm"" is given, the output is ""red red red"" indicating that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" results in the color being repeated three times.

In example 2, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green"", showing that ""walm"" makes the color before it repeat three extra times, totaling four times for ""lug"" and hence ""blue blue blue blue"".

Similarly, in example 3, ""lug"" which is before ""walm"" is repeated four times as ""blue"" showing consistency, and ""wif"" and ""dax"" maintain their color associations, ""red"" and ""green"" respectively.

Finally, in example 5, ""lug walm"" repeats ""blue"" three extra times besides its initial appearance, making it ""blue blue blue blue"", and ""wif"" retains its association with ""red"".

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word three additional times.",1.0,42,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

- Each instance of ""walm"" is followed by a color repeated three times: ""red red red"", ""blue blue blue"", etc.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". These words are followed by their corresponding colors a number of times equal to their position in the input. For example, ""wif"" is first, followed by ""red"" once; ""lug"" is second, followed by ""blue"" twice; ""dax"" third, followed by ""green"" three times.
- When ""walm"" follows any of these words, it takes the associated color and repeats it three times, possibly indicating that ""walm"" is an intensifier or duplicator for the most recent color mentioned before it.

Therefore, taking these observations into account:

Rule: walm -> intensifies the most recent color mentioned before it by repeating that color three times.",1.0,42,walm
"walm -> repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is used, the color associated with the directly preceding word is repeated three times. If ""walm"" follows after ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red,"" and if it follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""",1.0,42,walm
"Based on the context provided by the examples, we can try to deduce a pattern for what the term ""walm"" might mean. Let's analyze the given sequences and their corresponding outputs to identify any consistent correlations.

1. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

3. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

4. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

5. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red

Examining these inputs and outputs, it seems that whenever the word ""walm"" appears, the output is a repetition of the color associated with the the previous word, with the number of repetitions being three times. Let's check this with each instance:

1. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the output after ""walm"" is ""red red red.""
2. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and the output after ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue.""
3. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm"" appears in this example, the output is ""blue blue blue"" once again.
4. The fourth example is a repeat of the first and yields the same output for ""wif walm.""
5. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and once again ""walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue.""

From the examples provided, we can conclude that ""walm"" indicates repetition of the color corresponding to the previous word, three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,42,walm
"From the examples given, it looks like the word ""walm"" contributes to the number of color repetitions in the output. However, it does not seem to directly correspond to a specific color itself.

Considering the given examples:

1. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"".
2. ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue"".
3. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue red green"".
4. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"".
5. ""lug walm wif bluf"" results in ""blue blue blue red red"".

Now, analyzing the examples:

- When it is ""wif walm"", ""wif"" is associated with ""red"" and ""walm"" seems to triple the output for ""wif"", resulting in ""red red red"".
- When it's ""dax lug walm"", ""dax"" leads to ""green"" and ""lug"" leads to ""blue"". With the inclusion of ""walm"", ""lug"" is repeated three more times (totalling four ""blue""), but ""dax"" (green) isn't repeated. This suggests ""walm"" affects the word right before it, tripling its output.
- When ""walm"" follows both ""lug"" and ""wif"" in the input, it only amplifies the output of ""lug"" but does not affect ""wif"".
- When ""lug walm"" is followed by ""wif bluf"", ""lug"" is tripled (like before), but ""wif"" and ""bluf"" are unaffected.

Given these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" triples the output of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it while not impacting the representation of any other colors following it.

Rule: walm -> triples the output of the color associated with the word directly before it.",0.8,42,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,43,lug
"
Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,43,lug
"Based on the inputs and outputs provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" could mean ""repeat the following color"". Whenever the word ""lug"" is used, the color that appears immediately after it is repeated in the output.

Here are the observations supporting this deduction:

1. ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue,"" which indicates that ""blue"" is repeated.
2. ""lug bluf zup"" leads to ""blue blue yellow,"" where ""blue"" is repeated before yielding ""yellow.""
3. ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green,"" showing that ""blue"" is repeated twice before presenting ""green.""
4. In ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax,"" the output ""red blue blue yellow yellow green"" has ""blue"" repeated after ""lug"" and before other colors follow.
5. Finally, ""dax bluf lug wif"" becomes ""green green blue red,"" where ""green"" is not repeated likely because ""dax"" precedes ""lug.""

However, interpreting the rule is complicated by the last example, where ""green"" was not repeated even though ""lug"" was present in the sequence. Since we encounter a potentially conflicting example, it could be that the rule applies only when ""lug"" is directly followed by a color term. It's also possible that there is an overriding rule not yet discernible due to limited context. With these examples, the most consistent pattern suggests:

Rule: lug -> repeat the following color term.",0.8,43,lug

From these examples, we can see that the color outputted immediately after the word ""bluf"" seems to be a repetition of the color corresponding to the word before ""bluf"". Wherever ""bluf"" appears, it takes the color of the word immediately preceding it:

1. After ""zup"" (yellow), ""bluf"" results in ""yellow.""
2. After ""lug"" (blue), ""bluf"" results in ""blue.""
3. After ""wif"" (red), ""bluf"" results in ""red.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it takes on the color of the preceding word.

From these examples, it is clear that ""bluf"" adopts the color of the word that precedes it. In each case where ""bluf"" is used, it takes on the color value of the word in front of it:

- In Input 1, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" also outputs ""yellow.""
- In Input 2, there are two instances of ""bluf,"" each following ""lug"" and ""zup,"" respectively. ""Bluf"" takes the color of ""lug"" (blue) and then the color of ""zup"" (yellow).
- In Input 3, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and outputs ""red,"" just like ""wif.""

"Rule: dax -> green

Based on the inputs and outputs, it appears that every time the word 'dax' is used, it is translated to the color 'green'. This holds true regardless of the position of 'dax' in the input sequence or the other words present. As such, 'dax' consistently corresponds to 'green'.",1.0,44,dax
"Based on the input and output examples provided, it seems that 'dax' corresponds to the output 'green.' The color that follows 'green' in the sequences appears to be determined by the word that comes after 'dax'. For words that precede 'dax', they are translated to a color without being affected by the presence of 'dax'. 

Let's break it down:

- 'wif dax' translates to 'red green'; 'wif' corresponds to 'red,' while 'dax' corresponds to 'green.'
- In 'lug dax walm', 'lug' gives 'blue,' 'dax' again corresponds to 'green,' and 'walm' seems to repeat the color following 'dax' so it gives 'green green green'.
- For 'zup dax walm', 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow,' 'dax' corresponds to 'green,' and again 'walm' repeats the color 'green' three times.
- 'dax lug zup' provides us with 'green blue yellow', aligning with the previous interpretations where 'dax' is 'green,' 'lug' is 'blue,' and 'zup' is 'yellow.'
- Lastly, 'wif bluf dax' yields 'red red green', where 'wif' is 'red,' 'bluf' seems to repeat the previous color which is also 'red', and 'dax' remains consistent with 'green.'

- Other words in the input correspond to different colors in the output: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
- The word preceding or following ""dax"" does not impact its translation which stays consistent as ""green.""

Here's what we can observe:

1. Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.
2. No other input word consistently translates to ""red.""
3. ""wif"" does not seem to change meaning based on position in the sequence.

Based on this, we can conclude that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" regardless of its position or the context within the sequence.

Examples:

1. zup dax walm lug wif → yellow green green green blue red
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which outputs green, thus ""walm"" also outputs green.

2. dax zup walm wif → green yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which outputs yellow, thus ""walm"" also outputs yellow.

3. lug walm zup walm → blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word.,1.0,44,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can observe that the output color sequence extends with repetition whenever ""walm"" is mentioned in the input. The color that is repeated is the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

We can break down each example to understand the pattern associated with ""walm"":

1. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   (The word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which outputs ""green,"" and after ""walm"" we see ""green"" repeated.)

2. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   (The word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" which outputs ""yellow,"" and after ""walm"" we see ""yellow"" repeated.)

3. Input: lug walm zup walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
   (The first ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which outputs ""blue,"" so we see ""blue"" repeated. The second ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which outputs ""yellow,"" so we see ""yellow"" repeated.)

4. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   (The first ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which outputs ""blue,"" so we see ""blue"" repeated. The second ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which outputs ""red,"" so we see ""red"" repeated.)

5. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   (The first ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which outputs ""green,"" so we see ""green"" repeated. The second ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which outputs ""red,"" so we see ""red"" repeated.)

Using these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in the input, it causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated in the output sequence. The number of repetitions can be inferred from the examples and appears to be based on the instance count of the ""walm"" within that input sequence.

Therefore:

walm -> Causes the color corresponding to the word before it to repeat. The repetition count is based on the instance count of ""walm"" in the input (e.g., the first occurrence of ""walm"" results in two additional repetitions, the second occurrence in three, and so on).",1.0,44,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine its usage and the corresponding output in the given examples. 

- Whenever ""walm"" appears, the subsequent color repeats until a new word is introduced or the sequence ends.
  
Now, let's apply this observation to the examples:

1. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   - After ""walm,"" the color ""green"" repeats until ""lug.""

2. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   - Following ""walm,"" the color ""yellow"" repeats until ""wif.""

3. Input: lug walm zup walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" and ""blue"" repeats. Another ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and ""yellow"" repeats.

4. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   - ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" and ""blue"" repeats until ""wif."" Another ""walm"" leads to a repeat of ""red.""

5. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   - ""Walm"" after ""dax"" results in repeated ""green"" until ""wif."" Another ""walm"" results in repeated ""red"" until ""zup.""

Using these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: The presence of the word ""walm"" causes the previous color to repeat until a different color-inducing word appears or the sequence concludes. 

So, walm -> causes the previous color to be repeated.",1.0,44,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the color sequences in the outputs for each instance of ""walm.""

1. In the first example, ""walm"" is between ""lug"" and ""wif,"" and the output is a sequence of green colors followed by blue and then red. Since ""lug"" is associated with blue in the third example, it seems that ""walm"" could be contributing to the green colors in the sequence.

2. In the second example, ""walm"" is between ""zup"" and ""wif,"" and the output is yellow followed by repeated colors of yellow red. Again, ""walm"" may be contributing to the repeated colors, which are yellow this time.

3. In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" twice, and the output is blue followed by repeated colors of blue yellow. Similar to the first example, ""walm"" is associated with repeated colors following the color that corresponds to the word before it, which is blue.

4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and then later is followed by ""wif,"" resulting in repeated blues and then repeated reds in the output.

5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and then later precedes ""zup,"" resulting in repeated greens followed by a sequence of reds and then yellow.

Considering these observations, ""walm"" seems to indicate the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. Hence, if ""lug"" is blue, then ""lug walm"" leads to two blues in the output. The repetition continues until another color word appears. If ""wif"" is red, it ends the repetition sequence. The length of the repetition might be indicated by the number of times ""walm"" is said or it might always be three, as seen in every example.

Rule: Walm creates a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, typically repeating the color three times before a different color word appears.

walm -> causes the color of the previous word to be repeated three times.",0.9,44,walm

"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in each example, regardless of its position or the other words around it.",1.0,45,lug
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look for patterns associated with its presence in the input and the corresponding segment in the output.

- In the first input, ""dax walm wif,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" to another ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" given that there is one ""red"" in the output. However, the addition of the word ""wif"" also changes the expected output color from green to red.
  
- In the second input, ""dax bluf,"" we see ""dax"" followed by ""green"" and ""bluf"" followed by ""green"" again.

- In the third input, ""dax wif,"" ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""

- In the fourth input, ""lug walm dax,"" we see all three other words besides ""dax"" yield ""blue,"" but ""dax"" yields ""green.""

- In the fifth input, ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup,"" we notice that ""dax"" corresponds with ""green"" just like the previous examples, and ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" with ""red,"" and ""wif"" with ""red.""

From these observations, we can establish a rule for ""dax"": it consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of the position in the input sequence or the other words present. Furthermore, the presence of ""dax"" does not seem to modify the output colors of the words around it, indicating that the meaning of ""dax"" is independent from its context within these given examples.

Taking all these observations into account, we can propose the following rules for ""dax"":

- When ""dax"" appears, it is associated with the output ""green.""

From the first and fourth examples, we can see the pattern:

Input: zup wif

In the second example:

Input: lug zup lug
Output: blue yellow blue

Here ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""zup"" is sandwiched between, producing ""yellow"".

- In the first and fourth examples, ""zup wif"" outputs ""yellow red"". Since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the third example (""wif zup bluf wif dax"" to ""red yellow yellow red green""), ""zup"" is therefore ""yellow"".
  
- In the second example, ""lug zup lug"" translates to ""blue yellow blue."" Since ""lug"" is consistent with ""blue"", ""zup"" must be ""yellow"" to fit in the sequence.

- In the third example, there's a sequence that includes ""wif zup bluf wif dax."" Since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green"" (by the output of the third input), and ""bluf"" clearly translates to ""yellow"" given its double occurrence in the sequence with the same output, it follows that ""zup"" must mean ""yellow"" as ""red yellow yellow red green"" is the output.

- Here, ""zup"" is between two occurrences of ""lug,"" which seems to correspond to ""blue"" as ""lug zup lug"" results in ""blue yellow blue."" Again, ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow.""

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green
- In this case, ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" and then by ""wif."" Comparing this to the initial outputs, ""bluf"" corresponds to the first ""yellow"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" It still seems like ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" regardless of what comes before or after.

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
- This is the same as the first example with the same output, which further supports the idea that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- In this example, ""zup"" appears twice with ""bluf"" and ""lug"" in between and ""walm"" at the end. ""Bluf"" has previously corresponded to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" We can see that ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the occurrence of ""zup"" at the end also produces ""yellow."" 

Based on these observations, it appears that:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position or surrounding words.

zup -> yellow",0.8,45,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color. Across all inputs, whenever the nonce word ""bluf"" is presented, the output is consistently ""yellow."" Therefore, we can determine the rule for the word ""bluf"" as follows:

bluf -> yellow",1.0,45,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of bluf, let's look at the position where ""bluf"" appears and what color it corresponds to in the output:

1. zup (yellow), dax (green), bluf (green), wif (red), zup (yellow), bluf (yellow), lug (blue)
2. lug (blue), dax (green), bluf (green), zup (yellow), lug (blue), wif (red)
3. zup (yellow), bluf (yellow), dax (green), lug (blue), bluf (blue), dax (green), zup (yellow)
4. wif (red), zup (yellow), bluf (yellow)
5. wif (red), bluf (red), lug (blue), dax (green), wif (red)

From the examples, we can see that the word ""bluf"" is assigned the same color as the word that immediately follows it in the input. Here are the instances:

- In the first input, the first ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" and the second ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug."" The outputs correspond to ""red"" and ""blue,"" respectfully.
- In the second input, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow.""
- In the third input, the first ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" and the second ""bluf"" by ""dax"" yet again. Both times, the output is ""green.""
- In the fourth input, ""bluf"" is followed immediately by the end of the input. In this case, ""bluf"" takes the color from the word preceding it, ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" and the output is ""blue.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the word that follows it, except in cases where it is the last word, where it duplicates the color of the word before it.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the following word, or if it's the last word, the preceding word.",1.0,45,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to compare each input line with its corresponding output line and look for patterns associated with the use of ""bluf.""

From the examples given:

1. ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue"" 
2. ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" -> ""blue green green yellow blue red""
3. ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"" -> ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow""
4. ""wif zup bluf"" -> ""red yellow yellow""
5. ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" -> ""red red blue green red""

We can establish the following mappings from the other words with consistency through all examples:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red

When analyzing the position of ""bluf"" in respect to the colors outputted:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" appears twice, yielding ""green red"" and then ""yellow blue"" in the following positions.  
- In example 2, ""bluf"" yields ""green yellow"".
- In example 3, the occurrences of ""bluf"" lead to ""yellow green"" and then ""green yellow"".
- In example 4, ""bluf"" yields ""yellow"".
- In example 5, ""bluf"" yields ""red blue"".

The consistent rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the next word in the sequence.

Let's verify with the examples:

1. ""bluf"" before ""wif"" (red) -> next color is red.
2. ""bluf"" before ""zup"" (yellow) -> next color is yellow.
3. ""bluf"" before ""dax"" (green) and then before ""lug"" (blue) -> next colors are green and blue.
4. ""bluf"" before no word (because it is at the end) -> default to yellow (from the adjacent ""zup"").
5. ""bluf"" before ""lug"" (blue) -> next color is blue.

Hence, the rule seems to be:

**Rule:** bluf -> assumes the color value of the immediately following word in the sequence. If bluf is followed by no word, it assumes the color value of yellow.

This analysis leads to the rule:

**bluf -> meaning:** The color value of the following word. If no word follows, the default is yellow.",1.0,45,bluf
"Given the examples provided, we can analyze the pairs of inputs and outputs to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" Let's take it step by step:

Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug  
Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue  

Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif  
Output: blue green green yellow blue red  

Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup  
Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow  

Input: wif zup bluf  
Output: red yellow yellow  

Input: wif bluf lug dax wif  
Output: red red blue green red  

In the first line of examples, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" when preceded by ""dax,"" ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup,"" and ""blue"" when it is followed by ""lug.""

In the second line, ""bluf"" is ""green"" after ""dax"" and ""blue"" when followed by ""zup.""

In the third example, ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" when followed by ""dax"" and ""blue"" when it is preceded by ""lug.""

In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup.""

In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is ""red"" when following ""wif,"" ""blue"" when it is followed by ""lug,"" and ""green"" when it is followed by ""dax.""

Using these inputs and outputs to deduce the fundamental rule that defines ""bluf,"" it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of whatever word immediately precedes or follows it, but some rules override others. 

The rules appear to be:
- If ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" it is red.
- If ""bluf"" comes before or after ""lug,"" it is blue.
- If ""bluf"" comes before or after ""dax,"" it is green.
- If ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" it is yellow.

It's important to note that ""bluf"" takes on the overriding color in the case of conflicting rules, as seen with the position of ""lug"" and ""dax.""

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color of the preceding or following word, with a hierarchy that certain words override others (wif -> red, lug -> blue, dax -> green, zup -> yellow).",0.9,45,bluf
"To figure out the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we'll analyze the examples given where ""bluf"" corresponds to a specific color in the output. Across all the examples, ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Here are the consistent pairings of each input word with the output color:

- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""bluf"" -> yellow

Based on the examples, it seems that ""bluf"" directly translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> yellow",0.0,45,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns surrounding the word in each example.

- In the second example ('zup walm'), the output is 'yellow yellow yellow.' Since 'zup' appears once and correlates with one 'yellow,' we can deduce that 'walm' likely means 'repeating the previous color.'
- In the third example ('dax wif walm lug zup'), we see 'green red red red blue yellow.' After 'dax' we have 'green,' and after 'wif' we have 'red,' followed by 'walm' and then a sequence of 'red.' Here 'walm' repeats the color 'red,' which was just mentioned.
- In the fourth example ('dax lug walm'), 'green blue blue blue' shows that 'dax' corresponds to 'green' and 'lug' to 'blue.' Following 'walm,' the color 'blue' is repeated.
- In the fifth example ('dax walm zup lug walm'), 'green' corresponding to 'dax' is repeated after 'walm,' and then 'lug' corresponds to 'blue,' which is also repeated after 'walm.'

From these patterns, we can deduce that:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning: Repeat the color mentioned just before 'walm' for the number of times 'walm' appears.",1.0,45,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that precedes it multiple times. Here are the observations:

- When walm follows ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue""), the output is multiple ""blue"".
- When walm follows ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red""), the output is multiple ""red"".
- When walm follows ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow""), the output is multiple ""yellow"".
- When walm follows ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green""), the output is multiple ""green"".

In all instances, the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" is repeated three times. This suggests the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,45,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" represents repetition of the color that came before it. For each instance of ""walm,"" the output is a sequence of the same color that directly precedes it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color that immediately precedes it.",1.0,45,walm
Rule: walm -> the color of the word that immediately precedes it.,1.0,45,walm
"To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" we must look for patterns in the examples provided.

In the first example, we see that ""walm"" follows ""lug wif"" and results in a change from the expected ""blue red"" sequence to ""red red red blue."" This suggests that ""walm"" could be affecting the sequence of output colors in some way.

In the second example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" Without additional context for ""zup,"" it's challenging to infer the exact rule but we can guess that ""walm"" might repeat the color before it.

In the third example, ""wif walm lug zup"" results in ""red red red blue yellow."" Here, ""walm"" seems to have caused ""red"" to repeat three times before switching to ""blue.""

In the fourth example, ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue,"" where ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in the color ""blue"" being repeated three times.

In the fifth example, ""dax walm zup lug walm"" results in ""green green green yellow blue blue blue."" The colors repeat three times after ""walm"" is mentioned initially after ""dax"" and finally after ""lug.""

From these examples, we can induce that ""walm"" repeats the color sequence of the previous word three times.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,46,zup
"To figure out the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the given input-output pairs. We need to establish what each word corresponds to in terms of the color output.

We can start by identifying patterns for the known words. For instance, we know that:

- ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"".
- ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green"".

Now, let's look at the instances of ""bluf"":

1. In the first input ""wif zup bluf"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and then ""bluf"" results in another ""yellow"". 

2. In the second input ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"", we observe that ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and results in a second ""yellow"" before the sequence continues with ""red"" corresponding to ""wif"".

3. In the third input ""zup bluf"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow"".

4. In the fourth input ""dax bluf wif zup wif"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""bluf"" that follows results in another green, before the sequence continues with ""wif"" resulting ""red"".

5. Finally, in the fifth input ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"", it ends with ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"" followed by ""bluf"" which results in ""green"" again.

From these examples, it's noticeable that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. Thus, ""bluf"" seems to be a placeholder for ""repeat the color of the previous word"".

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word.",1.0,46,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the relationship between the input and the output in each example:

1. Input: wif zup bluf -> Output: red yellow yellow
2. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
3. Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
4. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif -> Output: green green red yellow red
5. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> Output: red green yellow red green green

Looking at the examples above, we can see that:

- Every time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" immediately follows in the output.
- ""Bluf"" does not seem to be affected by its position in the input sentence since ""yellow"" always follows regardless of the surrounding words.
- No matter what other words are present (""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""dax""), ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> yellow.",1.0,46,bluf
"Rule: 

Based on the provided examples, ""bluf"" is being translated to ""green."" In every instance where ""bluf"" appears, the corresponding output color is ""green."" Therefore:

"Based on the input-output pairs, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color ""green"" when looking at its direct translation in the output.

Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the previous color.,1.0,46,walm
Rule: walm -> three consecutive instances of the previous color.,1.0,46,walm
"Based on the provided inputs and outputs, we can deduce a pattern for what ""walm"" means in this context. Here's the analysis:

- In every instance where ""walm"" is included in the input, the output contains a sequence of three green colors.
- There is no variance in color before or after the sequence of greens that could be attributed to the word ""walm.""
- The number of repeated greens is always three, which shows a consistent pattern whenever ""walm"" is present.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: walm -> three consecutive green colors.",1.0,46,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to correspond to a repeated output of the color immediately preceding it in the sequence. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

When ""walm"" follows another word, the output color for ""walm"" is the same as the output color for the word immediately before it, and this color is repeated three times.

Here are the rules extracted in the context of the given examples:

- ""zup wif dax walm lug"" gives ""yellow red green green green blue"". Here ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which outputs the color green, so ""walm"" results in ""green green green"".
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" gives ""red red green green green"". Here ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" giving us ""green green green"" again.
- ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" provides ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow"". Both instances of ""walm"" follow ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red, hence ""red red red"" after each ""wif walm"".
- ""zup wif walm"" gives ""yellow red red red"". Here ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" so it gives ""red red red"".
- ""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue"". In this case, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" so ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is:

**Rule: walm -> The output for 'walm' is the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it, repeated three times.**",1.0,46,walm
"By examining the given examples and their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Let's look at each input and output pair:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" corresponds to three green outputs in a sequence.
2. In the second input, again, ""walm"" corresponds to three green outputs.
3. The third example shows that ""wif"" maps to red, and following ""wif walm"" twice, results in red red red. ""Walm"" seems to be applying the ""wif"" color thrice.
4. In the fourth example, ""wif"" is red, followed by ""walm"" producing two more red outputs.
5. Finally, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" indicating ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" (i.e., blue) three times.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times. Therefore, based on the available data, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" is as follows:

2. In ""lug walm dax"", ""lug"" is the first word and maps to the first color in the output, ""blue"".
3. In ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"", ""lug"" appears after ""zup"" and still corresponds to ""blue"".

"Considering the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""dax"" by looking at where it appears and what output is given in each case. Here are the examples again, with attention specifically on ""dax"":

3. Input: zup wif dax walm lug => Output: yellow red green green green blue

5. Input: wif bluf dax lug => Output: red red green blue

Looking at these examples:

- In the first and fourth examples, ""dax"" appears to directly translate into ""green.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" is followed by ""wif walm,"" and the output is ""green"" followed by ""red red red,"" which leads to the rule that ""dax"" itself translates to ""green"" and does not affect the subsequent words.
- The third example has ""dax"" followed by ""walm lug,"" producing ""green green green blue,"" again showing that ""dax"" by itself is ""green"" and ""lug"" does not seem to be influenced by ""dax"" (assuming ""lug"" is ""blue"").
- In the fifth example, like in the others, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

Based on these observations, the rule is:

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green,"" irrespective of the context in which it occurs.",1.0,47,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Every time the word ""dax"" is used in the input, the output always includes the color green. Therefore, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.",1.0,47,dax
"By analyzing the given examples, I have observed the following correlations:

- Whenever 'wif' appears, it is followed by the word 'red' in the output.
- The word 'dax' correlates with 'green' when it follows 'wif', but also when it precedes it.
- The word 'bluf' only appears once, and it is followed by 'red red'. Since 'wif' always produces one instance of 'red', the 'bluf' may be responsible for the second 'red'.
- The word 'walm' seems to be linked with 'red' when it follows 'wif', but 'green' when it precedes 'dax' and is not directly associated with 'wif'.
- The position of 'zup' is correlated with 'yellow', but its relationship with 'wif' is not directly shown, as 'wif' precedes its resulting 'red'.

Based on the patterns observed, the rule can be deduced as follows:

wif -> 'red'

Rule: Whenever 'wif' is present, the immediate output is 'red'. Other words such as 'dax', 'walm', 'bluf', and 'zup' contribute additional colors based on their positioning and combination, but the presence of 'wif' consistently results in the word 'red' in the output sequence.",1.0,47,wif
"Based on the given examples:

- wif dax -> red green
- wif bluf -> red red
- dax zup wif -> green yellow red
- wif walm dax -> red red red green
- dax walm wif dax -> green green green red green

It would appear that the nonce word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red' because in each output sequence where 'wif' is present, the color red also appears at the same position.

But looking more closely, every instance of 'dax' corresponds with 'green'. So when 'wif' is followed by 'dax', the output is 'red green'. When 'dax' precedes 'wif', like in the third input, 'green' precedes 'red' in the output. In cases where 'dax' is both before and after 'wif', 'green' is before and after 'red' in the output. This indicates that 'wif' likely corresponds to 'red', regardless of the position and that it does not necessarily depend on what precedes or follows it.

'Bluf' does not appear to have a corresponding output color, except in the presence of 'wif', where it produces 'red'. Therefore, it is possible that 'bluf' does not change the output color on its own, but 'wif' will still produce 'red'.

'Walm' appears to not impact the translation of 'wif'. However, when 'walm' follows 'dax', they both translate into 'green', suggesting 'walm' might correspond to 'green' given the context of following 'dax'.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

wif -> red

Meaning is that 'wif' always corresponds to the color 'red' in the output.",1.0,47,wif

- When ""wif"" is immediately followed by ""dax,"" the output is ""red green.""
- When ""wif"" is immediately followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
- When ""wif"" is at the end of a sequence without an immediate follower, the output ends with ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm dax,"" the output is ""red red red green,"" which is the concatenation of ""wif walm"" -> ""red red"" and ""wif dax"" -> ""red green.""
- When ""wif"" is immediately followed by ""dax"" in a longer sequence, ""wif dax"" is still ""red green.""

It appears that ""wif,"" regardless of its position or the words around it, seems to produce ""red"" as the first output color. The color(s) that follows depends on the next word. If the next word is ""dax,"" then ""green"" follows. If the next word is ""bluf,"" then another ""red"" follows. The presence of ""walm"" produces an additional ""red."" When there is no word following ""wif,"" as in example 3, there is still a ""red"" in the output.

With the information above, we can deduce a potential rule for ""wif"":

Rule: ""wif"" indicates that the output should start with ""red,"" with the following color(s) dependent on the subsequent word(s).

Therefore:

wif -> 'red' as the initial color in the sequence, followed by a pattern that may vary depending on the words that come after ""wif.""",1.0,47,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following rules associated with the occurrence of the nonce word 'wif':

1. Every time 'wif' appears in an input, 'red' is included once in the corresponding output.
2. The additional words that follow 'wif' or precede 'wif', such as 'dax', 'bluf', 'walm', each seem to have their own associated color.
3. 'dax' correlates with 'green', as seen when it is either before or after 'wif'.
4. 'bluf' correlates with 'red', as it appears alongside 'wif' and results in ""red red"".
5. The placement of 'wif' in the sequence does not alter its representation as 'red'.
6. 'walm' correlates with 'red' too, since it follows 'wif' and looks to add another 'red' to the sequence.
7. 'zup' correlates with 'yellow', but it is not directly related to 'wif', as it appears in a sequence without changing the 'wif' representation.

Therefore, the rule for 'wif' can be stated as:

Rule: Whenever 'wif' is present in a sequence, it translates to the color 'red' in the output sequence. The word 'wif' is not context-dependent and always corresponds to 'red', regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it.",0.9,47,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Here are the correlations according to the examples:

- ""dax zup"" leads to ""green yellow"" (where ""dax"" likely corresponds to ""green"")
- ""zup lug dax"" results in ""yellow blue green"" (where ""lug"" likely corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green"")
- ""zup"" on its own translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug walm zup lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"" (where ""lug"" probably means ""blue"" and ""walm"" directly follows ""lug,"" thus might be of no change; ""zup"" means ""yellow"")
- ""lug dax zup lug wif"" results in ""blue green yellow blue red"" (where ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is likely ""red"")

Rule:
zup -> yellow",1.0,47,zup
"Based on the examples provided, ""zup"" consistently results in the word ""yellow"" in the output. It does not appear that ""zup"" changes meaning based on its position in the input sequence. Here is how the rule appears to operate based on each example:

1. ""dax zup"" -> ""green yellow"" 
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

2. ""zup lug dax"" -> ""yellow blue green"" 
   - Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""dax"" to ""green"".

3. ""zup"" -> ""yellow"" 
   - Alone, ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow"".

4. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"" 
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" must correspond to ""blue"" as well since the sequence ""lug walm"" repeats the output ""blue blue"". ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the middle of the sequence.

5. ""lug dax zup lug wif"" -> ""blue green yellow blue red"" 
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow. ""Zup"" means yellow regardless of where it appears in the sequence.",1.0,47,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,47,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each unique word corresponds to a color. We can assign the colors to the known words as follows from the examples:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- walm -> implicitly could be deduced as blue because it is inserted in between repetitions of ""lug"" which is known as blue, so to keep consistency in ""lug walm zup lug walm"" outputting ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"", ""walm"" would also need to represent blue.

Every example that includes ""zup"" has the color yellow in its output. It appears consistently as a corresponding color, regardless of whether ""zup"" is at the beginning, middle, or end of the input.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,47,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sentence.",1.0,47,zup

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" acts as a command to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it in the output sequence. Here is the rule derived from the examples:

- When ""bluf"" follows a word, the color associated with that preceding word is repeated.

Therefore:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""zup lug bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue,"" where ""bluf"" causes ""lug""'s corresponding color to be repeated.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green,"" with ""bluf"" causing the repetition of ""green.""

"bluf -> meaning. Rule: bluf causes the following word to be repeated in the output with its corresponding color. If ""lug"" is ""blue,"" then ""lug bluf lug"" results in ""blue blue blue.""

"Based on the given examples, we can infer that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. 

Here's how we can deduce this:

1. lug dax walm -> blue green green green
   ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""dax"" to green. ""walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times.

2. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
   ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

3. zup lug walm wif walm -> yellow blue blue blue red red red
   ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""wif"" corresponds to red. ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three times, and ""walm"" after ""wif"" results in ""red"" being repeated three times.

4. dax walm wif -> green green green red
   ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""wif"" corresponds to red. ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times.

5. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
   ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""wif"" corresponds to red. ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

From these observations, it appears that the general rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word exactly three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,47,walm
"walm -> repeats the color corresponding to the previous word the number of times equal to the number of letters in that word.

Rule: 
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" and has three letters, so when followed by ""walm,"" it outputs ""blue"" repeated three times.
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" and has three letters, so when followed by ""walm,"" it outputs ""green"" repeated three times.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" and has three letters, so when followed by ""walm,"" it outputs ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" and has three letters, so when followed by ""walm,"" it outputs ""red"" repeated three times.

Note: The rule seems to depend on the word that comes immediately before ""walm"" and does not take into account any words that may come between ""walm"" and the word that determines its color repetition, as seen in the example ""zup lug walm wif walm"" where ""wif"" does not influence the first ""walm"" but influences the second ""walm"" following it.",1.0,47,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word multiple times. The number of repetitions seems to correspond exactly to the number of letters in the preceding word. To clarify with examples:

- ""lug dax walm"" results in ""blue green green green."" Here, ""dax"" has three letters, so ""green"" is repeated three times after ""walm.""
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" has three letters, so ""yellow"" is repeated three times after ""walm.""
- ""zup lug walm wif walm"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue red red red."" Here, ""lug"" has three letters, so ""blue"" is repeated three times after the first ""walm."" Then, ""wif"" has three letters, so ""red"" is repeated three times after the second ""walm.""
- ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red."" Here, ""dax"" has three letters, so ""green"" is repeated three times after ""walm."" ""wif"" doesn't follow a ""walm,"" so it does not repeat.
- ""zup walm wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow red."" Here, ""zup"" has three letters, so ""yellow"" is repeated three times after ""walm."" Same as above, ""wif"" doesn't follow a ""walm,"" so it does not repeat.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word as many times as there are letters in the preceding word.",1.0,47,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to represent a repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. Here's the pattern observed:

1. lug dax walm: The word ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""dax"" corresponds to green. The word ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" hence we see green repeated three times.
2. zup walm: The word ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. Since ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" yellow is repeated three times.
3. zup lug walm wif walm: We have ""zup"" for yellow, ""lug"" for blue, and ""wif"" for red. ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" so blue is repeated three times, and ""walm"" following ""wif"" means red is repeated two more times (making it red repeated thrice).
4. dax walm wif: ""Dax"" for green is followed by ""walm"" so green is repeated three times, and then ""wif"" signifies red.
5. zup walm wif: ""Zup"" for yellow is followed by ""walm"" so yellow is repeated three times, and then ""wif"" signifies red.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" repeats the color of the previous word thrice.",1.0,47,walm
"Analyzing the given examples, let's first look for patterns associated with the output colors for each input that does not contain the nonce word ""walm"".

- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" (seen in the first and third inputs).
- ""dax"" translates to ""green"" (seen in the first and fourth inputs).
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" (seen in the second and third inputs).
- ""wif"" translates to ""red"" (seen in the third, fourth, and fifth inputs).

Now, let's examine the patterns when ""walm"" is introduced:

1. ""lug dax walm"" outputs ""blue green green green,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to the first ""blue,"" ""dax"" to the first ""green,"" and ""walm"" results in the repetition of ""green"" twice.
2. ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to the first ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" seems to repeat the color twice.
3. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" gives ""yellow blue blue blue red red red,"" where it seems that ""walm"" repeats the last color mentioned thrice.
4. ""dax walm wif"" gives ""green green green red,"" again showing ""walm"" repeating the last color before it, which is ""green.""
5. ""zup walm wif"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" again, ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" thrice before ""wif"" changes it to the last color ""red.""

From these observations, we can deduce that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the last color mentioned three times. So, we can define ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: walm -> repeat the last color mentioned three times.",1.0,47,walm
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,48,lug
"lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue

Rule: ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in each example provided.",1.0,48,lug
"lug -> meaning. 

Rule: ""lug"" means ""blue"".",1.0,48,lug

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in each of the examples provided.",1.0,48,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each given example.",1.0,48,lug

dax -> green.",1.0,48,dax
"Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Each non-""dax"" nonce word seems to correspond to a unique color as well. ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" (like ""dax""), ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" (like ""lug"").

Thus, the rule is:
dax -> green",1.0,48,dax
"From the examples given, it seems that there is a pattern that correlates certain words with colors:

- In the first input, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In the second input, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" with ""dax"" still being ""green.""
- In the third input, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" with ""wif"" still being ""red"" and ""dax"" again being ""green.""
- In the fourth input, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" (and is repeated) and ""walm"" does not seem to have a color associated, with ""dax"" being ""green.""
- In the fifth input, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" seems to be ""red"" as well, with ""dax"" as ""green.""

Consistently across all examples, ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green."" The meaning of the word ""dax"" seems to be independent of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,48,dax
"Rule:
- dax -> green

From the given examples, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"". The other words seem to correspond to different colors, with their position not affecting the color they represent:

- lug -> blue

- zup -> yellow
- walm -> blue

Therefore, the rule is that ""dax"" means green, irrespective of its position or the words around it.",1.0,48,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"", regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words around it. Each instance where ""dax"" appears, the output consistently includes ""green"" at the corresponding position. Other words such as ""lug"", ""wif"", ""bluf"", ""zup"", and ""walm"" appear to correlate with their own color translations (""blue"", ""red"", ""blue"", ""yellow"", and ""red"", respectively). However, ""dax"" solely corresponds to ""green"".",1.0,48,dax
"Based on the examples given, each nonce word seems to correlate with a specific color:

- ""wif"" corresponds with ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds with ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds with ""yellow"" (deduced from example 3, where ""bluf"" is repeated as additional 'yellow')
- ""walm"" corresponds with ""red"" (deduced from examples 3 and 4, where ""walm"" appears more than once and always correlates with 'red')

From these examples, the word ""wif"" always results in the output ""red"", regardless of its position in the sequence. Hence, we can deduct the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,48,wif
"From the given examples, each word seems to have a corresponding color as follows:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> yellow
- walm -> red (In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by multiple reds, matching the number of letters in ""walm"", so ""walm"" could mean red repeated for each letter in ""walm"".)

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: Each nonce word is associated with a specific color. ""Wif"" consistently translates to the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,48,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look at the consistencies in the outputs relative to its position and usage in the inputs:

1. Every instance of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red.""
2. The word ""wif"" is not modified by its position in the sequence nor by adjacent words.
3. No other inputs besides ""wif"" produce the output ""red.""

Given these observations, we can determine that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding context.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,48,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we'll examine the examples' inputs and outputs, focusing on where the nonce word ""wif"" appears and what color it corresponds to in the output.

Input: wif
Output: red

- When ""wif"" is the only word, the output is ""red.""

Input: zup lug wif dax lug
Output: yellow blue red green blue

- ""wif"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""dax,"" resulting in the output ""red.""

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

- ""wif"" follows ""dax,"" leading to ""red.""
- ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and follows ""bluf,"" leading to ""red red red.""

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

- ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" and the output is again ""red.""

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

- ""wif"" is the first word, leading to ""red.""

From these examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,48,wif
"Based on the statement provided and the examples, it appears that each nonce word has a color associated with it. Here's how the association looks based on the examples:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> red
- bluf -> yellow

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,48,wif
"To discern the rule for the word ""zup,"" let's look at the output it produces in various contexts:

1. When ""zup"" follows ""wif walm"" or ""wif,"" it outputs yellow (the sequence ""wif zup"" appears multiple times).
2. When ""zup"" precedes ""wif,"" it again outputs yellow, maintaining a consistent output regardless of whether it comes before or after ""wif.""
3. The term ""zup"" does not seem to always produce the same color (yellow) when it follows other words, like ""bluf"" or ""dax."" 

Given these examples, it appears that ""zup"" may represent ""yellow"" consistently.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,48,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""zup"" acts as a modifier to the immediately following word, resulting in the output being the color associated with the modified word repeated twice, except when the following word is ""wif,"" which results in ""yellow red."" Also, the word ""zup"" on its own translates to ""yellow.""

To break it down:

1. When ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
2. When ""zup"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""yellow blue.""
3. When ""zup"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output is ""yellow red.""
   
The repetition of the color seems to be caused by the presence of ""zup."" For example, ""walm"" on its own would translate to ""yellow,"" but when it is preceded by ""zup,"" we have ""yellow yellow yellow.""

From all other examples, we can infer these translations:
- ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" translates to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

So, our deduction is that ""zup"" generally means that the color of the next word will be repeated once or, in the case of ""wif,"" affect the output by changing it to ""yellow red.""

Rule: zup -> Repeat the color of the next word once if the next word is ""walm,"" ""lug,"" or ""bluf,"" and output ""yellow red"" if the next word is ""wif."" If ""zup"" stands alone, it translates to ""yellow.""",0.9,48,zup
"To deduce the meaning of zup, we need to identify patterns and correlate them with changes in the output. Let’s examine each input-output pair individually.

First pair:
- Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
- Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Second pair:
- Input: zup wif
- Output: yellow red

Third pair:
- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
- Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Fourth pair:
- Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
- Output: red yellow yellow red green

Fifth pair:
- Input: zup walm wif
- Output: yellow yellow yellow red

Let's analyze:

1. ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red,"" as seen in each pair.
2. ""walm"" also consistently corresponds to ""yellow,"" except on one occasion it turns to blue after zup. However, it seems to reset to ""yellow"" after a ""lug"".
3. ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue,"" as seen in the third pair.
4. ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green,"" as seen in the third and fourth pairs.
5. ""zup"" appears to change its output each time it's used.

Let's look more closely at zup:
- In the first pair, the first ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and the second ""zup"" right after it corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the second pair, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and it is the first occurrence.
- In the third pair, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and it's the first ""zup”.
- In the fourth pair, the ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and it indicates the first occurrence as well.

Based on the patterns, we can induce that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when it is the first occurrence or when it follows ""wif"" or ""bluf"". But when ""zup"" follows another ""zup"", the color changes to ""blue"".

Hence, the rule we can form is:
- zup -> means ""yellow"" except when it follows another ""zup,"" in which case it means ""blue"".

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"" on first occurrence or following ""wif""/""bluf""; ""blue"" when following another ""zup"".",0.8,48,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let’s examine the examples and their corresponding outputs systematically.

1. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   
In the first input, we see that ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" The word ""zup"" appears before the last instance of ""lug"" and before another ""walm."" This results in one ""yellow"" being inserted before ""lug"" and one before ""walm."" 

2. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   
Here, ""zup"" comes before ""wif"" and translates into a single ""yellow"" before ""red.""

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   
Again, ""zup"" appears before ""bluf"" and ""lug,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow"" before their corresponding colors ""blue"" and ""blue.""

4. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
   Output: red yellow yellow red green
   
""Zup"" is again before ""bluf"" resulting in two ""yellow"" preceding ""blue"" and ""red.""

5. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   
Here ""zup"" is before ""walm,"" which yields a double ""yellow"" before the ""yellow"" that corresponds to ""walm.""

From these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""zup"" in the input indicates the presence of an extra ""yellow"" in the output, followed by the color which corresponds to the word immediately after ""zup.""

Therefore: zup -> an additional ""yellow"" before the color corresponding to the next word.",0.8,48,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to look for patterns in the color outputs related to its presence. Let's match up each usage of ""zup"" with the respective sequence of colors:

1. wif walm zup lug zup walm -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - Here, ""zup"" precedes ""lug,"" which results in ""yellow blue."" In the next occurrence, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" which results in ""yellow yellow.""

2. zup wif -> yellow red
   - Here, ""zup"" precedes ""wif,"" which results in ""yellow red.""

3. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   - Here, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" which results in ""yellow yellow.""

4. wif zup bluf wif dax -> red yellow yellow red green
   - Here again, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" which results in ""yellow yellow.""

5. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
   - Here, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" which results in ""yellow yellow.""

So far, we can observe that after every ""zup"" the color pattern starts with ""yellow."" Thus, we can deduce one part of the meaning of ""zup"" is to produce the color ""yellow.""

Now let's figure out the second color after ""yellow."" After ""zup,"" we see different second colors:
- ""zup lug"" -> ""yellow blue""
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow""
- ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red""
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""

The results are not entirely consistent. However, we see that when ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" or ""bluf,"" it produces two yellow colors. When ""zup"" precedes ""wif"" or ""lug,"" it does not result in two yellows; it produces ""yellow"" followed by the color that the following word represents.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""zup"" acts as a color modifier that results in the color ""yellow,"" and it seems to repeat the color of the following word unless that word denotes red or blue (since ""wif"" outputs red and ""lug"" outputs blue without a preceding ""zup""). 

Rule: ""zup"" produces ""yellow"" and causes the repetition of the color generated by the next word unless that word represents ""red"" or ""blue,"" in which case, ""zup"" only produces ""yellow,"" and the subsequent color is what would naturally follow from the word (red for ""wif"" and blue for ""lug"").",0.7,48,zup
"Rule: bluf means ""green"", but when it comes before or after the word ""dax"", which means ""green"", it means ""blue"".",0.8,48,bluf
"bluf -> blue. 

Rule: Each occurrence of the word ""bluf"" in the input is translated to ""blue"" in the output.",0.0,48,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,0.0,48,bluf
"Reviewing the given examples and their corresponding outputs, I can infer a rule based on the word ""bluf"" and its resultant color.

In each instance, the presence of ""bluf"" results in the word ""red"" in the output. However, unlike other words like ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" that consistently translate to a single color every time, ""bluf"" seems to cause the word ""red"" to repeat once for itself and once for the preceding word in the sequence.

For example:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and the output for these is ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" generates an additional ""blue"" in the sequence.
- In the second example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for these two is ""red red,"" with ""bluf"" again causing a repetition of the preceding color.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is both preceded and followed by different words, but each time it repeats the color previous to it - again ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and ""green"" for ""dax.""

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it causes a repetition of the color assigned to the preceding word in the sequence. If we represent the preceding word's color with 'X', then the rule for ""bluf"" could be described as follows:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color (X) of the preceding word, such that the output for ""bluf"" is ""X X.""",0.0,48,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,0.0,48,bluf
"walm -> meaning. 

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color word before it to be repeated three times. If ""walm"" follows a color-coded word (zup, lug, wif, dax), then the corresponding color for that word is repeated. For example, if ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow), then ""yellow"" is repeated three times in the output. If ""walm"" is not preceded by a recognized color-coded word, it does not have an effect on the output. Here is the breakdown of the color-coded words based on the examples:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green

So the word ""walm"" would translate to ""repeat the previous color three times.""",1.0,48,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- The words ""zup"", ""lug"", ""wif"", ""dax"" correlate with the colors ""yellow"", ""blue"", ""red"", ""green"" respectively.
- The word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that precedes it.

Here are the observed rules applied to each input:

For the input: ""zup lug walm wif walm""
- ""zup"" correlates with yellow
- ""lug"" correlates with blue 
- ""walm"" after ""lug"" repeats the color blue
- ""wif"" correlates with red
- ""walm"" after ""wif"" repeats the color red

Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

And similar logic applies to the other examples given.

So the rule for ""walm"" can be deduced as: When used after a color word, ""walm"" repeats the color of that word for as many times as ""walm"" appears consecutively.

walm -> rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated.",1.0,48,walm
"walm -> meaning. Rule: The word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color of the immediately preceding word. For instance, if ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which translates to the color blue, ""walm"" means that blue will be repeated. If ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which is red, then ""walm"" means red will be repeated, and so on. ""Walm"" causes the previously mentioned color to be outputted multiple times, typically two additional times but varying depending on context. If ""walm"" is repeated itself, as in ""walm wif walm,"" it indicates a continuation of the repeating color sequence.",1.0,48,walm
"walm -> three repetitions of the previous color. 

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is used, it signifies that the color mentioned just before it should be repeated three times. 

Examples:
- In ""wif walm,"" since ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, ""walm"" means that red should be repeated three times.
- In ""lug walm,"" since ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""walm"" means blue should be repeated three times.
- In ""dax walm,"" since ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""walm"" means green should be repeated three times.",1.0,48,walm
"From the given examples, it is clear that the word ""walm"" has a transformative effect on the colors mentioned before it. To understand what ""walm"" means, let's analyze each case:

Input: zup lug walm wif walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
- Here, ""lug"" turns to ""blue"" twice after ""walm,"" and ""wif"" turns to ""red"" thrice after ""walm.""

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
- In this input, ""wif"" turns to ""red"" thrice after ""walm,"" and ""lug"" turns to ""blue"" thrice at the end, following after a ""dax"" changes to ""green.""

Input: zup dax lug walm zup
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
- Here, ""lug"" turns to ""blue"" thrice after ""walm.""

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
- In this case, ""dax"" turns to ""green"" thrice after ""walm.""

Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green
- In this example, ""dax"" turns to ""green"" thrice after ""walm.""

Based on these observations, it seems that the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the color word immediately preceding it to be outputted three times. Hence:

walm -> meaning: The color word before ""walm"" is repeated three times. 

Rule: If a color word is followed by ""walm,"" output that color word three times.",0.9,48,walm
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,49,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each output.",1.0,49,lug
"Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" by looking at the patterns between the input and the output.

1. In every output sequence, the word ""blue"" always appears at least once.
2. When ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" is included in the output at the position correlating with where ""lug"" was in the input.

Looking at the specific examples:

- ""wif lug"" outputs ""red blue"", and ""lug wif"" outputs ""blue red"". In both cases, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red"".
- ""dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue blue blue"", here ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""walm"", by process of elimination, seems to correspond to multiple ""blue""s.
- ""lug bluf dax lug"" outputs ""blue blue green blue"", where both occurrences of ""lug"" correspond to a single ""blue"", ""bluf"" to ""blue"", and ""dax"" to ""green"".
- ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue"", with ""lug"" and ""bluf"" each corresponding to ""blue"".

From the above observations, we can deduce that:

Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the word ""blue"".",1.0,49,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the rule for what ""lug"" means in this context:

Example analysis:
- In all instances where ""lug"" is present, the output contains the word ""blue"".
- ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"", as shown in the first and fourth inputs.
- ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"", as observed in the second and third inputs.
- ""Walm"" produces four ""blue""s in output, indicating a repetition, but since we are focusing on ""lug,"" we will not conclude further on ""walm"".
- ""Bluf"" seems to correspond to ""blue"", observed in the third and fifth inputs.

Rule:
lug -> blue",1.0,49,lug
"lug -> meaning. Rule: lug translates to ""blue"". 

Supporting Evidence:
1. In every instance where ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears the same number of times in the corresponding output.
2. Regardless of the position of ""lug"" in the input, it consistently corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, suggesting that ""lug"" means ""blue"" and is not context dependent within the given examples.",1.0,49,lug
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color word ""green."" However, in some sequences, the other words (""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""walm"") are associated with other colors (""yellow,"" ""red,"" ""blue""). Additionally, it seems that the presence of ""dax"" in a string does not change the color associated with the surrounding words.

Here is the pattern that we can deduce from the examples:

- dax, when it appears by itself or with other words, corresponds to ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is preceded or followed by other words, those words have their own corresponding colors. For example, ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" also corresponds to ""blue.""

Given this information, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green. Each unique word corresponds to a color, and the output lists the colors for each word in the order they appear. The word ""dax"" specifically corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,49,dax
"Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" seems to be correlated with a specific color output, specifically the color green. Each instance of the word ""dax"" in the input correlates with the color green in the output, irrespective of its position in the sequence or the words that surround it.

Therefore, the rule can be indicated as follows: dax -> green.

Rule: Whenever the input contains the word ""dax,"" the output will include the color green corresponding to each occurrence of ""dax.""",1.0,49,dax
"Analyzing the given examples:

1. Input: dax
   Output: green
   Rule: dax -> green

2. Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
   Output: yellow green green yellow green
   Rule: zup -> yellow, dax -> green, bluf -> green

3. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   Rule: wif -> red, dax -> green, lug -> blue, walm -> blue

4. Input: dax lug wif
   Output: green blue red
   Rule: dax -> green, lug -> blue, wif -> red

5. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   Rule: lug -> blue, walm -> blue, dax -> green

Combining all rules deduced from the examples, and given that there are no contradictions, the word ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green"", regardless of where it appears in the sequence. Other words in the examples correspond to different colors but also follow a consistent pattern without being influenced by the presence of ""dax"".

Therefore, the rule I can deduce is:

dax -> green",1.0,49,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". The meaning seems to be independent of context since ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position within the input sequence.

Thus, the rule can be stated as: dax -> green. 

Rule: Whenever dax is present, the output is ""green"".",1.0,49,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" always translates to the color ""green,"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,49,dax
"Examining the provided examples, it appears that each instance of a nonce word is associated with a specific color. The word ""wif"" consistently results in the color ""red."" Even when ""wif"" is presented alone, the output is ""red,"" indicating that its meaning is not dependent on context within this set of data. Based on these examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,49,wif
"Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".",1.0,49,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" let's examine its usage across various examples and their corresponding outputs:

Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
Output: yellow red red yellow blue

Input: dax wif
Output: green red

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Input: wif zup lug
Output: red yellow blue

Input: wif
Output: red

Looking closely at the output sequences, it's noticeable that the color ""red"" appears exactly once in every output sequence where ""wif"" is present in the input. Even in the last example, where the input is only ""wif,"" the output is ""red."" This suggests that ""wif"" invariably corresponds to the color red, independent of its position in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:
wif -> red.",1.0,49,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

Each time the word 'wif' appears in the examples, it corresponds to the color 'red'. Therefore, 'wif' means 'red'.",1.0,49,wif
"Based on the examples provided, ""wif"" appears to consistently translate to ""red"". Each time ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output. Regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it, the translation remains the same.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,49,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position or surrounding words in the sentence. Therefore, the meaning of ""zup"" is clear.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,49,zup
"Based on the provided examples, zup consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Each occurrence of the word ""zup"" in the input corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that surround it.

"Rule: zup -> yellow

The examples consistently show that every time the word ""zup"" appears, it is translated as ""yellow.""",1.0,49,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the given context.",1.0,49,zup
"Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of the position within the sequence or the words that come before or after it. It does not seem to have any dependency on context, as it is always replaced with ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,49,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at each instance of its use and identify a pattern in the outputs. Here are the patterns we see:

- ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue."" 
- ""wif dax bluf"" outputs ""red green green."" 
- ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" outputs ""green yellow red red blue."" 
- ""wif bluf lug zup"" outputs ""red red blue yellow.""
- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue blue red blue blue.""

From the examples, it seems that ""bluf"" is related to the duplication of the color code that comes just before it. 

In the first example, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" follows, resulting in ""blue blue."" 
In the second example, ""dax"" stands for ""green,"" and followed by ""bluf,"" it results in ""green green."" 
In the third example, ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" follows right after, resulting in ""red red.""
In the fourth example, again ""wif"" is ""red,"" and followed by ""bluf,"" leading to ""red red.""
In the fifth example, there are two ""lug"" before ""bluf,"" and after ""bluf,"" there are two ""blue,"" corresponding to those two instances of ""lug.""

Based on this, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" duplicates the color code that appears directly before it in the sequence. The number of duplications equals the number of times the color word preceding ""bluf"" occurs in the sequence.

bluf -> meaning: duplicate the preceding color code in the output, with the duplication count being equal to the count of the preceding color word in the input sequence.",1.0,49,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" repeats the color word immediately preceding it.",1.0,49,bluf
"Analyzing the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" represents the color of the word that precedes it. For instance:

- In the first example, ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""wif dax bluf"" corresponds to ""red green green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" mirrors the color of ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
- The pattern continues similarly in the other examples.

Given this observation, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,49,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" replicates the color word that precedes it. In each example, the output color for ""bluf"" is the same color word that appears immediately before it in the input. Here are the rules:

2. wif dax bluf -> red green green (Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to green, hence ""bluf"" also translates to green.)
3. dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue (Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which translates to red, hence ""bluf"" also translates to red.)
4. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow (Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which translates to red, hence ""bluf"" also translates to red.)
5. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue (Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to blue, and since ""lug"" appears two times in a row before ""bluf,"" ""bluf"" is repeated as well, resulting in blue blue.)

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the duplication of the color word that immediately precedes ""bluf.""",1.0,49,bluf
"Analyzing the given examples, I will attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by assessing its correlation to the input-output sequence.

1. lug bluf -> blue blue
2. wif dax bluf -> red green green
3. dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue
4. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
5. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue

Let's analyze the word ""bluf"" in each context:
- In the first line, ""bluf"" appears with ""lug"" and produces ""blue blue"". This could imply that ""bluf"" represents the color ""blue"".
- In the second line, however, ""bluf"" follows ""wif dax"" and results in two greens instead of a blue, which challenges the first hypothesis.
- The third line has ""bluf"" yield ""red"" when ""wif"" is present and ""blue"" when ""lug"" follows. This inconsistency makes assigning a single color to ""bluf"" problematic.
- The fourth line has ""bluf"" in the middle of ""wif"" and ""lug"", and it outputs ""red blue"".
- In the fifth, ""bluf"" outputs ""blue blue"" when ""lug"" is on both sides.

Looking for another pattern, we can consider the possibility that ""bluf"" replicates the color of the word preceding or following it (except in cases where ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"").

1. lug bluf -> blue replicated because ""lug"" is adjacent.
2. wif dax bluf -> ""bluf"" output is green, but the pattern isn't consistent because ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", and its output should be yellow following this rule. However, in this case, ""wif"" seems to affect the output, making colors green.
3. dax zup wif bluf lug -> ""bluf"" outputs red; the rule appears inconsistent unless ""wif"" overrides it, demanding an output of red.
4. wif bluf lug zup -> ""bluf"" outputs red, which follows the idea that ""wif"" being present before ""bluf"" demands a red output.
5. lug walm wif lug bluf -> ""bluf"" outputs blue twice, following the adjacent ""lug"".

Based on this pattern, I hypothesize that ""bluf"" represents a rule where it takes on the color of the adjacent word unless ""wif"" precedes it, in which case the output color is consistently red.

Rule: bluf -> ""bluf"" replicates the color of the word adjacent to it unless ""wif"" is immediately before it, in which case the output is red.",0.8,49,bluf
"Observing the patterns in the examples provided, it becomes apparent that the appearance of the nonce word ""walm"" dictates the output of the following colors which appear in triplicate, independent of the colors indicated by other words in the inputs.

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

- ""wif walm lug bluf"" leads to ""red red red red blue blue"" – ""wif"" is ""red"" and is repeated four times due to ""walm,"" then ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" but without a ""walm"" following it, so it's not repeated.
- ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow yellow blue red red"" – ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and is repeated four times because of ""walm,"" then ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" but since neither is followed by ""walm,"" they are not repeated.
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue blue"" – ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated four times.
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow yellow"" – ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" results in it being repeated four times.

- The examples show that ""wif"" is not affected by its position in the input.
- No other words in the inputs correlate consistently with ""red"" in the output.

Considering these correlations, it seems that after every occurrence of the word ""wif,"" the color ""red"" is output. Viewing this pattern across all examples supports the hypothesis:

1. ""wif zup bluf"" -> ""red yellow yellow"" 
   Here, ""wif"" leads and is followed by ""zup,"" which gives ""yellow"" for the output of ""zup.""

2. ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red green red red""
   In this sequence, ""wif"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""dax,"" which results in the second ""wif"" producing ""green"" after ""dax.""

3. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" -> ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue""
   ""wif"" leads and is followed by ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue."" We also see ""wif"" followed by ""lug"" twice here, both times resulting in ""red.""

4. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue red yellow red""
   Here, ""lug"" leads and is followed by ""wif,"" which in turn precedes ""zup,"" resulting in ""red.""

5. ""dax wif lug dax"" -> ""green red blue green""
   ""Wif"" follows ""dax"" and is followed by ""lug"" which translates to ""blue.""

So, we observe that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" when it precedes any other word except for ""dax,"" which seems to transform the following ""red"" into ""green"" when it directly follows ""wif.""

Based on this observation, here is the inferred rule:

Rule: ""wif"" generally translates to ""red,"" except when it is immediately followed by ""dax,"" in which case it changes the subsequent color to ""green.""

Therefore:

wif -> red (general rule)
(wif immediately followed by dax) -> changes the subsequent color to green",0.8,50,wif
"Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,50,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Regardless of its position in the sequence, whenever ""zup"" is present, the output always includes ""yellow."" It follows the same pattern in each example, showing that ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow"" regardless of other words or context.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,50,zup

"Based on the patterns provided in the examples, it appears that ""bluf"" refers to the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Each time ""bluf"" is used, the output is a color word that matches the color assigned to the word that comes right before ""bluf"" in the input. Here is the observed pattern:

- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" meaning ""bluf"" takes the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.
- ""wif zup dax bluf"" translates to ""red yellow green green,"" meaning ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax,"" which is green.
- ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" translates to ""blue green green yellow blue red,"" meaning ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax,"" which is green.
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green,"" meaning ""bluf"" takes the color of ""wif,"" which is red.
- ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" meaning ""bluf"" takes the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.

Rule: bluf -> The same color as the word that comes immediately before it.",1.0,50,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to have the following rule:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning.

Meaning: Repeat the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,50,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color that immediately precedes it in the sequence:

- In ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow.""

- In ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green.""
- In ""wif bluf dax walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red.""
- In ""lug bluf,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

"Based on the examples given, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" always produces a repetition of the previous color mentioned. Given that, here's the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the previous word.",1.0,50,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> the color word that corresponds to the color of the word immediately preceding it. If ""bluf"" is the first word, there is no preceding color, so the meaning cannot be determined from these examples.",1.0,50,bluf
"The input examples seem to follow a pattern that associates specific nonce words with the colors mentioned in the output. Here's the breakdown:

1. wif -> red
2. lug -> blue
3. dax -> green
4. bluf -> blue

Now let's focus on the appearances of ""walm"" across different examples:

- Every time ""walm"" appears, a sequence of ""blue blue"" follows it in the output.
- ""walm"" does not appear to have a one-to-one correspondence with a single ""blue"" (since ""lug"" already corresponds to a single ""blue"").
- The number of ""blue"" colors following ""walm"" is always two, regardless of the position or other words surrounding ""walm"".

Considering this pattern across all provided examples, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, it translates to two ""blue"" colors in the output.

Thus, we can infer:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: walm corresponds to ""blue blue"" in the output.",1.0,50,walm
"Based on the provided examples, walm seems to correlate with additional repetitions of the color prior to walm in the output. Let's examine the inputs and outputs:

1. ""wif walm lug bluf"" becomes ""red red red blue blue"". Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and after ""walm,"" the word ""lug"" outputs two ""blue"" instead of one.

2. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" turns into ""green blue green blue blue blue"". In this sequence, the color before ""walm"" is ""blue,"" and two more ""blue"" are added in the output.

3. ""dax walm wif dax"" translates to ""green green green red green"". For ""dax walm,"" ""green"" is tripled, similar to the first case.

4. ""dax lug walm"" becomes ""green blue blue blue"". Here, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and two more ""blue"" appear in the output.

5. ""lug walm wif bluf"" turns into ""blue blue blue red red"". Similar to previous examples, the output triples the ""blue"" from ""lug"" and then follows the sequence.

Given this pattern, we can deduce that:

Rule: walm causes the color word before it to be repeated two additional times in the output sequence.

Therefore:

walm -> causes the preceding color to repeat twice more in the output.",1.0,50,walm
"walm -> meaning. Meaning is ""blue blue"".

Rule: The word ""walm"" in the inputs is always translated to the output as ""blue blue"". Each instance of ""walm"" correlates to two instances of the word ""blue"" in the outputs.",1.0,50,walm
"walm -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""walm"" appears to be ""blue blue."" In every instance of ""walm"" in the input, the corresponding output contains two consecutive ""blue"" words.

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in the input, it should be translated to two occurrences of the word ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,50,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern of 'walm' within the given examples by looking at the output it generates.

- In the first input ""wif walm lug bluf,"" the output associated with ""wif"" is ""red,"" with ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" has two ""blue"" in the output. ""Walm"" corresponds to two ""red.""
- In the second input ""dax lug dax lug walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" gives us two ""blue.""
- In the third input ""dax walm wif dax,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" ""Walm"" here corresponds to two ""green.""
- In the fourth input ""dax lug walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to three ""blue.""
- In the fifth input ""lug walm wif bluf,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" to two ""red."" ""Walm"" corresponds to two ""blue.""

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color that precedes it. However, there's a catch: when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it results in two ""blue."" When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it results in two ""green."" But when ""lug"" directly precedes ""walm,"" it seems to produce an extra blue ('three' instead of 'two'). This can possibly suggest that ""lug"" has a special interaction with ""walm.""

The apparent inconsistency with ""lug"" and ""walm"" in the fourth example (resulting in three ""blue"") might be due to a formatting error, given that the rule derived from other examples indicates ""walm"" should just duplicate the color preceding it, not add another one.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Duplicates the color of the preceding word in the output.

However, there is an inconsistency in the fourth input that cannot be explained without additional information or examples. Assuming it is an error:

- Other words, such as ""wif"", ""bluf"", ""lug"", and ""walm"", produce different colors depending on their position and combination.

Each example suggests that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""green"" when it comes after the word ""dax."" Therefore, ""bluf"" most likely means ""green"" under the condition that it follows the word ""dax.""

- The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the output ""yellow.""

Given the above, we observe that every time the word ""bluf"" is used, the corresponding output color is ""green."" It does not seem to matter what its position is within the input sequence. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates directly to the color ""green"" regardless of its context within the input sequence.

Rule: bluf -> ""green""",1.0,52,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to determine the meaning or rule associated with the word ""bluf"" by looking for patterns in the input and output pairs.

Here's a breakdown of the given examples:

1. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

2. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

3. Input: dax zup bluf (repeated example)
   Output: green yellow yellow

4. Input: dax bluf lug wif
   Output: green green blue red

5. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green

By observing these examples, we can make some deductions:

- ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" and not followed by any other word (Example 2), ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and another word (Examples 1, 3, and 4), ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow."" This is assuming the other word follows its own consistent rule; ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow"" based on these examples.
- Moreover, ""bluf"" does not seem to directly correlate with ""blue"" as it does with either ""green"" or ""yellow"" in these instances.
- ""lug"" and ""wif"" correspond to ""blue"" and ""red,"" respectively, but this does not appear to directly affect the color associated with ""bluf.""

Given that the only colors we have to work with are red, green, blue, and yellow and that ""bluf"" appears to vary between being green and yellow, it seems that ""bluf""'s corresponding output color depends on the position relative to ""dax"" and potentially the presence of other words.

Therefore, we can tentatively establish the following rule:

Rule: When ""bluf"" immediately follows ""dax"", it outputs ""green."" If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by at least one other word, it outputs ""yellow.""

Thus, the rule induction for ""bluf"" would be:
bluf -> when ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", it corresponds to ""green""; when it follows ""dax"" and precedes another word, it corresponds to ""yellow"".",0.9,52,bluf
"From the given examples, we can infer a pattern that correlates the nonce word ""bluf"" with a particular output color. To figure out the meaning or rule behind ""bluf,"" let's examine each example and the output associated with ""bluf"":

1. Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow
2. Input: dax bluf      -> Output: green green
3. Input: dax zup bluf  -> Output: green yellow yellow
4. Input: dax bluf lug wif -> Output: green green blue red
5. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> Output: red green yellow red green green

We can observe that in examples 1, 3, and 5, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow."" However, in examples 2 and 4, where ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" directly (without ""zup"" in between), the output for ""bluf"" is ""green."" This suggests that the color output for ""bluf"" might be dependent on the context, particularly the word that immediately precedes it.

Since ""wif"" does not seem to affect the output color of ""bluf"" in example 5, we can narrow down the rule to the relationship with ""dax"" and ""zup.""

Considering the above observations, the rule appears to be:
- When ""bluf"" is preceded directly by ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by any word other than ""dax"" (e.g., ""zup""), the output is ""yellow.""

However, since the input set is limited, and the rule induction is based on the given examples alone, there might be additional rules governing ""bluf"" that are not evident without further examples. Thus, the rule might be incomplete or subject to change with new data. 

Based on the given data:

- If preceded directly by ""dax,"" output is green.
- If preceded by any other word, output is yellow.",0.8,52,bluf
"Rule: The word ""walm"" results in the immediate repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

walm -> meaning: Repeat the preceding color three times.

- In the first example, ""dax"" is associated with the color green, and when followed by ""walm,"" the output is three additional greens.
- In the second example, ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow, and when followed by ""walm,"" the output is three additional yellows.
- In the third example, ""dax"" once again precedes ""walm,"" resulting in three more greens in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""zup dax walm"" results in yellow, followed by green, then three more greens, and the pattern continues with the subsequent ""zup wif.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is associated with the color red, and following ""walm,"" there are three more reds.

Hence, ""walm"" triggers three iterations of the last mentioned color.",1.0,52,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let us look at the patterns in the given examples.

From the first example:
- Input: dax wif walm
- Output: green red red red

We know that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red."" Since ""walm"" is the only new word added and we see one instance of ""green"" and three instances of ""red,"" it seems that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with ""wif.""

Looking at the second and third examples, we find the consistent behavior.
- Input: zup wif walm
- Output: yellow red red red
- Input: dax walm wif
- Output: green green green red

Here again, ""walm"" causes the color before it to be repeated three times.

In the fourth example:
- Input: zup dax walm zup wif
- Output: yellow green green green yellow red

We see ""zup dax walm"" leading to ""yellow green green green,"" suggesting again that ""walm"" causes the preceding color (""green"" in this case) to be repeated thrice.

The fifth example:
- Input: wif walm
- Output: red red red

With ""walm"" immediately following ""wif"" and yielding a triplet of ""red,"" the pattern holds.

Rule:
walm -> repeat the previous color three more times.",1.0,52,walm
"Observing the patterns in the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" dictates the repetition of the color word that precedes it. In each case, the color word before ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output. Here are the particulars:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output for ""wif"" is ""red"". After ""walm"" we see ""red red red"".
- In the second example, the same pattern follows with ""wif"" resulting in ""red"", and ""walm"" again leading to a sequence of ""red red red"".
- In the third example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output for ""dax"" is ""green"". After ""walm"" we have ""green green green"".
- The fourth example combines previous rules with ""zup"" resulting in ""yellow"", ""dax"" in ""green"", and ""walm"" repeating the color before it, leading to ""green green green"" after ""dax"" and ""yellow"" after the second ""zup"".
- The fifth example again shows that ""wif"" leads to ""red"", and ""walm"" after ""wif"" leads to ""red red red"".

1. ""dax wif walm"" corresponds with ""green red red red.""
2. ""zup wif walm"" corresponds with ""yellow red red red.""
3. ""dax walm wif"" corresponds with ""green green green red.""
4. ""zup dax walm zup wif"" corresponds with ""yellow green green green yellow red.""
5. ""wif walm"" corresponds with ""red red red.""

From these examples, we can extract the following consistent patterns:

- ""walm"" always corresponds with a series of ""red,"" and the number of ""red"" corresponds to the position of ""walm"":
    - In examples 1 and 2, ""walm"" follows one word (either ""dax"" or ""zup""), and there are three ""red.""
    - In example 3, ""walm"" precedes one word (""wif""), and there are three ""green"" before the ""red.""
    - In example 4, ""walm"" is between two words (""dax"" and another ""zup""), and there are three ""green"" before the second ""yellow"" and subsequent ""red.""
    - In example 5, where ""walm"" is at the end after one word (""wif""), there are three ""red.""
  
- Each occurrence of “dax” corresponds to “green” and each occurrence of “zup” corresponds to “yellow”, while “wif” corresponds to the color “red”.

- The number of colors after ""walm"" coincides with the number of words before it, maintaining the color assigned to those words.

- When ""walm"" comes before ""wif,"" it turns previous occurrences of ""yellow"" and ""green"" into ""green"" as seen in input 4.

Based on these patterns, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the previously mentioned colors to repeat except for ""red"". When ""walm"" is after ""dax"" or ""zup"", it will repeat the color that corresponds to the word that precedes it, except when it precedes ""wif"" when it turns all colors to green except for the final ""red"" which is correspondent to ""wif"".

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the previous word for the number of times the word ""walm"" has occurred in sequence, except when preceding ""wif,"" where it causes all preceding occurrences to turn green until the final ""red"".",0.9,52,walm
"Based on the examples provided, walm seems to correlate with a repetition of the color that follows the word ""wif,"" but with an increment of repetition for each occurrence of ""walm.""

In the examples:

- When ""dax"" is present before ""wif walm,"" the output is ""green"" followed by three repetitions of ""red,"" which is the color associated with ""wif.""
- When ""zup"" is present before ""wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow"" followed by three repetitions of ""red.""
- When ""walm"" is before ""wif,"" the color that precedes ""walm"" is repeated three times before the ""red"" associated with ""wif.""
- When ""walm"" appears between two color-related words (""zup"" and ""dax""), it repeats the first color three times before continuing with the next pattern.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" without any other color word in front, it's simply three repetitions of ""red.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" prompts a repetition of the color that comes after ""wif,"" repeated three times.

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds with the repetition of the color associated with the previous word. Here's how we can break down each example:

1. Input: zup bluf

   Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup"", which is yellow.

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

4. Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.,1.0,53,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to correlate with the output by duplicating the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"". This is consistent across all provided examples.

For instance, in the first example, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" which suggests that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats this color. In subsequent examples, we can see the same pattern where ""bluf"" duplicates the color output of the word before it. In the second example, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the output is ""red red"". The third example shows ""lug bluf"" resulting in ""blue blue"". This pattern continues reliably.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

bluf -> Duplicates the color of the preceding word.",1.0,53,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when preceded by ""wif,"" ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup,"" and ""green"" when preceded by ""dax."" If ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it translates to ""blue.""",1.0,53,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to observe its occurrences in various contexts within the provided examples and note the corresponding output colors. Here are the patterns seen:

Example 1:
Input: zup wif dax walm
Output: yellow red green green green

Example 2:
Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

Example 3:
Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Example 4:
Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Example 5:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

The term ""walm"" appears multiple times with different preceding words, but the output is consistently three repetitions of the color that corresponds to the word immediately prior to ""walm."" That means ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" ""Walm"" hasn't appeared without a preceding word, hence we don't have a case for it being the first element in a sequence.

Based on the given information, we could postulate the following:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color that corresponds to the previous word three times in the output sequence.

Hence, walm -> meaning: Repeat the corresponding color of the previous word three times.",1.0,53,walm
"Analyzing the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" acts as a modifier that repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it multiple times in the output. Based on the examples provided:

- In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""green green green"". 
- In the second example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""blue blue blue"".
- In the third example, ""lug"" again precedes ""walm,"" resulting in ""blue blue blue"".
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output shows ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" is before ""walm,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue"".

The consistent pattern is that the color associated with the word before ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output. Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be output three times consecutively.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.",1.0,53,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each example and the words and colors associated with them.

1. zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green
2. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
3. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
4. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
5. lug walm -> blue blue blue

Analyzing the sequences, we can notice a pattern related to the placement of ""walm"" and the colors that follow:

- In the 1st example, ""walm"" is followed by three greens.
- In the 2nd example, ""walm"" appears before the last two colors and is followed by two blues and then different colors.
- In the 3rd example, ""walm"" is followed by three blues.
- In the 4th example, ""walm"" is followed by one green and the rest are different colors.
- In the 5th example, ""walm"" is followed by three blues.

This suggests that ""walm"" may indicate a repetition of the color that immediately precedes it. In examples where ""walm"" is at the end, the last mentioned color is repeated three times. When ""walm"" is followed by other colors, it seems the repetition rule does not strictly apply beyond ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> indicates a repetition of the preceding color three times, unless followed by more colors, in which case the repetition may be interrupted.",0.8,53,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I will look at the pattern of words and their corresponding colors and try to establish a correlation. Each example has a combination of words, followed by a sequence of colors as output.

Here’s what we know:

1. When ""walm"" appears at the end (after ""dax lug"") in the third example, the output is ""green blue blue blue"", suggesting that ""walm"" may correspond to a repetition of the color that directly precedes it (blue in this case).

2. In the second example ""walm"" follows ""dax lug"" as well, and is followed by ""zup wif"", producing ""green blue blue blue yellow red"". This keeps consistent with the idea that ""walm"" could be extending the preceding color (blue), and then the following words influence the sequence from there.

3. In the fourth example, where the sequence has more variations, ""walm"" follows ""zup lug zup"", which outputs as ""yellow blue yellow"". The appearance of ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", suggesting again that ""walm"" repeats the color before it (yellow in this case).

From these observations, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeats the last color that appeared before it in the sequence.",0.8,53,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns present in the examples. Observing the output of each input containing ""walm,"" we can infer the following:

- Every time ""walm"" is present in the input, a repetition of the color ""blue"" appears in the output.
- The number of times ""blue"" appears is one less than the number of words that come before ""walm"" in the input.

Let's test this by checking each example:

1. Input: ""zup wif dax walm"" -> Output: ""yellow red green green green""
   - There are three words before ""walm,"" and we have three greens (we can ignore the colors and just count appearances).

2. Input: ""dax lug walm zup wif"" -> Output: ""green blue blue blue yellow red""
   - There are two words before ""walm,"" resulting in three blues in the output before the pattern is interrupted by ""zup wif.""

3. Input: ""dax lug walm"" -> Output: ""green blue blue blue""
   - There are two words before ""walm,"" which corresponds to three blues.

4. Input: ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> Output: ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""
   - There are three words before ""walm,"" which corresponds to four yellows in this case.

5. Input: ""lug walm"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue""
   - There is one word before ""walm,"" and there are three blues in the output.

Given the discrepancy in the fourth example where we have yellows instead of blues, we may need to consider if we made a correct initial assumption or if “walm” transforms the previous word in a different manner when it is repeated. 

Thus, there seems to be a mistake in our initial rule as it doesn't hold for all given examples. However, based on the information provided, we're unable to conclude a consistent rule for ""walm"" due to the inconsistency in the fourth example. More examples or information may be required to finalize the rule for ""walm."" Currently, we do see a strong connection with the color ""blue,"" but because of the inconsistency, we cannot confirm the rule.

With the examples given, our tentative rule is:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color generated by the word preceding it as many times as there are words before ""walm,"" minus one.

This rule, however, does not account for all examples as shown above. Additional data is needed to refine the rule for ""walm.""",0.8,53,walm

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that each occurrence of a word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. For the nonce word 'dax', it consistently results in the color 'green' in the output. The first example has 'dax' resulting in 'green'. The second example reinforces this mapping. The third example adds 'zup', which corresponds to 'yellow'. The fourth example has multiple repetitions of 'dax' and 'walm', with 'dax' consistently mapping to 'green' and 'walm' mapping to 'blue'; moreover, 'zup' once again maps to 'yellow'. The fifth example repeats 'bluf' twice, introducing a new word that also corresponds to 'green'.

"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" refers to the color green because each occurrence of ""dax"" in the input leads to an instance of ""green"" in the output. The other words in the inputs (zup, walm, lug, bluf) seem to correspond to different colors or possibly a count of colors (e.g., ""walm"" leading to three instances of blue), but since we're focusing specifically on the meaning of ""dax"":

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,54,dax
"Rule:
Based on the provided examples, the following rules can be deduced for the nonce word ""dax"":

- When the input is solely ""dax"", the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by other nonce words, the output for ""dax"" remains ""green,"" but additional colors appear. These colors correspond to the number of letters in the subsequent nonce words. For example, ""zup"" (3 letters) results in ""yellow,"" which typically follows ""green"" in a sequence (green, yellow). Similarly, ""walm"" (4 letters) produces additional ""green"" outputs, and ""lug"" (3 letters) produces ""blue.""

Therefore, ""dax"" seems to indicate the starting point for a color sequence, or simply, it could mean ""start with green,"" and subsequent words may describe how many times to repeat or change color based on the number of letters or their placement in the sequence.

dax -> ""green"" or ""start with green""",0.8,54,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems like ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,54,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to observe the pattern of how it is translated in the different given inputs and outputs. Let's look at each example:

1. Input: dax lug wif
   Output: green blue red
   
In this example, it seems that dax corresponds to green, lug to blue, and wif to red.

2. Input: lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red
   
In this case, lug is still blue, dax is still green, and wif is again red at the end, but we now have a repetition of green which we are told corresponds to ""walm."" This suggests that ""walm"" does not have its own color but instead repeats the color before it, while the presence of wif still results in red at the end.

3. Input: wif dax
   Output: red green
   
Here, wif appears at the beginning and translates to red, with dax following as green we observed in prior examples.

4. Input: zup dax wif
   Output: yellow green red
   
In this case, zup translates to yellow, dax to green, and wif to red, maintaining the pattern of wif corresponding to red, regardless of position.

5. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
   Output: green green red yellow red
   
Given the output, dax is green, bluf seems to be green as well, each occurrence of wif results in red, and zup translates to yellow, with the final wif again being red.

Taking all these examples into account, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds consistently to the color red, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Thus, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,54,wif
"Based on the examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" It is constant in every output sequence following the string of words from the input that correspond to other colors.

Input: dax lug wif -> Output: green blue red
- Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""green,"" ""lug"" is followed by ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is last followed by ""red.""

Input: lug dax walm wif -> Output: blue green green green red
- ""lug"" is followed by ""blue,"" ""dax"" is followed by ""green."" ""walm"" does not have a specific color correspondence in other examples, but it outputs ""green"" here, potentially indicating it does not change the outcome, or its effect is context-dependent. In the absence of further examples, the rule for ""walm"" is unclear. ""wif"" is again followed by ""red.""

Input: wif dax -> Output: red green
- ""wif"" is first and followed by ""red,"" and ""dax"" is followed by ""green.""

Input: zup dax wif -> Output: yellow green red
- ""zup"" appears for the first time and is followed by ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is consistent with ""green,"" and ""wif"" is again followed by ""red.""

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif -> Output: green green red yellow red
- ""dax"" is first and followed by ""green."" ""bluf"" might be corresponding to ""green"" as well, ""wif"" is followed by ""red,"" then ""zup"" by ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" again by ""red.""

Thus, we can deduce a rule for the nonce word ""wif"" and how it maps to a color in the output:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,54,wif
"Based on the presented examples, we can infer the following rules regarding the nonce word ""wif"":

- When ""wif"" is preceded by the word ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" followed by ""red.""

- The word preceding ""wif"" that is not ""dax"" relates to a color representation in the output, where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- The word ""walm"" is not directly represented in the output by a new color but seems to duplicate the color that follows, suggesting a rule where it repeats the subsequent color (""green"" in the provided examples).

Based on these observations, we can postulate the following rule:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to an output of ""red,"" but when ""wif"" directly follows ""dax,"" there must be a ""green"" inserted before the ""red.""

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

In this case, both instances of ""dax"" become ""green,"" and both instances of ""zup"" following ""bluf"" become ""yellow.""

Here, ""wif"" is translated to ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" ""dax"" becomes ""green."" The word ""walm"" also translates to ""green,"" but since it doesn't follow ""bluf,"" it may not be relevant for deciphering the meaning of ""bluf.""

Input: lug bluf zup lug
Output: blue blue yellow blue

""lug"" is translated to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" after ""bluf"" turns into ""yellow.""

Input: zup wif bluf zup

For example, in ""zup bluf wif,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when ""bluf"" follows, it repeats the color of ""zup,"" which is ""yellow."" Then ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""",1.0,54,bluf
"Rule: bluf repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Explanation: 
- In the first example, ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the color yellow is repeated.
- In the second example, each occurrence of ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it - ""dax"" (green) and ""zup"" (yellow).
- In the third example, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the color red is repeated.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the color blue is repeated.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the color red is repeated, and later ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" and yellow is not repeated because the sequence is reversed (it should be “bluf zup” to repeat yellow).

Based on the observed pattern, the rule can be defined as follows:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",0.8,54,bluf
"walm -> meaning. The meaning seems to be to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times in the output.",1.0,54,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. Here is the breakdown of the rule:

- In the first input, ""zup walm dax,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"" before moving on to the representation of ""dax,"" which is ""green."" When ""dax"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output is ""green red"" where ""wif"" presumably corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second input, ""lug walm wif,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue."" Then ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" resulting in ""red red.""
- In the third and fourth inputs, ""lug walm"" and ""dax walm,"" only the initial colors ""blue"" and ""green,"" respectively, are repeated three times with no additional words to influence the color pattern.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the color associated with that word is repeated three times in the output. 

Hence: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,54,walm
"walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:

Considering the examples given where the word ""walm"" is used, each instance is followed by a color repeated three times. The colors are not random; they correspond with the word preceding ""walm."" Specifically:

- ""zup walm"" resulted in ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""lug walm"" resulted in ""blue blue blue""
- ""dax walm"" resulted in ""green green green""

There appears to be a direct mapping from the nonce word preceding ""walm"" to a specific color being repeated three times. As ""wif"" and ""bluf"" follow ""walm"" and result in ""green red"" and ""red red"" respectively (in the first example), these do not seem to follow the same mapping, indicating their color outputs are determined by rules not directly related to ""walm.""

Hence, the rule for the meaning of ""walm"" appears to be that when ""walm"" follows another word that maps to a color, the output is that color repeated three times. The rule does not specify what happens when ""walm"" is followed by other words, as the examples do not provide enough information for those cases.

So the rule is:
walm -> When following a word that corresponds to a color, output that color three times.",1.0,54,walm
"walm -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" refers to the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that precedes it three times.

Rule: If a color word is followed by the word ""walm,"" then the output should be the color corresponding to the preceding word repeated three times.",1.0,54,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color that correlates with the word that precedes it. For instance, when ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"", comes before ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" Similarly, when ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue""; and when ""dax"" comes before ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,55,lug
"Based on the input and output examples provided, we can induce the following rule:

"Considering the examples provided where the nonce word ""wif"" is used, and correlating the occurrences of ""wif"" with the output colors given:

- Every time ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" appears in the output.
- The position of ""wif"" in the input does not affect the corresponding output; it is always ""red"" regardless of position.
- The occurrence of other words such as ""walm,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" produce different colors, but ""wif"" consistently produces ""red.""

Given this information, it can be deduced that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,55,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each instance of ""wif"" corresponds with the output ""red."" 

Here are the specific instances that illustrate this:

1. wif walm -> red red red
2. zup lug wif dax lug -> yellow blue red green blue
3. wif dax -> red green
4. zup dax wif zup -> yellow green red yellow
5. lug wif lug walm zup walm wif -> blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" is consistently produced in the output.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,55,wif
"Based on the examples provided:

- ""walm"" consistently results in ""red red red"" (input 1 and duplicated in input 5 for the word ""walm""), which indicates that ""walm"" is likely to mean ""red"".
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" as seen in inputs 2 and 5.
- ""dax"" translates to ""green"" as seen in inputs 2, 3, and 4.

Now for the nonce word ""wif"":

- Each time ""wif"" appears in an input, the word ""red"" is part of the output. The ""red"" from ""wif"" cannot be from ""lug"", ""dax"", or ""zup"" since those correspond to ""blue"", ""green"", and ""yellow"" respectively.

Given the consistent appearance of ""red"" in the output and the known translation of other words, we can deduce:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red"".",1.0,55,wif
"wif -> red

"Based on the given examples, ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position within the input. Thus, the underlying rule seems to be that ""wif"" directly corresponds to this color.

"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" follows in the output sequence.

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,55,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the correlation between the input words and the respective color outputs:

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

In the first example, ""wif"" and ""bluf"" both produce ""red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" could be interpreted as the same color as the word preceding it. However, there's not enough information here to confirm this rule since it's the first occurrence.

Input: dax bluf zup
Output: green green yellow

Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the output is ""green green."" This supports the hypothesis that ""bluf"" assumes the color of the preceding word. The following word, ""zup,"" produces a different color, yellow.

Input: lug bluf dax bluf
Output: blue blue green green

Again, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the output is ""blue blue,"" while the last ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and produces ""green green."" This further supports the idea that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word before it.

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow,"" like the color for ""zup,"" which is consistent with our rule.

Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax
Output: green green yellow yellow green

The pattern holds: ""bluf"" after ""dax"" gives ""green,"" and ""bluf"" after ""zup"" gives ""yellow."" The repeated color indicates that ""bluf"" is indeed imitating the color of the word that comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.",1.0,55,bluf
"By comparing the input strings with their corresponding output strings, one can try to deduce the pattern or rule associated with the word ""bluf.""

In each output sequence, the word ""bluf"" seems to result in the color word that comes immediately before it repeating in the output sequence. For instance:

- In ""wif bluf dax,"" ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and following ""bluf,"" ""red"" is repeated.
- In ""dax bluf zup,"" ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and after ""bluf,"" ""green"" is repeated.
- In ""lug bluf dax bluf,"" ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and after the first ""bluf,"" ""blue"" is repeated; then ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and after the second ""bluf,"" ""green"" is repeated.
- In ""dax zup bluf,"" ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" and after ""bluf,"" ""yellow"" is repeated.
- In ""dax bluf zup bluf dax,"" the word ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word preceding it; ""dax"" is followed by ""green,"" and ""zup"" by ""yellow,"" respectively, after each ""bluf.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

**Rule: ""bluf"" prompts the repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it in the output sequence.**

Therefore:
bluf -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: ""bluf"" causes the previous color word to be repeated in the output.",1.0,55,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs:

- Whenever we see the word ""dax"" before ""bluf,"" the output immediately after ""red"" or ""green"" is repeated. For example:
  Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
  Input: lug bluf dax bluf -> Output: blue blue green green
  Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax -> Output: green green yellow yellow green

- Every time ""bluf"" appears after ""dax,"" the next color is the same as the one just before ""bluf."" For example:
  Input: dax bluf zup -> Output: green green yellow
  Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to replicate or repeat the previously mentioned color.

- Additionally, when ""bluf"" is in between two words (other than ""dax""), the output is yellow for both words surrounding ""bluf."" For example:
  Input: dax bluf zup -> Output: green green yellow
  Input: zup bluf dax -> Output: yellow yellow green

- Lastly, when ""bluf"" is at the beginning of a sequence, the output sequence starts with ""red red,"" then follows the rule for the next word. For example:
  Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green

Based on these observations, ""bluf"" seems to indicate repetition or a continuation of the previous color mentioned in its rule context. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it repeats the color that corresponds to ""dax."" When between two different words, ""bluf"" causes the output to be yellow for both surrounding words. When it starts the sequence, there's a default output of ""red red."" Therefore, our rule for ""bluf"" is:

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the color in the output sequence to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" If ""bluf"" starts the sequence or is not immediately preceded by ""dax,"" a default output or different rule may apply.",0.9,55,bluf
"Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" after the word ""wif,"" to ""green"" after the word ""dax,"" and to ""yellow"" after the word ""zup."" When ""bluf"" precedes another word, it seems to carry over the color of the preceding word if ""dax"" or ""zup"" precede it. However, this is not explicitly shown for ""wif,"" as ""wif"" never precedes ""bluf"" within the examples provided. When ""bluf"" follows itself, it repeats the previous color associated with ""bluf.""",0.8,55,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns in the examples provided:

1. wif bluf dax -> red red green
2. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
3. lug bluf dax bluf -> blue blue green green
4. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
5. dax bluf zup bluf dax -> green green yellow yellow green

Let's look at the color pattern associated with 'bluf':

In example one, 'bluf' is followed by 'dax', and the color pattern is red green. In the second example, 'bluf' follows 'dax' and is followed by 'zup', the color pattern is green yellow. In the third example, 'bluf' follows 'lug' and precedes 'dax', and we see it repeats, with the color pattern being blue green. In the fourth example, 'bluf' follows 'zup', and the color pattern is yellow. In the fifth example, 'dax' surrounds a pair of 'bluf zup', and the pattern we see is green yellow.

When 'dax' is associated with 'bluf' either before or after, the output is consistently green. However, when 'zup' is associated, the output for 'bluf' is yellow. When 'lug' precedes 'bluf', the output is blue.

Based on this, it seems that ""bluf"" replicates the color pattern of the word that comes before it, with the added rule that if 'bluf' comes directly after 'zup', it defaults to yellow. 

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word unless it follows 'zup', then it is yellow.",0.8,55,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we must look for patterns in each example.

Analyzing the provided examples:

1. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" 
   Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in other examples, we can isolate ""walm"" as relating to ""red red red.""

2. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red.""
   We can see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" as seen in other examples. ""wif"" does not appear in the Output, so it likely does not translate to a color by itself. The repeating ""walm"" seems to be responsible for ""red red red.""

3. ""lug walm zup walm"" yields ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow.""
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in another example, and we see that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" The repeating ""walm"" is consistent with multiple ""blue"" and ""yellow"" sequences, respectively.

4. ""dax walm"" gives ""green green green.""
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" The Output indicates that ""walm"" is translating to repeated ""green.""

5. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
   Similar to the previous examples, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" is translating to repeated ""yellow.""

By examining the outputs, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color word that comes immediately before it. The repetitions are consistent with the threefold appearance of the color word.

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. ""walm"" causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times.

Hence, the overall rule regarding the nonce word ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> The color word before ""walm"" is repeated three times.",1.0,55,walm
Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the color word before it,1.0,55,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a color repeated three times. Each instance of ""walm"" is translated into three instances of the same color in the Output. The color that ""walm"" becomes seems to be dependent on the word that comes immediately before it.

From the given examples:

- ""zup wif walm"" yields ""yellow red red red""
- ""dax zup walm wif walm"" yields ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red""
- ""lug walm zup walm"" yields ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow""
- ""dax walm"" yields ""green green green""
- ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow""

Based on these observations, here is the rule for what ""walm"" means:

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, it takes on the color associated with the preceding word and repeats it three times. If ""walm"" is the first word or follows an unrecognized word, then there is no color associated, which is not demonstrated in the examples given. Here are the associations we can make from the examples:

- ""zup"" before ""walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""wif"" before ""walm"" -> ""red red red""
- ""dax"" before ""walm"" -> ""green green green""
- ""lug"" before ""walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" based on the given examples is that it acts as a color multiplier for the preceding color word, multiplying it three times.

walm -> A color word that repeats the color of the preceding word three times.",0.9,55,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in the inputs and corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup wif walm

2. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

3. Input: lug walm zup walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

When examining the outputs, each instance of ""walm"" consistently corresponds with a repetition of three of the same colors. The specific color that is repeated three times appears to be determined by the word that comes directly before ""walm"":

- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green""
- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue""

Given these observations, we can deduce a rule for the meaning of ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> When preceding a color word, walm means to repeat that color three times.",0.8,55,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine each input and corresponding output to identify any patterns:

- In ""zup wif walm,"" ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" also corresponds to ""red.""
- In ""dax zup walm wif walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" to ""red.""
- In ""lug walm zup walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

""Dax"" causes ""bluf"" to be green while both ""wif"" and ""zup"" result in ""bluf"" being yellow. There isn't a case in these examples where ""bluf"" appears at the beginning of an input to predict its color independently, but given the information we have, we can assert the following rule based on the relationship between ""bluf"" and the preceding word:

Rule: The color of ""bluf"" depends on the word immediately preceding it. If the preceding word is ""dax,"" ""bluf"" is green. If the preceding word is ""wif"" or ""zup,"" ""bluf"" is yellow.",0.9,56,bluf
"By examining the patterns in the examples given, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Let's look at each occurrence of ""walm"":

1. In ""zup walm lug wif bluf,"" ""walm"" is followed by three ""yellow"" and then the colors change to match the other words (""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red"").
2. In ""lug walm,"" ""walm"" results in three repetitions of ""blue,"" the color associated with ""lug.""
3. In ""lug wif dax walm zup,"" after ""walm"" the output is three ""green"" (the color associated with ""dax"") followed by ""yellow"" associated with ""zup.""
4. In ""wif dax lug walm,"" after ""walm"" the output is three ""blue"" which corresponds to the word ""lug.""
5. In ""dax walm zup,"" after ""walm"" the output is three ""green"" which corresponds to the word ""dax"" before it switches to ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

From these patterns, we can infer that ""walm"" causes the next word's color to be output three times in sequence, before reverting back to the usual color pattern.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the following word to be repeated three times.",1.0,56,walm
"From the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it in the input, with the color repeated three times. Here is the analysis:

- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"", so ""walm"" takes the color of ""lug"" (blue) and repeats it three times.
- ""dax walm zup"" translates to ""green green green yellow"", so ""walm"" takes the color of ""dax"" (green) and repeats it three times, followed by the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow).
- In ""wif dax lug walm"", the output associated with ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue"", which is the color associated with the preceding word ""lug"" repeated three times.

Here's the rule based on the examples:

Rule: walm -> Causes the output to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.",1.0,56,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to have a rule related to color repetition. Specifically, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the previous word a variable number of times. Here's the breakdown as per each example:

- In ""zup walm lug wif bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" ""Walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times.
- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.
- In ""lug wif dax walm zup,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times.
- In ""wif dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.
- In ""dax walm zup,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times.

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the color of the immediately preceding word to repeat three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,56,walm
Rule: walm -> the color of the word that immediately precedes 'walm' repeated three times.,1.0,56,walm
"From the examples provided, we can observe the pattern in the outputs related to the appearance of the word ""walm"" in the inputs:

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
- Here ""walm"" is followed by ""lug wif bluf,"" and we see that the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times (equal to the number of words after ""walm""), and then the expected colors for ""lug"" (blue), ""wif"" (red), and an additional ""red"" for ""bluf"" follow.

Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue
- Here ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue"" repeated three times (equal to the number of words before ""walm"").

Input: lug wif dax walm zup -> Output: blue red green green green yellow
- In this example, ""walm"" is preceded by three words and followed by ""zup."" The output shows ""green"" repeated three times after three initial colors, and then followed by ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

Input: wif dax lug walm -> Output: red green blue blue blue
- Here ""walm"" follows three words, and the output shows ""blue"" repeated three times after the colors for each of the three preceding words.

Input: dax walm zup -> Output: green green green yellow
- ""Walm"" is after ""dax"" and before ""zup,"" with the output showing ""green"" repeated three times (equal to the number of words before ""walm"" plus one) followed by ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

From these observations, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, it results in the color of the preceding word being repeated in the output as many times as the total count of words after ""walm"" including ""walm"" itself, followed by the sequence of colors for the remaining words in the input.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" can be described as:

Walm -> Causes the output before it to repeat a number of times equal to the number of words after it, including ""walm"" itself.",0.8,56,walm
"From the provided examples, it is evident that ""lug"" consistently maps to the color ""blue."" Every example that includes the word ""lug"" results in ""blue"" being part of the output sequence. Hence, we can induce that ""lug"" denotes the color ""blue.""

"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

1. Whenever the word ""lug"" appears alone, the output is ""blue.""

   Output: blue

2. Whenever ""lug"" precedes other words, there seems to be a pattern of blue followed by repetition of a color that correlates to the word following ""lug.""

3. Similarly, when ""lug"" follows other words, the color before ""lug"" is ""yellow,"" followed by ""blue"" which is the output for ""lug.""
   Input: zup lug
   Output: yellow blue

4. When ""lug"" is surrounded by other nonce words, the pattern of colors before ""lug"" might still hold as ""yellow"" wherever it appears in the sequence and then ""blue,"" which appears to be constant for ""lug"".
   Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green

Therefore, the rule appears to be that the word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" and may sometimes be preceded by ""yellow"" depending on its position in a sequence with respect to other nonce words.

5. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf | Output: yellow green yellow green red red

In each instance where ""bluf"" appears, there are two repeated colors following it in the output, irrespective of what preceded ""bluf."" This reliable occurrence across all given examples suggests that ""bluf"" corresponds to a repetition of the color word that follows it in the input list. 

Moreover, it is important to notice that the repeated color in the output corresponds to the word that comes directly after ""bluf"" in the input, translated to its color:

- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""

"To figure out the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze each example's input and corresponding output. We'll look for patterns related to the presence of ""bluf"" in the inputs and changes in the outputs.

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

In this example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red."" It could mean that ""bluf"" is redundant or an intensifier for the word before it, which in this case, is ""wif.""

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" again, which supports the possibility that ""bluf"" is intensifying or duplicating the preceding color.

Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow

In this sequence, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the corresponding output is ""yellow"" again, which fits the pattern of ""bluf"" repeating the output corresponding to the word before it.

Input: wif zup bluf lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue

Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" ends with ""blue."" The ""bluf"" after ""zup"" results in another ""yellow,"" which is consistent with our previous observations that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word.

Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
Output: yellow green yellow green red red

This input has a repeating pattern of ""zup"" and ""dax"" with corresponding colors of ""yellow"" and ""green,"" respectively. The last two words ""wif bluf"" result in ""red red,"" which again suggests that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word just before it.

- ""dax walm wif bluf"" results in ""green green green red red"" – ""dax"" means ""green"", ""walm"" seemingly corresponds to ""green"" again, ""wif"" is ""red"" again, followed by a repeating ""red"" signifying ""bluf"".
- ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" results in ""yellow yellow red green red yellow"" – ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and is repeated, ""wif"" is ""red"", ""dax"" is ""green"", ""wif"" is ""red"" again, and finally, ""zup"" is ""yellow"".
- ""wif zup bluf lug"" results in ""red yellow yellow blue"" – ""wif"" is ""red"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""bluf"" repeats the ""yellow"", and ""lug"" is ""blue"".

- 'dax' corresponds to 'green'
- 'walm' has no prior example, but given it also outputs 'green', we cannot ascertain its specific meaning yet.

However, this rule does not hold in other examples because ""bluf"" is not always preceded by ""wif"" (which translates to ""red""). 

Another observation is that ""bluf"" translates to a double occurrence of a color, regardless of its position or the color that precedes it. If we look at the first, second, and fifth examples, we see that the color ""red"" is repeated at the output when ""bluf"" is present in the input.

Here's the rule induction based on the given examples:

- In ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" (yellow yellow yellow blue red red), ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and thus repeats ""yellow"" three times.
- In ""dax walm wif walm"" (green green green red red red), ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in ""green"" repeated three times, but because it's followed by ""wif,"" the sequence ends with ""red."" Another ""walm"" follows, indicating three more ""red"" as it occurs after ""wif.""
- In ""lug walm wif zup wif"" (blue blue blue red yellow red), ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" repeating ""blue"" thrice, and because it's followed by ""wif,"" it ends with ""red.""
- In ""dax walm wif dax"" (green green green red green), ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and repeats ""green"" thrice, and again due to ""wif,"" it ends with ""red."" Then another ""dax"" follows, resulting in ""green.""
- In ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" (blue green yellow green green green red), ""walm"" occurs after ""dax,"" thus repeating ""green"" three times, and then it ends with ""red"" because of the subsequent ""wif.""

So the rule for ""walm"" seems to be: After a color word, repeat that color three times. If ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" add ""red"" to the end of the sequence.

"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to correlate with repeating the color associated with the previous word. Each time ""bluf"" is used, the output repeats the color that corresponds to the word that came right before it. Here is the correlation based on each example:

- wif bluf: red red (since ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""bluf"" also corresponds to red)
- lug bluf: blue blue (since ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""bluf"" also corresponds to blue)
- zup bluf: yellow yellow (since ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""bluf"" also corresponds to yellow)
- wif bluf lug dax wif: red red blue green red (since ""wif"" is red, ""bluf"" repeats red; ""lug"" is blue, ""dax"" is new and correlates with green, and the last ""wif"" is back to red)

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" means to repeat the color of the previous word.",1.0,58,bluf
"Reviewing the provided examples, let's analyze the patterns to identify the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

1. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

2. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red

3. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

5. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow

Looking at the outputs, whenever 'walm' is introduced in the input, a sequence of the same color followed by a 'red' appears in the output. It is important to note the number of repeated colors before the 'red' appears:

- In example 1, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', and after 'walm', we see three 'blue' outputs before the 'red'.
- In example 2, 'walm' is at the end and there are three 'red' after 'wif' which corresponds to 'red'.
- In example 3, 'walm' follows 'zup' which corresponds to 'yellow', and there are three 'yellow' outputs before the 'red'.
- In example 4, 'lug' which represents 'blue' is followed by 'walm', resulting in three 'blue' instances before a 'red'.
- In example 5, 'walm' follows 'wif' which represents 'red', and there are three 'red' before the 'yellow' corresponding to zup.

From the patterns observed, we can deduce the following rules:
- 'Walm' causes the color that precedes it to be repeated three times in the output before a 'red' is added.

Therefore, we can write the rule for 'walm' as:

walm -> repeat the preceding color three times followed by a red",1.0,58,walm
"Rule: walm means to repeat the last color mentioned before it, three times. 

For example:

- In ""lug walm wif lug bluf"", ""lug"" means blue, so ""walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"".
- In ""lug wif zup wif walm"", the last color before ""walm"" is red from ""wif"", therefore ""walm"" translates to ""red red red"".
- In ""zup walm wif"", ""zup"" is yellow, so ""walm"" means ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In ""dax lug walm"", ""lug"" means blue, leading to ""walm"" equaling ""blue blue blue"".
- In ""wif walm zup"", ""wif"" stands for red, hence ""walm"" results in ""red red red"".

walm -> repeat the last color mentioned before it, three times.",1.0,58,walm
"Based on the patterns presented in the examples:

- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"".
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"".

When ""walm"" appears in a sequence, it causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to be repeated. There is no instance of ""walm"" standing alone or at the beginning, so we cannot assess its behavior in isolation. However, given the examples:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue"", indicating that ""lug"" (blue) is repeated.
- In the second example, after ""wif zup wif walm"", we see ""red yellow red red red"", meaning the sequence causes ""wif"" (red) to be repeated.
- In the third example, ""zup walm wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow red"", so ""zup"" (yellow) is repeated due to ""walm"".
- In the fourth example, ""dax lug walm"" causes ""blue"" to be said three times after ""lug"" (blue), indicating a repetition of ""lug"".
- In the final example, ""wif walm zup"" results in ""red red red yellow"", so ""wif"" (red) is repeated due to ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to be repeated.",1.0,58,walm
"To deduce the meaning or rule for the word ""walm,"" let's examine each example and look for a pattern:

1. When ""walm"" is after ""lug,"" the output sequence has ""blue blue"".
2. When ""walm"" is the last word after ""wif,"" the output shows ""red red.""
3. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
4. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" with a preceding ""dax,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
5. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" before ""zup,"" the output is ""red red.""

We notice the word that comes before ""walm"" seems to matter. ""Lug"" leads to ""blue,"" ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and ""zup"" leads to ""yellow.""

From the given information, walm appears to repeat the color associated with the word directly preceding it two times in the output. Hence, the meaning of ""walm"" could be related to duplication or repetition of the preceding word's output. 

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated once.",0.9,58,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the occurrences of the word ""walm"" and the corresponding output:

1. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and is followed by ""wif"" (red), resulting in three blue before one red.

2. lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red
   - ""walm"" is at the end and follows ""wif"" (red), resulting in three red.

3. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and is followed by ""wif"" (red), resulting in three yellow before one red.

4. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) without a following word, resulting in three blue.

5. wif walm zup -> red red red yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and is followed by ""zup"" (yellow), resulting in three red before one yellow.

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color word preceding it three times before the color word that follows it. When ""walm"" is the last word or there is no color word following it, the preceding color is repeated three times. 

Rule: walm -> a repetition of the preceding color word three times followed by the color of the word that comes after, if there is one. If ""walm"" is the final word, repeat the preceding color three times without an additional color afterwards.",0.8,58,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of the context in which it is used. Therefore, the rule for ""lug"" is as follows:

- The word ""bluf"" is not explicitly defined in the examples, but based on the fifth example, it seems to also translate to ""blue.""

"Analyzing the inputs and outputs, we can make the following observations:

- In every instance where the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, two ""red"" words appear consecutively in the corresponding output.
- The word ""bluf"" does not seem to affect the colors assigned to other words in the inputs.
- The words before ""bluf"" (e.g., ""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""zup"") are translated to colors and do not influence the outcome of ""bluf.""
- No matter the position of ""bluf"" in the input sequence, ""red red"" seems to follow its preceding word's assigned color in the output sequence.

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" corresponds to a double representation of the color ""red."" Thus, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" in the input is translated to ""red red"" in the output, regardless of the surrounding context.

Rule: bluf -> ""red red""",1.0,59,bluf

- Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> Output: green blue yellow red red green
- Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red

4. Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red
5. Input: wif walm lug bluf -> Output: red red red blue blue

From these pairs, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to two ""red"" in the output. In every instance where ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""red red"" appears in the output, regardless of the position of ""bluf"" or the other words around it.

However, we can see from the input that other words could correspond to different colors:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" adds an extra repetition to the following color (observed only once in example 5)

Each of these additional words appears to add a color to the output, and ""walm"" seems to double the frequency of the color that follows it, as seen in example 5.

Summarizing the observed pattern:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""red red"" (or the color red repeated twice).

So, based on the examples provided:
bluf -> meaning ""red red"".",1.0,59,bluf
"To discern the rule for the word ""bluf,"" we'll analyze the outputs correlated with its occurrences in various inputs. Each input begins with a sequence of non-""bluf"" words, each producing a unique color in the output, followed by ""bluf,"" which produces ""red red"" consistently regardless of the preceding word. Additionally, it appears that when ""walm"" and ""lug"" are present before ""bluf,"" the output contains an additional ""blue"" corresponding to ""lug,"" with ""walm"" doubling the color output.

Analyzing the outputs:

1. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
2. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
3. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
4. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
5. The word ""bluf"" consistently results in ""red red,"" regardless of its position or the words around it.
6. With ""walm"" before ""lug"" and ""bluf,"" we see a repetition pattern of red, suggesting that ""walm"" may induce a doubling of color outputs.

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning: When ""bluf"" appears, two ""red"" outputs are produced regardless of context. The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" results in a double ""red"" output. 

Rule: bluf -> ""red red"" (Double Red Output)",0.9,59,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to two color outputs. The word that precedes ""bluf"" seems to indicate which color ""bluf"" is going to be output as. Let's analyze the examples one by one:

1. Input: wif bluf

Based on these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the color that precedes it. If no color is mentioned before ""bluf"", such as in the first example, ""bluf"" takes the color associated with the preceding non-color word.

Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

Based on these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" mirrors the color of the word that comes immediately after it, except when it is at the end of a sequence where it repeats the color of the preceding word. However, in the second example, ""bluf"" is between ""zup"" and ""wif"" and the output is ""yellow red"". Since ""wif"" doesn't have a color but a term ""red"" is present, it seems ""bluf"" does not always adopt the following color, unless it's a color term. In the case of ""wif"", it defaults to repeating the previous color. 

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the immediately following word when it is a color term, otherwise, it repeats the color of the immediately preceding word.
",0.9,60,bluf
"Based on the outputs corresponding to the inputs where the nonce word ""bluf"" is used, it seems that ""bluf"" changes the color mentioned before it to yellow, except when it is preceded by ""dax,"" in which case ""bluf"" becomes green. Furthermore, in the absence of a preceding color (e.g., ""dax bluf""), ""bluf"" repeats the existing color.

Let's verify with the provided examples:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug."" Every time ""lug"" appears, it corresponds to ""blue."" After ""bluf,"" ""blue"" is repeated.

2. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" Therefore ""bluf"" causes the following color to be ""yellow,"" except when following ""dax"" where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" as seen with ""dax wif"" leading to ""green red.""

3. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the ""bluf"" after ""zup"" also corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   As mentioned earlier, without a preceding color ""bluf"" simply repeats the color corresponding to ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

5. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
   Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
   ""bluf"" after ""zup"" turns to ""yellow,""  and ""bluf"" after ""lug"" turns to ""blue."" ""bluf"" after ""dax"" is ""green,"" followed by a repeating pattern of the colors corresponding to ""lug,"" then another ""bluf"" which repeats ""blue,"" followed by ""dax"" as ""green"" and ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"" at the end.

Rule: bluf -> When following ""lug,"" ""zup,"" or in absence of a preceding color, repeats the last color. When following ""dax,"" it turns green.",0.8,60,bluf
"Observing the position of ""bluf"" in all the inputs and the corresponding outputs, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" in every case except when it directly follows ""lug,"" in which case the output is ""red.""

Here is the deduction based on each input-output pair:

- When ""lug bluf"" appears, the output is ""blue red.""
- When ""bluf"" appears without ""lug"" before it, the output is ""blue.""
- When ""zup bluf dax lug bluf"" appears, the first ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow,"" matching the color for ""zup,"" while the ""bluf"" after ""lug"" translates to ""red"" followed by ""blue"" after ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be influenced by the word that appears before ""bluf."" The specific rule that can be deduced is:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" it translates to ""red""; otherwise, it translates to ""yellow"" if followed by ""zup,"" to ""green"" if followed by ""dax,"" and ""blue"" otherwise.",0.8,60,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> the color that does not appear in the preceding sequence of colors. If all four colors (blue, red, green, yellow) are present, then ""bluf"" represents yellow. If ""bluf"" is the first word in the sequence, it represents blue.
",0.2,60,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" correlates with the color ""yellow."" Here's how the rule is applied based on each input and its corresponding output:

- Example 1: ""wif walm dax zup"" leads to ""red red red green yellow,"" where ""walm"" directly corresponds to a ""yellow"" output.
- Example 2: ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" leads to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red,"" where ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow.""
- Example 3: ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"" where again ""walm"" correlates with the ""yellow.""
- Example 4: ""wif zup walm dax zup"" leads to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow,"" with ""walm"" surrounded by ""yellow"" in the output.
- Example 5: ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" leads to ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue,"" and here we see that both occurrences of ""walm"" correspond to ""yellow.""

Rule: walm -> ""yellow""",1.0,60,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" In every example, each instance of the word ""walm"" corresponds to an ""yellow"" in the output. 

Let's test the hypothesis with the given inputs and outputs:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   ""walm"" corresponds to the second ""red"" in the output.

2. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   ""walm"" corresponds to the fourth ""yellow"" in the output.
   
3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   ""walm"" corresponds to the second and third ""yellow"" in the output.
   
4. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   ""walm"" corresponds to the second and third ""yellow"" in the output.
   
5. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   ""walm"" corresponds to the second ""red"" and both ""blue"" occurrences in the output.

Considering all examples, when the word ""walm"" appears in the input, the color ""yellow"" appears in the output, often in the position directly corresponding to the word ""walm.""

Therefore the rule can be written as:
walm -> yellow",1.0,60,walm
"Given the examples, it appears that each instance of ""walm"" in the input corresponds to a sequential repetition of the color ""yellow"" in the output. 

Notice that every time ""walm"" is mentioned in the input, there are equal amounts of additional ""yellow"" after the current one already corresponding to the ""walm."" Here’s the evidence from the input-output pairs:

- In the first example, ""wif walm dax zup"" outputs ""red red red green yellow."" ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The ""walm"" precedes the last ""yellow,"" suggesting that it's another ""yellow.""

- The second example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" gives ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" to ""red."" Each ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" After these direct correlations, the extra ""yellow"" follows ""walm,"" indicating that ""walm"" produces one more ""yellow"" than the count of ""zup.""

- The third example, ""zup walm,"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow."" With just one ""zup"" for ""yellow,"" the presence of ""walm"" leads to two more ""yellow"" outputs.

- The fourth example, ""wif zup walm dax zup,"" results in ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow."" In this case, the pattern holds true with ""walm"" correlating to repetitive ""yellow"" colors in sequence.

- The fifth example, ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm,"" outputs ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue."" This final case solidifies that ""walm"" is related to repetitive ""yellow"" outputs, but since the sequence is broken by other words (""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""zup""), it starts the count of ""yellow"" colors again after each interruption.

Rule: walm -> ""yellow"" repeated as many times as there are ""walm"" words consecutively, reset by any other word.",1.0,60,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm"", let's analyze the input-output pairs.

- In every instance where ""walm"" appears in the input:
  - The output ""yellow"" follows.

This pattern suggests that ""walm"" corresponds to the output ""yellow"".

Now, we must check this against the other words in the inputs to ensure there's no overlap or additional context that changes this rule:

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"".
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"".
- ""zup"" usually corresponds to ""yellow"", except when followed by ""walm"", in which case ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow"". This suggests that ""zup"" does not change its meaning when adjacent to ""walm"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".

Considering all these correspondences and the fact that ""walm"" always results in a ""yellow"" output regardless of its position or the words around it, we can determine the rule:

walm -> yellow.",1.0,60,walm
"Considering the provided inputs and their respective outputs, the word walm seems to influence the color output immediately following it. In every instance where ""walm"" appears, the word directly after ""walm"" translates to the color ""yellow"". 

Here are the observations based on each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   Observation: ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"", which yields ""red"". However, ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"", which changes the sequence, suggesting ""zup"" affects the output.

2. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   Observation: ""walm"" is again followed by ""dax"", which this time yields ""yellow"", suggesting ""zup"" might have an impact on how ""dax"" is interpreted when it comes after ""walm"".

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Observation: ""walm"" is at the end and the output is still ""yellow"", confirming the word after ""walm"" determines the color.

4. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   Observation: The appearance of ""walm"" precedes a sequence of ""yellow"" outputs, independent of what follows.

5. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm 
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   Observation: ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" and then ""zup"", both of which yield ""red"" and ""green"" when not preceded by ""walm"". The word ""lug"" after ""wif"" produces ""blue"", which changes when ""walm"" is the subsequent word, further indicating the influence of ""walm"" on the color that follows.

Given these observations, it appears that ""walm"" changes the color output of the word that follows it to ""yellow,"" regardless of what that word's output would normally be without ""walm"" preceding it.

Rule: The presence of the word ""walm"" in a sequence changes the expected color output of the following word to ""yellow"". 

Therefore the rule is:

walm -> the following word translates to the color ""yellow"".",0.8,60,walm

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds with the color ""green"" in the output. Whether ""dax"" is at the beginning, middle, or end of the input sequence, its associated output is always ""green."" Therefore, we can deduce the rule that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""

"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,61,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to the word ""green"" in the output. In each case, regardless of the surrounding words, the presence of ""dax"" in the input correlates to ""green"" in the output.

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the exact same position in the output.

Example 1: dax walm wif -> green green green red
Example 2: wif lug zup -> red blue yellow

Example 4: wif zup bluf wif dax -> red yellow yellow red green
Example 5: dax zup lug wif lug -> green yellow blue red blue

Rule: wif -> meaning. Meaning: ""wif"" means ""red"".",1.0,61,wif
"Based on the above examples, we can deduce the following:

""dax"" corresponds to ""green"",

Thus, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the given outputs.",1.0,61,zup
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""yellow"".",1.0,61,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that each word is associated with a specific color in the output. The word ""bluf"" directly corresponds to the color ""red"" in all instances where 'bluf' is present. It's also noticeable that the colors associated with ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup"" appear to be ""green,"" ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""yellow"" respectively.

Here's the breakdown:

- ""dax"" always results in ""green""
- ""wif"" always results in ""red""
- ""lug"" always results in ""blue""
- ""zup"" always results in ""yellow""

From these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,61,bluf
"Observing the examples given and the respective outputs, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" when it appears after the word ""wif"" and corresponds to the color ""green"" when it appears after the word ""dax."" When ""bluf"" appears immediately after ""zup"" or at the beginning, it translates to the color ""yellow"". However, we also see ""bluf"" translating to ""yellow"" after ""zup"" followed by ""wif"" and ""dax,"" which means the output color may depend on the previous and subsequent words together since ""dax"" normally leads to ""green.""

Since we don't see ""bluf"" followed by other words except for ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" and we also don't see it influenced by ""lug,"" we cannot generalize its meaning beyond its relation to these words. There's no direct output related to ""lug bluf"" to identify if ""bluf"" has an independent meaning with ""lug"" preceding it.

Based on the information provided and the instances where ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the most consistent rule appears to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" when it immediately follows ""zup,"" translates to ""green"" when it immediately follows ""dax,"" and translates to ""red"" when it immediately follows ""wif."" Without sufficient data after ""lug,"" no rule regarding ""bluf"" can be determined.

Therefore, we could state:

bluf -> meaning:
- After ""zup"" -> yellow
- After ""dax"" -> green
- After ""wif"" -> red
(No consistent rule found after ""lug"" due to lack of examples)",0.8,61,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look at its correlation with the provided outputs. Let's observe the position of ""bluf"" within the inputs and the corresponding output colors:

- When ""bluf"" is preceded and followed by a word (dax, zup), the output is green for the preceding and yellow for the following word.
- When ""bluf"" stands between two words that are part of the input (wif, lug), the output is red for the preceding and blue for the following word.
- If ""bluf"" is at the end after one word (wif), the output is red for the preceding word.
- When ""bluf"" follows a word without another word after it (zup), the output is yellow.
- The sequence (zup bluf wif dax wif zup) yields the pattern: yellow for both instances of zup, red for wif, and green for dax, notwithstanding their positions relative to bluf.

From these observations, it appears that the output color is not determined by the relative position of ""bluf"" alone but also seems influenced by the word that comes before ""bluf.""

Let's apply this pattern to other words:

- ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is green.
- So ""dax"" seems to map to green.
- ""zup"" whether it precedes or follows ""bluf"" maps to yellow.
- ""wif"" when it precedes or follows ""bluf"" maps to red.
- ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" once and the output is blue.

Given the data, it is unclear what the standalone rule for ""bluf"" is since its presence does not seem to change the color that is associated with the other words around it. Instead, it seems that ""bluf"" may serve as a placeholder and the surrounding words determine the color output. 

So the rule may be as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" acts as a neutral word that does not affect the color but maintains the color pattern attributed to the words around it. It does not have its own color output but allows the colors of adjacent words to be expressed without alteration.",0.8,61,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,0.0,61,bluf
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.,1.0,61,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. Here's how the rule appears to translate:

- In ""lug walm wif zup wif,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and we then see ""blue blue blue"" after ""walm,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes the color before it (blue) to repeat three times.
- In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, and we have ""green green green"" following ""walm,"" showing the repetition of green three times.
- In ""wif bluf dax walm,"" we don't know what ""bluf"" corresponds to, but following ""dax"" and ""walm,"" we see green repeated three times, just like before.
- In ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm,"" blue is repeated three times.
- In ""lug walm,"" again, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and we see blue repeated three times following ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> The rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the color word immediately preceding it to be output three times.",1.0,61,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to repeat the previous color word multiple times. Here is the observed pattern:

2. dax walm -> green green green

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color term two additional times.",1.0,61,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the input and output that correlate with the presence of ""walm"" and other known elements.

From the outputs, we can see a pattern in the repetition of the same color whenever ""walm"" is present. We can use the consistent elements in different inputs to figure out what ""walm"" represents:

- When ""lug walm"" is inputted, the output is ""blue blue blue."" Since ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and we have three repeat instances of ""blue,"" it suggests ""walm"" might mean repeat the previous color two more times.
- When ""dax walm"" is inputted, the output is ""green green green."" Since ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and we have three repeat instances of ""green,"" it supports the idea that ""walm"" might mean repeat the previous color two more times.
- When ""wif bluf dax walm"" is inputted, the output is ""red red green green green."" ""Wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""bluf"" has no associated color, and ""dax"" translates to ""green."" Despite ""bluf"" being in the input, it does not appear to affect the output, which supports the notion that ""wif"" and ""dax"" are the only color contributors here, and ""walm"" still causes the color ""green"" to be repeated.

The rule for ""walm"" based on the given examples seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it means repeat the color associated with the previous word two more times.

Thus, the meaning of ""walm"" can be deduced as:

walm -> Repeat the previous color two more times.",1.0,61,walm
"Based on the examples provided:

- When 'walm' follows 'lug', 'blue' is repeated three times.
- When 'walm' follows 'dax', 'green' is repeated three times.
- When 'walm' follows 'wif zup wif', 'blue red yellow red' is output, which doesn't follow the same repetition pattern.
- When 'walm' is alone after 'dax', 'green' is repeated three times.
- When 'walm' follows 'wif bluf dax', 'green' is repeated three times after the initial 'red red'.

It seems that 'walm' causes a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. If 'lug' precedes 'walm', then 'blue' is repeated three times. If 'dax' precedes it, then 'green' is repeated three times. However, the example with 'wif zup wif' doesn't fit this repetition pattern, which might indicate an exception to the rule or an additional rule for that specific sequence of inputs.

Considering the information we have, the working rule could be that 'walm' causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times, with some exceptions or additional rules possibly affecting the output pattern.

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" seems to precede a word whose corresponding color is then changed to green in the output. Thus, if we consider ""dax"" to be an operation that changes the subsequent color to green, we can derive the following relations:

- ""lug walm dax wif"" results in ""blue blue blue green,"" meaning that ""dax"" changed ""wif"" which would have been red to green.

- ""wif bluf dax bluf"" results in ""red red green green,"" where the first ""bluf"" remains red, but the one following ""dax"" turns green.

- ""lug dax bluf"" gives us ""blue green green,"" showing that ""bluf"" which would have been red, is changed to green after ""dax.""

- ""zup dax"" simply yields ""yellow green,"" confirming that whatever word follows ""dax"" is transformed into green.

- lug dax wif lug -> blue green red blue

   The word ""wif"" typically corresponds to ""red,"" but after ""dax"" it is ""green.""

From these examples, it seems that ""dax"" signals a change in the output color sequence, specifically to ""green"" regardless of the word that follows it. Therefore, ""dax"" likely represents a transition rule that changes the next word's output to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> Change the next color output to green.",1.0,62,dax
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze the patterns where it appears and the corresponding output colors:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears, the following color is green.
2. ""Dax"" never appears as the last word in the input, so there's no example of it standing alone without a following word.
3. The word after ""dax"" does not consistently translate to the same color output (it is blue, green, or red depending on context).
4. The word preceding ""dax"" does not affect the color that follows ""dax""; it always leads to green regardless of the preceding word.

From these observations, we can infer the following rule:

The evidence lies in the second and fourth examples:

The same pattern applies to 'zup walm dax lug', where 'zup' translates to 'yellow' followed by 'walm' repeating 'yellow' three times, and 'lug' translates to 'blue' as established.

"Based on the given examples, we can induce a rule for the nonce word ""walm"". It seems that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color that is mentioned before it, with the number of repetitions being three. For example:

- In the first example, ""lug"" is before ""walm"" and the output for ""lug"" is ""blue"", followed by three ""blue"" for ""walm"".
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- The third and fourth examples also have ""walm"" follow ""lug"", and like in the first example, this results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color indicated by the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times.",1.0,62,walm
"To determine the meaning or rule behind the word ""walm,"" let's break down the examples given:

2. zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow green blue
3. lug walm zup -> blue blue blue yellow
4. lug walm -> blue blue blue
5. lug walm -> blue blue blue

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" has the effect of repeating the color associated with the word that precedes it three additional times. The pattern shows that every time ""walm"" is used after a word, the color of that word is outputted three more times. For instance, ""lug"" correlates to the color blue, and when ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" we see blue repeated three more times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. Rule: If X is the color associated with the word before ""walm,"" then ""walm"" causes the output of X X X.",1.0,62,walm
"walm -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, ""walm"" seems to correspond to the repetition of the color that comes after the word ""walm"".

Similarly, in the second example ""zup walm dax lug"", the output ""yellow yellow yellow green blue"" follows the same pattern, repeating the color that comes after ""walm"" (which is ""yellow"" in this case) three times before continuing with the usual sequence.

"The examples provided indicate a correlation between the input and corresponding colors in the output. To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze each example:

5. Input: dax walm

2. ""wif"" and ""walm"" translate to ""red,"" with repetition indicating multiple ""red"" outputs.
3. ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

When ""dax"" is present in the sequence, it is translated to ""green"" every time.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,63,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Explanation of rule induction:

From the examples provided, it can be observed that whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output, independent of the other words present. The position of ""dax"" in the input sequence does not affect its output; it consistently translates to ""green"".

Here are the observations that lead to this rule:
- Input: lug dax -> Output: blue green (dax corresponds to green)
- Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow (dax corresponds to green)
- Input: zup lug dax lug -> Output: yellow blue green blue (dax corresponds to green)
- Input: zup dax -> Output: yellow green (dax corresponds to green)
- Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green (dax corresponds to green)

Considering these observations, the rule is clear that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" regardless of its position or the context within the input sequence.",1.0,63,dax
"Based on the provided examples, dax seems to correspond to the color green. However, dax's meaning must be further analyzed in relation to the other words to determine if it always means green regardless of context or if its meaning changes based on surrounding words.

1. In the first example, ""lug dax"" outputs ""blue green,"" and in the third example, ""lug dax lug"" outputs ""blue green blue."" Here, lug consistently corresponds to blue on both sides of dax.

2. In the second example, ""wif walm dax zup"" outputs ""red red red green yellow."" Since wif and walm both output red, it seems that dax outputs green regardless of the words before it, as zup corresponds to yellow following dax.

3. In the fourth example, ""zup dax"" outputs ""yellow green,"" again lining up with zup as yellow and dax as green.

4. Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green,"" where dax is followed by green, but walm is also followed by green, contrasting the second example where it preceded dax and outputted red. This discrepancy suggests that dax in this context may either maintain its meaning as green or influence the output of the following word to also be green.

To summarize these observations, dax appears to always correspond to the output of green, and it does not seem to change the color output of words that follow it, even though walm has shown variable color output. Thus, the rule for dax is consistent and independent of the surrounding context in these examples.

The nonce word ""wif"" appears in every example and the word ""red"" is constantly in the output whenever ""wif"" is present in the input. This consistency across all examples suggests that the word ""wif"" correlates directly to the color ""red.""

"To figure out the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns for each example and the associated colors based on their position in the sentence and correlation to the output.

1. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   - ""wif"" correlates to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" correlates to ""red""
   - ""dax"" correlates to ""green""

2. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   - ""wif"" correlates to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" correlates to ""red""
   - ""lug"" correlates to ""blue""

3. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   - ""wif"" correlates to ""red""
   - ""dax"" correlates to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" correlates to ""green""

4. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
   Output: green green red yellow blue
   - ""dax"" correlates to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" correlates to ""green""
   - ""wif"" correlates to ""red""
   - ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" correlates to ""blue""

5. Input: zup wif bluf zup
   Output: yellow red red yellow
   - ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" correlates to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" correlates to ""red""
   - ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow""

From these examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" does not have a consistent color output associated with it. Instead, the output color of ""bluf"" seems to depend on the word that comes before it. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red""; when it follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green"". This suggests that ""bluf"" might copy the output color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> copies the color output of the word before it.",1.0,63,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red

Explanation: In each output, the position of ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Regardless of the position of ""bluf"" within the sequence of words, the output color for ""bluf"" is consistently ""red"".",1.0,63,bluf

5. Input: zup wif bluf zup / Output: yellow red red yellow

In examples 1, 2, and 5, the word 'bluf' follows 'wif' and both correspond to 'red' in the output. In example 3, 'bluf' comes after 'dax' and corresponds to 'green'. In example 4, 'bluf' comes after 'dax' once again and corresponds to 'green'. From these observations, it seems that 'bluf' does not have a consistent color output but rather has the same color as the word preceding it in the input.

- Input: zup wif bluf zup | Output: yellow red red yellow

From these examples, it appears that 'bluf' consistently translates to 'red'. However, there are some patterns to consider that may affect other words too:

1. 'wif' seems to always translate to 'red'. 
2. 'dax' translates to 'green' when it appears after 'bluf', but in the fourth example, it is 'green' even when preceding 'bluf'. 
3. 'lug' translates to 'blue' whether it appears after or before 'bluf'.
4. 'zup' translates to 'yellow', independent of its position relative to 'bluf'.

""Walm"" here is followed by three ""red"" colors.

Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

Once again, ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of three colors, this time first by ""red"" and then by ""blue"" after a series of other words.

From these observations, we can deduce a general rule that ""walm"" causes the output color to be repeated three times, matching the color of the word that is immediately preceding ""walm.""

2. In the second example, ""lug"" which is ""blue"" is followed by ""walm"", which results in ""blue"", repeated for each occurrence of ""walm"".
3. In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", so ""walm"" becomes ""yellow"", and the next ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which is ""blue"", so it becomes ""blue"".
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" translating to ""red"", causing ""walm"" to translate to ""red"" as well.
5. The fifth example repeats the behavior seen previously confirming the rule.

walm -> repeat the color of the previous word.",1.0,63,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze how the outputs change with the inclusion of ""walm"" in various inputs. I'll try to isolate the word ""walm"" and see if there's a consistent pattern in the outputs.

1. When ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" (Input: lug walm), the Output is blue blue blue. It seems like ""walm"" might be mimicking the color that appears right before it.

2. When ""walm"" follows ""zup dax"" (Input: zup dax walm), the Output is yellow green green green. Again, ""walm"" seems to continue the color that precedes it, green in this case.

3. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (Input: wif walm), the Output is red red, so ""walm"" takes on the color red, which is the same as the word before it.

4. Even when ""walm"" appears multiple times, each instance of ""walm"" in the Output replicates the color of the word that appears before it (Input: wif lug walm, Output: red blue blue blue).

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the preceding word in the output sequence.

Rule:
walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word.",1.0,63,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to relate to repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"". We can determine this by observing the color that follows the word ""walm"" is identical to the color associated with the word before it. Let's look at each example:

1. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" → yellow green green green blue red
- ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output color for ""walm"" is green, which is the same as ""dax.""

2. ""lug walm"" → blue blue blue
- ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output color for ""walm"" is blue, the same as ""lug.""

3. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" → red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
- ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output color for ""walm"" is yellow, the same as ""zup.""

4. ""wif walm dax zup"" → red red red green yellow
- ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output color for ""walm"" is red, the same as ""wif.""

5. ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" → red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
- The first ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and its color is red, like ""wif.""
- The second ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and its color is blue, like ""lug.""

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.",1.0,63,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the pairs of input and output sequences:

1. Each instance of ""walm"" in the input is associated with ""green"" or ""blue"" in the output.
2. ""Walm"" is the only word that is consistently followed by a single color, despite the context it appears in.

Let's take a look at each example:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" and both yield ""green."" 
- In the second example, ""walm"" stands alone with ""lug"" and both are ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" occurs after ""zup"" and they are both ""yellow,"" while ""lug"" which follows ""walm"" is ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which is associated with ""red"") and the sequence ""wif walm dax zup"" produces ""red red red green yellow.""
- In the fifth example, we see that ""lug walm"" turns into ""blue blue"" and when ""walm"" is the last word, as in ""wif lug walm,"" it results in ""blue blue blue,"" pointing to a pattern.

Analyzing these, a pattern seems to emerge concerning ""walm"":

- When ""walm"" appears, it continues the color of the previous word, with a preference for ""green"" or ""blue,"" as no instances of ""walm"" result in ""yellow"" or ""red"" when not directly following a word associated with these colors.

- ""bluf"" consistently maps to ""green"" when following ""dax,"" and to ""yellow"" when following ""lug"" and ""zup.""
- ""zup"" has only appeared once and mapped to ""yellow.""

However, there is no clear instance of what ""wif"" does independently without other words following it to determine if there are more rules at play or if ""wif"" alone does have a standalone meaning. Based on the examples provided, the current best rule we can induce is:

Rule:
- ""wif"" -> ""red"" (as the first output color)
- Subsequent words (like ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup"") determine the following colors in the output based on their specific mappings.",1.0,64,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the patterns associated with the input and output:

- Input: ""wif dax"" corresponds to Output: ""red green""
- Input: ""wif lug"" corresponds to Output: ""red blue""
- Input: ""wif dax bluf"" corresponds to Output: ""red green green""
- Input: ""wif lug zup bluf"" corresponds to Output: ""red blue yellow yellow""

From these examples, we can see that:

1. Every instance of ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" in the output, suggesting ""wif"" may translate to ""red.""
2. The second word after ""wif"" corresponds to another color:
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
3. Following words each generate a color that is repeated for each occurrence:
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Given the information above, it should be noted that ""wif"" always precedes ""red,"" which seems to be a fixed part of the output regardless of the words following ""wif."" Hence, ""wif"" by itself does not denote a color but likely signifies the beginning of a sequence where the first color is always ""red.""

Rule: ""wif"" signals the start of a color sequence where the first color is always ""red,"" and subsequent words in the input determine the following colors in the output sequence. If a word in the input is repeated, the corresponding color in the output is also repeated.",0.9,64,wif

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow whenever it appears in an input.",1.0,64,zup

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color yellow. Each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" is outputted.",0.2,64,bluf

Rule: When ""bluf"" is encountered in the input, the output is ""red"". This is consistently shown across all examples provided.",0.0,64,bluf
"bluf -> yellow

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" does not change and is consistently translated to the color ""yellow"" in each example.",0.0,64,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns of input and output to uncover any rules that are consistent across examples.

- In the first example, the sequence ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" translates to a pattern of ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, the word ""walm"" corresponded to three ""yellow"" colors in sequence.

- In the second example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red."" Again, the word ""walm"" is followed by a triple color output.

- In the third example, ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue green red red green."" When ""walm"" appears, it follows the color blue repeating three times.

- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" translates to ""red red green green red red red blue red."" The ""walm"" word is followed by three repetitions of the color red.

- In the fifth example, ""wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" Similar to the first example, ""walm"" corresponds to three yellows here.

From these observations, it is consistent that the word ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of three colors. The color seems to be the same as the one that appears immediately before ""walm.""

Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates that the color of the word before it should be repeated three times in the output.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word three times.",1.0,64,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns that relate the input to the output. Let's examine each input-output pair for patterns:

1. zup bluf lug zup walm -> yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
2. wif walm -> red red red
3. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green
4. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> red red green green red red red blue red
5. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow

From these examples, we see that individual words such as ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" and ""dax"" consistently map to colors: ""zup"" to yellow, ""wif"" to red, ""lug"" to blue, ""bluf"" to red, and ""dax"" to green.

Analyzing the outputs linked to ""walm,"" it seems to play a role in repeating the color that came immediately before it. To confirm, let's check:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" follows a ""zup,"" which translates to yellow, and the output is repeated yellows.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), and the output is repeating reds.
3. In the third example, after ""walm,"" which follows a ""lug"" (blue), the output features repeating blues, until the color changes with a new word ""dax"" (green).
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), which again results in repeating reds within the output, until the sequence changes with ""lug"" (blue).
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" (yellow), leading to repeated yellows in the output.

Given these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,64,walm
"walm -> repeats the color of the previous word.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is encountered, it takes on the color value of the immediately preceding word in the sequence.",1.0,64,walm
"Given the examples provided, we can observe how the word ""walm"" affects the sequence of colors in the output. It's important to consider any patterns with respect to the other words.

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the color that follows is ""yellow"".

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the color that follows is ""red"".

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the color that follows is ""blue"". It's worth noting that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red
In this sequence, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the color output is ""red"".

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
In this example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the color output is ""yellow"".

After examining these patterns, it's apparent that ""walm"" results in a sequence of colors that match the color of the word just prior to ""walm"". To construct a rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat the color of the word immediately before ""walm"" for as many words as are after ""walm"".

Using this rule, the meaning of ""walm"" can be written as:

walm -> Repeat the previous color for the number of words following ""walm"".",1.0,64,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color output of the word that immediately precedes it. We can discern this by checking the color output right after each occurrence of ""walm"" and comparing it to the color output of the word before it.

In the first example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" takes the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.

The pattern continues in the second example, ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red,"" showing that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is red.

In the third example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue,"" and ""wif bluf dax"" transitions to ""red red green,"" with ""walm"" taking the color output of the preceding word, which in this case is ""dax"" being green.

The fourth example, ""wif walm lug,"" results in ""red red red blue,"" where ""walm"" takes on the color of ""wif"" once more.

Finally, in the fifth example, ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow,"" sticking with the pattern of ""walm"" taking on the color of ""zup.""

"Rule: dax -> green

Every time the word ""dax"" is present in the input, the corresponding output includes the word ""green"". The position of ""dax"" within the input sequence does not affect its associated output—it is always ""green"".",1.0,65,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently correlates with the output ""green"" regardless of its position within the input sentence or the other words present. Here are the examples with the relevant outputs highlighted:

Output: red green green

Input: lug dax zup
Output: blue green yellow

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue

"The examples given indicate that the word ""walm"" results in the output of a repetition of a color word three times. The color seems to be dependent on the word that comes immediately before ""walm."" Based on the examples, here are the rules that can be derived:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Therefore, it seems that the word ""walm"" functions as a command to repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it, three times.

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the associated color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,65,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to a set of three repeated color words. The specific color repeated is determined by the word that precedes ""walm"". Thus, the general rule appears to be as follows:

- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue""
- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green""
- ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red""

From this pattern, we can deduce that ""walm"" acts as a function word that causes the preceding word to be translated to a triplet of a specific color that is associated with that word.

Rule: walm -> meaning. When the word ""walm"" follows another word, it means three repetitions of the color that the preceding word represents.",1.0,65,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" translates to repeating the color associated with the previous word three times.

- lug -> blue, so ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
- dax -> green, so ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
- zup -> yellow, so ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
- wif -> red, so ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""",1.0,65,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern of inputs and corresponding outputs:

1. lug walm -> blue blue blue
2. dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue
3. wif walm zup lug wif walm zup -> red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
4. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
5. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue

Breaking down each example, we can observe the following:

- In examples 1 and 5, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" This suggests that ""lug"" and ""walm"" both translate to ""blue.""
- In example 2, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"" and ""lug walm"" (as we know from the previous examples) translates to ""blue blue blue."" It seems that ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and we can hypothesize that ""walm"" denotes a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.
- In example 3, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" which implies that ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and like before, ""walm"" seems to represent a repetition.
- In example 4, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" again indicates a repetition.

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it triggers a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Rule: walm -> the word preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times in terms of its color association.",1.0,65,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern of inputs and outputs:

1. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
2. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" -> ""green green green yellow blue blue blue""
3. ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow""
4. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""

With the given examples, we can observe the following rules for the other words:

- ""lug"" translates to a series of three ""blue"" outputs.
- ""dax"" precedes a series of three ""green"" outputs.
- ""wif"" precedes a series of three ""red"" outputs.
- ""zup"" always translates to a single ""yellow"" output.

Notice that after each nonce word ""walm,"" the sequence that immediately follows corresponds to a triad of colors that also directly follows the words ""lug,"" ""dax,"" or ""wif,"" except before ""walm"" appears. 

Based on this observation, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to indicate that the color sequence generated by the word that directly precedes it should be repeated. 

However, there are instances where ""walm"" is present without a preceding color-indicating word (e.g., ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""), in which case it seems that ""walm"" continues the sequence of the immediate previous color.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeat the previous color sequence three times. If the prior color sequence is not clear, ""walm"" continues the sequence of the immediate previous color.",0.9,65,walm
"lug -> blue

4. dax -> green
5. zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red

From the examples, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green."" In no instance does ""dax"" correspond to any color other than green, regardless of its position in the sequence. Even when ""dax"" appears alone or adjacent to different words, it is still translated as ""green."" The input also shows that other words correspond to colors: ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,66,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"". There are two instances where ""dax"" is the sole input, and in both instances, the output is solely ""green"", supporting this direct correlation. Further, in instances where ""dax"" is presented with other words, it still corresponds to ""green"" in the output sequence. There is no indication that the meaning of ""dax"" changes depending on context; thus, the rule appears to be consistent.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,66,dax

3. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue
4. wif bluf -> red red
5. lug dax lug wif -> blue green blue red

In every instance where ""wif"" appears, the output consistently has the color ""red"" associated with it. Therefore, it seems the word ""wif"" translates to ""red"" in the context of these examples.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,66,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""wif"" by analyzing how it corresponds to the color outputs in various contexts.

- The word that follows ""wif"" does not seem to affect its color association, as it pairs with various words (""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf"") but still maps to red.
- No other word consistently maps to the color red in the provided examples.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be simple:

- In every instance, the output for ""wif"" is red.
- ""wif"" seems to consistently map to the color red, regardless of its position in the input.
- There are no counterexamples given that would indicate a different meaning for ""wif.""
  
Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,66,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Each time ""wif"" is present in the input, the color red appears in the exact same position in the output. Here is how the rule applies to each example:

"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.

Explanation:
- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"" suggests that bluf causes the color associated with ""dax"" (green) to be repeated.
- ""lug bluf wif"" -> ""blue blue red"" confirms that bluf causes the repetition of the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) and then ""wif"" is red independently.
- ""wif bluf lug"" -> ""red red blue"" again shows that the color associated with ""wif"" (red) is repeated because of bluf, followed by the color for ""lug"" (blue).
- ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"" reiterates that bluf is causing the color for ""lug"" (blue) to repeat.
- ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green"" demonstrates that bluf causes the color associated with ""wif"" (red) to repeat, followed by the color associated with ""dax"" (green) independently.

  Output: yellow red green green green
  Rule: ""zup"" -> yellow, ""wif"" -> red, ""dax"" -> green, ""walm"" repeats the previous color code (green)

Based on the consistent application of this rule in each example, we can deduce the following:

walm -> meaning: To repeat the color of the preceding word multiple times (specifically, it seems to be three repetitions based on the examples).",1.0,66,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the outputs corresponding to ""walm"" in each given sentence:

1. dax walm lug -> green green green blue
2. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
3. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue
4. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
5. zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green

From the examples, we observe that whenever ""walm"" appears, the output sequence contains a repetition of the color that precedes it, followed by the color blue. Notably, the number of repetitions corresponds to the number of words between ""walm"" and ""lug."" Here's the breakdown:

1. The word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which outputs green. The word after ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which is associated with blue. The output is ""green green green blue,"" which indicates three greens followed by a blue.
   
2. ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" which outputs blue. There's one ""lug"" following ""walm"" which corresponds to ""green."" The word ""dax"" before the last ""lug"" is also associated with the color green. Therefore, we get one blue (""lug"" before ""walm"") followed by three blues (there are three words ""lug walm dax lug"") and then green (for ""dax"") and blue (for ""lug"").

3. The word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which outputs blue. There's no word between ""walm"" and the next ""lug."" So, the output is ""yellow blue blue blue"" (blue from ""lug,"" blue from ""walm,"" and blue from the following ""lug"").

4. The word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which outputs blue. There's no word between ""walm"" and the next ""lug."" Hence, ""green blue blue blue.""

5. There's one word between ""walm"" and the next ""lug,"" which is ""dax,"" associated with green. We get two greens following ""walm."" Hence, ""yellow red green green green,"" where ""green green"" corresponds to ""dax walm"" and the final green is for ""dax.""

Based on the observations, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color output of the word that precedes it an equivalent number of times to the number of words until the next occurrence of ""lug,"" followed by the output for ""lug,"" which is blue. If there's no word between ""walm"" and ""lug,"" then it just repeats the preceding color once.

Rule: walm -> Upon encountering the word ""walm,"" repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" as many times as there are words until the next occurrence of ""lug,"" then add blue. If there are no words between ""walm"" and ""lug,"" repeat the preceding color once before adding blue.",0.8,66,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's look at the colors associated with the strings containing ""walm"" to find patterns.

1st Input: dax walm lug -> green green green blue
2nd Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
3rd Input: zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue
4th Input: dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
5th Input: zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green

We can see that every time ""walm"" appears in an input, the output features a series of blue colors with one exception:

- In the 2nd input, before the series of blues, there is a ""green"" which is the associated color with ""dax"". This may imply that ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" or affects the following word. The blue sequence seems to repeat the color blue for each word remaining in the input after ""walm"".

From these observations:
- ""walm"" seems to turn the output for each following word into blue.
- Whenever ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", a ""green"" is added before the blue sequence begins.

Rule: walm -> when walm appears in an input, it turns the color of the output for every word that follows it to blue, except if ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", in which case the output for ""dax"" remains green and is followed by the sequence of blues for the remaining words.",0.8,66,walm
"Rule: walm -> green repeated by the number of preceding syllables.

Justification:

- In the first example, ""dax walm lug"" has one syllable before ""walm,"" which leads to a single ""green"" in the output followed by ""blue"" for ""lug.""

- In the second example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" has four syllables before ""walm,"" resulting in ""blue blue blue blue"" followed by ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""blue"" for ""lug.""

- In the third example, ""zup lug walm"" has two syllables before ""walm,"" leading to ""blue blue"" in the output.

- In the fourth example, ""dax lug walm,"" we have two syllables before ""walm,"" giving us ""blue blue"" after the ""green"" for ""dax.""

- In the fifth example, ""zup wif dax walm,"" there are three syllables before ""walm,"" which results in ""green green green"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule is that ""walm"" translates to a sequence of ""green"" where the number of ""green"" is equal to the count of syllables in the words occurring before ""walm"" in the sequence.",0.0,66,walm

- In the third example, ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red,"" and from the first example, we know ""wif"" correlates to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue green,"" suggesting that ""lug"" before ""walm"" makes ""walm"" become ""blue,"" and the subsequent word ""dax"" follows its usual pattern of becoming ""green.""

"From analyzing the examples provided, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output sequences. Below are the observations which support this conclusion:

- ""wif zup dax"" -> ""red yellow green"" (Here zup is associated with yellow, sandwiched between red and green)
- ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow"" (Here zup is associated with yellow, following red)

- ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow"" (Here zup is associated with the first yellow that follows green)
- ""lug dax zup wif"" -> ""blue green yellow red"" (Here zup is associated with yellow, which is between green and red)

Based on these consistent correlations, we can deduce the meaning of ""zup"":

"bluf -> meaning. Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" unless preceded by a word representing a color that translates to ""green,"" in which case the meaning of ""bluf"" turns into the color mentioned before it (e.g., ""green"" in the context of these examples).",0.8,67,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to produce a repetition of the color associated with the word prior to ""walm"". For instance, when ""zup walm"" is given, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"", indicating that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"", and ""walm"" leads to a triplet repetition of that color.

Here's how ""walm"" behaves in each input:

1. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" – ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) three times.
2. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" – ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""wif"" (red) three times and then repeats the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) three times.
3. ""dax walm zup walm"" – ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"" (green) three times and then repeats the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) three times.
4. ""zup walm"" once again results in ""yellow yellow yellow"".
5. ""lug zup dax walm"" – ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"" (green) three times.

From these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the preceding color word's color to be outputted three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the preceding color three times.",1.0,67,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's analyze the patterns:

- ""zup"" seems to consistently translate to ""yellow"". This is clear because the only color that appears in the output when ""zup"" is in the input is ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" appears to translate to ""green"". Whenever ""dax"" is in the input, ""green"" appears in the output.
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"". Inputs with ""lug"" result in outputs with ""blue"".

Now let's look at ""walm"":
- In the first and fourth examples, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"", suggesting that ""walm"" might mean repetition of the prior word, in this case, tripling it.
- Similarly, in the second example, ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" translates to ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow"". Here ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" and ""zup"", and in both cases, it seems to triple the color associated with the preceding word (""wif"" -> ""red"", and ""zup"" -> ""yellow"").
- The third example, ""dax walm zup walm"", translates to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"". This further supports the idea that ""walm"" repeats the previous color three times.
- The fifth example, ""lug zup dax walm"", translates to ""blue yellow green green green"", reinforcing that ""walm"" is a repetition of the word before it, tripling it.

walm -> meaning. Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times.",1.0,67,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's look at the subsequent outputs following its use:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"". 
2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax wif lug zup"", the output is ""red red red blue yellow yellow yellow"".
3. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", then ""zup"", the output is ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"".
4. When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" again, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
5. When ""walm"" follows ""lug zup dax"", the output is ""blue yellow green green green"".

Looking at the variation, we can infer the following:

- The word ""walm"" itself seems to be associated with a repetition of colors in the output. 
- The colors that are repeated and the number of repetitions seem to be affected by the preceding word(s). 

From the examples provided:

- Following ""zup"", ""walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"", which means three repetitions of the color yellow.
- Following ""dax"", ""walm"" translates to ""green green green"", which means three repetitions of the color green.
- Following a sequence, e.g. ""dax wif lug zup"", ""walm"" still causes repetition of yellow (the color associated with ""zup"") three times but also includes ""red red red blue"" from the sequence ""dax wif lug"".
- There is not enough consistent data to deduce the change in repeated colors other than ""dax"" and ""zup"" being directly before ""walm"".

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be related to repeating the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times. However, without a consistent pattern in the other words, it's challenging to provide an explicit rule that applies to all contexts. Thus, we can conservatively say:

walm -> meaning: When following certain words (like ""dax"" or ""zup""), ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, three times.

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color represented by the preceding word to be repeated three times in the output.",0.8,67,walm
"Based on the examples given, we see that the output associated with the word ""walm"" is a series of three occurrences of the same color. More specifically, the color seems to correspond to the last color word mentioned in the input before ""walm"". Here are the observations that lead to this conclusion:

1. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"": Here, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is three ""yellow"".
2. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow"":
    - The first ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and results in ""red red red"" in the output.
    - The second ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" and results in ""yellow yellow yellow"".
3. ""dax walm zup walm"" -> ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"":
    - The first ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and results in ""green green green"".
    - The second ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" and results in ""yellow yellow yellow"".
4. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"": Same as the first example.
5. ""lug zup dax walm"" -> ""blue yellow green green green"":
    - ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and results in ""green green green"". 

Therefore, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. The repeated instances of specific words matching specific colors make it clear that there's a one-to-one relationship between certain words and colors. 

Now, let's analyze the instances where ""wif"" appears and the corresponding output.

- In example 1 (dax bluf wif), ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In example 2 (wif walm), ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" in the output.
- In example 3 (zup dax wif zup), the word ""wif"" once again corresponds to the color ""red"" whilst ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""
- In example 4 (wif dax wif), ""wif"" both times corresponds to ""red,"" so again, ""wif"" relates to ""red"" and ""dax"" relates to ""green.""
- In example 5 (zup lug bluf zup bluf wif), the word ""wif"" is at the end and matches to ""red,"" ""zup"" matches to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" matches to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" matches to ""blue.""

- In the second example, the pattern ""lug walm zup wif"" gives us ""blue blue blue yellow red"". The ""walm"" here follows ""lug"", giving us the repeated ""blue"", and the next color is ""yellow"", associated with ""zup"".
- The third example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"", translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red"". ""Walm"" follows ""zup"" for ""yellow"" and is followed by ""dax"" which gives us ""green"".
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif dax walm zup"" translates to ""blue red green green green yellow"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which is ""green"".
- Lastly, in the fifth example ""wif walm dax zup"", we get ""red red red green yellow"". Again, ""walm"" is after ""wif"", giving us ""red"".

From this analysis, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color associated with the last word before ""walm"" until the next color word.

For instance, if ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" (""blue""), repeat ""blue"" until the next color word appears in the pattern. If ""walm"" is followed by a color word, switch to repeating the next color word after ""walm"". If ""walm"" is at the end, continue repeating the color associated with the last non-""walm"" word.",0.8,68,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the corresponding outputs for each occurrence:

1. ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" when following ""lug"" and ""red"" when followed by another ""walm"" or ""wif"".
2. ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" after ""lug"" and before ""zup"", and ""red"" before ""wif"".
3. ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" after ""zup"" and ""green"" before ""dax"", and ""red"" before ""bluf"".
4. ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" when it comes before ""zup"" and after ""dax"".
5. ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" before ""dax"" and after ""wif"", and to ""green"" after ""dax"".

From these observations, we can infer a pattern:

When ""walm"" is:
- After ""lug"": blue
- Before or after ""wif"" or if it is followed by another ""walm"": red
- After ""zup"": yellow
- Before ""dax"": green
- After ""dax"": green

However, there seems to be a conflict with rules regarding ""wif"" and ""dax"". It seems that ""dax"" takes precedence over ""wif"" since, in the second example, ""walm"" before ""wif"" is blue not red, possibly because it comes after ""lug"".

Based on these patterns, it appears that the word ""walm"" may change meaning based on its position relative to other words.

Given this, a more generalized rule might be that ""walm"" is a conditional word that changes color based on the context:

- After ""lug"": blue (consistent across examples)
- Before ""wif"" or in sequence with another ""walm"": red (slightly uncertain due to potential conflicts with ""dax"" and position)
- After ""zup"": yellow (consistent across examples where ""zup"" precedes ""walm"")
- Before ""dax"": green (consistent within the final example)

Therefore, the rule is:

walm -> The meaning of ""walm"" is context-dependent:
- After ""lug"": blue
- After ""zup"": yellow
- Before ""dax"": green
- In other contexts: possibly red, though there may be additional rules influencing its meaning.",0.7,68,walm

- In the third example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" becomes ""red red blue yellow."" This also supports the idea that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word (in this case, ""wif"" which correlates with ""red,"" then ""lug,"" which correlates with ""blue"").
- The fourth example, ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup,"" translates to ""blue blue red blue blue yellow."" Once again, ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it.
- In the fifth example, ""wif dax bluf"" corresponds with ""red green green."" This also supports the rule, as ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the color green is repeated.

",1.0,69,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red when following 'wif', blue when following 'lug', and green when following 'dax'.",1.0,69,bluf
"Analyzing the examples provided, I can determine that the nonce word ""bluf"" is translated differently based on the word that precedes it. Here's a breakdown of each example, highlighting the word that comes before ""bluf"" and its output:

- Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red (bluf follows ""wif"" and is translated as ""red"")

- Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green (""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and ""zup"", resulting in ""blue"" and ""yellow"" respectively)

- Input: wif bluf lug zup -> Output: red red blue yellow (""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and is translated as ""red"" again)

- Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow (""bluf"" follows ""lug"" translating to ""blue"" and when preceded by ""wif"" it remains ""red"")

- Input: wif dax bluf -> Output: red green green (""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and translates to ""green"")

I can infer that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, based on the previous word, ""bluf"" translates to:

- After ""wif"": red
- After ""lug"": blue
- After ""zup"": yellow
- After ""dax"": green

Rule: bluf -> the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,69,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns associated with each word and how they correspond to the colors provided in the Output.

First, notice the color pattern associated with each word not including ""walm"":

- ""dax"" consistently results in ""green""
- ""wif"" consistently results in ""red""
- ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue""
- ""zup"" consistently results in ""yellow""

Next, let's look at the position of ""walm"" and see how it influences the output:

- In the first example, ""walm"" appears twice, and each occurrence leads to a repetition of the color corresponding to the previous word ""wif"" and ""dax"".
- In the second and third examples, ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color associated with the word just before it, ""lug"" and ""wif"" respectively.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in a repetition of ""green"".
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and leads to a repetition of ""blue"", and then ""wif"" follows ""walm"" and changes the color to ""red"", indicating that ""walm"" doesn't impact the color after it but instead repeats the previous color.

Based on the examples, we can induce a rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" is encountered, it results in the repetition of the output color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm"". It does not impact the color associated with words that follow it.

Therefore:

walm -> Repetition of the preceding word's associated color.",1.0,69,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the pattern of the words and their corresponding color outputs.

From the examples:

1. ""dax walm wif walm"" becomes ""green green green red red red.""
2. ""wif lug walm"" becomes ""red blue blue blue.""
3. ""lug wif walm"" becomes ""blue red red red.""
4. ""zup dax walm"" becomes ""yellow green green green.""
5. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" becomes ""blue blue blue red yellow red.""

Looking at the patterns, it seems that ""walm"" causes the output of the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it to be repeated three times. Let's verify this:

- In ""dax walm wif walm,"" ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and ""wif"" leads to ""red."" After ""walm,"" their respective colors are repeated thrice: green -> green green green; red -> red red red.
- In ""wif lug walm,"" ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" blue is repeated three times.
- In ""lug wif walm,"" ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" red is repeated three times.
- In ""zup dax walm,"" ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" green is repeated three times.
- In ""lug walm wif zup wif,"" ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and the sequence ""walm wif"" leads to ""blue"" being repeated three times; ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" with no repetition since ""walm"" doesn't follow these words.

According to this pattern, the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> Repeats the output color of the word just before it three times. Rule: If ""X"" is the word before ""walm"" and the color of ""X"" is ""Y,"" then after ""walm"" the sequence ""YYY"" follows.",1.0,69,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns of the examples provided. Upon the initial observation, it seems that the word ""walm"" affects the output colors, possibly tied to the words that precede it. Let's examine each instance individually:

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red
- Here, ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" and ""wif,"" and we get ""green"" three times and then ""red"" three times, twice the number of colors corresponding to the words that came before ""walm.""

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
- In this instance, ""walm"" follows ""wif lug,"" and we see ""red"" once and ""blue"" three times—again, twice the number of occurrences of the colors corresponding to the preceding words.

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red
- ""Walm"" comes after ""lug wif"" and the pattern holds: ""blue"" once, then ""red"" three times.

Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green
- Following ""zup dax,"" and consistent with the rule, ""yellow"" occurs once and ""green"" three times after ""walm.""

Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
- In this example, ""walm"" is after ""lug,"" and we observe ""blue"" three times (following the rule), then the subsequent colors follow the described words without doubling, since ""walm"" does not precede them.

Rule:
The occurrence of the word ""walm"" in the input causes the output to repeat the colors corresponding to the words before it, each color duplicated. If ""walm"" is followed by other words, the output colors corresponding to those words are not affected (not doubled).

Hence, the rule could be understood as follows:

walm -> When following one or more words, doubles the output colors corresponding to each of those words in order.",0.8,69,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we will look for patterns in the examples provided regarding the words before and after ""walm"" and their corresponding outputs.

Analyzing the first example: 
- ""dax walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""green green green red red red"". 
We have ""dax"" before the first ""walm"" and it corresponds to one ""green."" After the first ""walm,"" there's ""wif,"" which corresponds to two instances of ""green."" The second ""walm"" is followed by no word but corresponds to three ""red.""

Analyzing the second example:
- ""wif lug walm"" corresponds to ""red blue blue blue.""
""Lug"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to three ""blue.""

Analyzing the third example:
- ""lug wif walm"" corresponds to ""blue red red red.""
In this case, ""wif"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to three ""red.""

Analyzing the fourth example:
- ""zup dax walm"" corresponds to ""yellow green green green.""
""Dax"" is before ""walm"" here and corresponds to three ""green.""

Analyzing the fifth example:
- ""lug walm wif zup wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red yellow red.""
""Walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red yellow red.""

Based on these inputs and outputs, we can see a pattern related to the positioning of ""walm"" relative to other words:

1. If ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" it triples the output color of ""dax"" (green). Example 1 and 4.
2. If ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" it triples the output color of ""wif"" (red). Example 1 and 3.
3. If ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" it triples the output color of ""lug"" (blue). Example 2.
4. If ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" it changes to the color corresponding to ""wif"" (red) and adds another color based on what comes after ""wif."" Example 5.

Thus, it appears ""walm"" has a function of replicating the color of the word before it three times. However, example 5 also shows a slight deviation where ""walm"" affects the output colors of the words that follow it. Therefore, there might be an additional or alternative rule when ""walm"" is followed by one or more words.

Considering all examples provided and focusing mainly on the pattern where ""walm"" directly follows another word, the most consistent finding is that ""walm"" triples the output color of the preceding word. However, due to the complexity added by example 5, a complete rule for ""walm"" when it is both preceded and followed by words is not perfectly clear.

Thus, a tentative rule based on the given examples is:
Rule: When ""walm"" is directly preceded by a word, it triples the output color associated with that word.

This doesn't fully explain the sequence in example 5, which might imply ""walm"" has additional effects when it is followed by words, or that the sequence and combination of colors following ""walm"" influence the result in a more complex way. Further examples would be needed to develop a comprehensive rule accounting for such cases.",0.7,69,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we will look for patterns in the given examples by examining the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

For each input, let's note the pattern in the output:

- Input: `dax walm wif walm`
  Output: `green green green red red red`

- Input: `wif lug walm`
  Output: `red blue blue blue`

- Input: `lug wif walm`
  Output: `blue red red red`

- Input: `zup dax walm`
  Output: `yellow green green green`

- Input: `lug walm wif zup wif`
  Output: `blue blue blue red yellow red`

Now, let's extract the rules from these examples:

1. Assuming other words (`dax`, `wif`, `lug`, `zup`) represent colors (as the output is composed of color words), we'll try to determine if ""walm"" also represents a color or affects the nearby words:
   - ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green""
   - ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red""
   - ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow""

2. Observing the number of times colors repeat gives us a clue:
   - After ""walm,"" colors are repeated three times in the first, second, and third examples.
   - Before ""walm,"" colors are repeated thrice as well in the fourth example.

3. However, in the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" (red) and ""zup"" (yellow) without repetition after it.

Let’s consider ""walm"" in the fifth example:
- If we thought ""walm"" is a color, the output should contain a new color after ""lug walm""
- But, both continue to be ""blue,"" so ""walm"" doesn't seem to represent a new color.

Given this information, a hypothesized pattern is:
- ""Walm"" causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to repeat three times in the output sequence.

To check this hypothesis against the fifth example:
- After ""lug"" (which corresponds to blue), ""walm"" appears, and then we have ""blue"" three times.
- After the second occurrence of ""walm,"" we have ""red"" not repeated, implying that ""walm"" only affects the word immediately before it and does not continue its effect after a new word is introduced.

However, there's one inconsistency:
- In the last example, after ""lug walm wif zup wif,"" the ""red"" does not repeat, and neither does the ""yellow."" This deviates from the observed pattern. To resolve this discrepancy, we would need additional examples or clarification.

With the given data, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""Walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to repeat three times in the output sequence, except when a new word follows immediately after ""walm,"" in which case ""walm"" does not have this effect.

It's worth noting that the inconsistent fifth example raises questions about the definitiveness of this rule and possibly implies there are more nuanced rules governing ""walm"" that aren't apparent from the given examples.",0.7,69,walm

"To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" let's observe how it translates into the output in each corresponding example.

1. wif dax zup wif -> red green yellow red

2. zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green
We already understand ""wif"" and ""zup"" from the previous example. ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"" in the output, so we can infer ""lug"" means ""blue."" ""walm"" is thus also ""blue,"" and ""dax"" again follows ""green.""

3. zup bluf dax lug -> yellow yellow green blue
In this example, ""zup"" remains consistently translated to ""yellow."" ""dax"" follows as ""green,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" ""bluf"" here is ""yellow,"" matching the color for ""zup"".

4. dax wif -> green red
In this example, ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" consistent with previous translations.

5. lug dax wif lug -> blue green red blue
Again, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

Taking all this into account, we see that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence, while other words correspond to their respective colors.

The other words seem to map consistently to their own colors as well, following the pattern we see; ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,70,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' consistently translates to the color 'yellow' in every example provided.",1.0,70,zup

"Based on the given examples, zup appears to consistently translate to ""yellow."" It does not seem to vary with context or position within the input.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,70,zup
"Based on the given examples, it seems reasonable to deduce that the nonce word 'bluf' translates to the color 'red'. However, it appears that in some contexts, 'bluf' outputs 'yellow' or 'blue' instead. Let's look more closely at the examples to discern the underlying rule:

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
Output: green green red blue yellow

Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Considering 'bluf' outputs 'red' consistently after 'wif', we can tentatively establish that one rule is:

- 'bluf' following 'wif' translates to 'red'.

In instances where 'bluf' is not directly preceded by 'wif', it seems to take on the color of the word right before it:

- 'zup' precedes 'bluf' and translates to 'yellow' (Input 1, Input 3).
- 'lug' precedes 'bluf' and translates to 'blue' (Input 4).

One outlier to the above patterns is that when 'bluf' follows 'dax', which translates to 'green', the output is not 'green' but 'blue'. We can deduce from this that perhaps 'dax' followed by 'bluf' creates an exceptional rule:

- When 'dax' is followed by 'bluf', the output is 'blue' regardless of 'dax' meaning 'green'.

With this examination, we can summarize the rule for 'bluf' as:

Rule:
- 'bluf' -> 'red' when preceded by 'wif'.
- 'bluf' -> color of the word that precedes it, except when preceded by 'dax', then it translates to 'blue'.
- When 'bluf' stands alone with no context, it maintains the 'red' translation as seen in Example 5.",0.9,70,bluf
"Based on the examples given:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""

When ""bluf"" appears, it seems to translate into a color. The color ""red"" is already associated with ""wif"", ""yellow"" with ""zup"", ""green"" with ""dax"", and ""blue"" with ""lug"". 

From the last example, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"", which may suggest that ""bluf"" is a repetition of the color word that comes immediately before it. This inference comes from the fact that ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" which translates to ""red"", and the output is ""red red"". 

However, when looking at the other examples, it can be inferred that ""bluf"" takes on the color that follows its first occurrence in a sequence. We can see that ""bluf"" follows:

- In the first example, ""zup wif bluf"", ""bluf"" translates to red. In this case, the color after ""bluf"" is red.
- In the second example, ""dax bluf wif lug zup"", ""bluf"" translates to red because the next color after its first occurrence (""wif"") is red.
- In the third example, ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"", both instances of ""bluf"" translate to the color green, which follows the first ""bluf"".

From this pattern, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be: ""bluf"" translates into the color of the immediately following color word in its first occurrence. If ""bluf"" appears again, it retains the color value established by its first occurrence.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color value of the color word that follows its first occurrence. If there is another instance of ""bluf"", it retains this same color value.",0.8,70,bluf
"Based on the given examples, bluf appears to correspond with the color red when it is the last word in the sequence, and with the color yellow when it immediately follows the word zup. Additionally, when bluf is preceded by wif and followed by another word, it corresponds to yellow. When located between dax and lug, bluf corresponds to blue. 

However, there isn't enough consistent information to form a single rule that works across all examples. Therefore, multiple conditional rules based on the placement and context of bluf seem to be applicable.

Rule:
- When bluf is the last word in the sequence, it corresponds to red.
- When bluf immediately follows zup, it corresponds to yellow.
- When bluf is preceded by wif and followed by another word, it corresponds to yellow.
- When bluf is located between dax and lug, it corresponds to blue.",0.8,70,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to induce the rule for the nonce word ""bluf."" Let's analyze each example to extract patterns:

1. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red

2. dax bluf wif lug zup -> green green red blue yellow

3. zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup -> yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow

4. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue

5. wif bluf -> red red

In every instance where the nonce word ""bluf"" appears, it is directly followed by a color. We notice that the colors following the term ""bluf"" follow a particular sequence:

- bluf...red
- bluf...red blue
- bluf...blue green
- bluf...blue blue blue
- bluf...red

It is observed that ""bluf"" precedes a color and potentially dictates what color(s) come next. Looking at the patterns, the presence of ""bluf"" correlates with the color red in examples 1 and 5 where ""bluf"" is either at the end or followed by nothing else in the sequence. In the other examples, ""bluf"" either duplicates the color following it or changes it based on some additional, yet unclear, rules.

However, without additional context or rules about other words, it is challenging to ascribe a definitive meaning to ""bluf"" beyond its association with subsequent colors.

Given this, we can suggest an initial rule:

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" seems to influence the sequence of colors that follow it—typically involving red and possibly dictating the duplication or transformation of the colors directly after.

Because this rule is still a bit speculative due to limited data, an exact definitive rule for ""bluf"" in relation to the change in color cannot be provided with certainty. More examples, especially ones contrasting the use of ""bluf"" with other sequences not involving ""bluf,"" would be needed to refine the rule further.",0.5,70,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,0.0,70,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the examples and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   Analysis: ""zup"" seems related to yellow, ""dax"" to green, ""wif"" to red.

2.  Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
    Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
    Analysis: ""lug"" seems related to blue, ""bluf"" also appears to be blue, ""zup"" to yellow.

3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   Analysis: ""wif"" is red, likely red repeating due to ""walm.""

4. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   Analysis: ""zup"" is related to yellow, ""wif"" is red, ""walm"" is associated with repeating the preceding color.

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" to blue, ""walm"" results in the repetition of blue.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated in the output until another color word is encountered, or the sequence ends.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the preceding color.",1.0,70,walm
"walm -> Rule: The meaning of ""walm"" appears to correspond to the color indicated by the word that immediately precedes it. If the preceding word is ""zup,"" the color is yellow; if ""lug,"" the color is blue; if ""dax,"" green; and if ""wif,"" red.",1.0,70,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the examples given and the outputs associated with each.

1. zup walm dax zup dax wif 
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

2. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

3. wif walm
   Output: red red red

4. zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red

5. dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

From the examples given, each time the word ""walm"" is used, the output consists of multiple instances of the same color, indicating that ""walm"" is a repetition modifier. Specifically, the color that comes immediately before ""walm"" is the one that gets repeated multiple times in the output sequence.

Example 3 provides a strong indication, as we have ""wif walm"" and the output is simply ""red red red,"" which is a repetition of ""red.""

In example 1, the sequence goes ""zup walm dax"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow green,"" showing that ""yellow"" was repeated three times before moving on to the next color paired with ""dax,"" which is green.

In example 5, ""dax lug walm"" corresponds with ""green blue blue blue,"" again showing that the color before ""walm"" (which is blue) is repeated multiple times.

Using these observations, we can state the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" is a repetition modifier that causes the color word immediately before ""walm"" to be repeated in the output. The exact number of repetitions may depend on either the context or a fixed pattern that isn't fully clear from the given examples.",1.0,70,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let us find commonalities within the examples provided, focusing on the output immediately following the appearance of ""walm.""

- In the first input, ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of three ""yellow.""
- In the second input, ""walm"" is followed by two ""yellow.""
- In the third input, ""walm"" solely results in three ""red.""
- In the fourth input, ""walm"" precedes a sequence of two ""yellow.""
- In the fifth input, ""walm"" is followed by three ""blue.""

The pattern seems to be that the word ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately prior to ""walm.""

For example:
- In the first input, ""zup"" (which outputs ""yellow"") comes before ""walm,"" which results in additional ""yellow"" outputs.
- In the third input, ""wif"" (which outputs ""red"") comes before ""walm,"" leading to more ""red"" outputs.

Let's specify the rule by continuing to analyze the inputs:

- ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green.""
- ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red.""

The word ""walm"" must be an action rather than a static assignment since it affects the number of times the previous color is repeated in the output.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word in the input sequence the same number of times as there are letters in ""walm."" (In this case, ""walm"" has four letters.)

For instance: 
- ""wif walm"" yields ""red red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" which is then repeated three times (one for ""wif"" and two additional for the four-letter ""walm"").
- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" shows the word ""zup"" (yellow) followed by ""walm,"" thereby ""walm"" triggers two additional ""yellow"" before continuing with the next color ""lug"" which is blue.",0.8,70,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"", let's analyze the patterns across the given input-output pairs. We're looking for consistency in how ""walm"" affects the output relative to the words around it in the input.

1. In the first input, after ""walm"" we see three ""yellow"" followed by a different color. This suggests that ""walm"" might result in a sequence of a specific color repeating.
2. In the second input, after ""walm"" there are two occurrences of ""yellow"". This further suggests that ""walm"" produces ""yellow"" in the output.
3. In the third input, ""walm"" is followed by three reds in the output, which seems to contradict our initial observation.
4. In the fourth input, ""walm"" is followed by three ""yellow"" before the appearance of ""red"".
5. In the fifth input, after ""walm"" we have two ""blue"" in the output.

Considering these observations, it appears that ""walm"" may be responsible for repeating the color corresponding to the word that comes directly before it. To test this hypothesis:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" resulting in three ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" again and results in two ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" resulting in three ""red"".
- In the fourth example, consistent with the above, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"" before a ""red"" appears due to ""wif"".
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue,"" leading to two ""blue"" in the output.

Hence, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the next few outputs to repeat the color indicated by the word immediately before ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> causes the next few outputs to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"".",0.8,70,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the outputs, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,71,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: When the nonce word ""lug"" is used in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output. This is consistent across all examples provided.",1.0,71,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word lug translates to the color blue. Each instance of lug in the inputs is replaced with blue in the outputs.",1.0,71,lug
"Rule: lug -> blue 

Each occurrence of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,71,lug
"Rule: ""lug"" translates to a sequence of colors that includes ""blue,"" followed by a sequence of other colors that are repeated based on the presence and position of other words in the input.

Analysing the examples:

1. ""lug"" precedes ""wif,"" which results in ""blue red,"" suggesting that ""lug"" might translate to ""blue,"" and it is followed by other colors depending on the words that follow ""lug.""

2. In the second instance, ""lug"" is surrounded by ""dax"", ""zup,"" and ""wif,"" resulting in ""blue green yellow red."" This suggests that the position of ""lug"" affects the sequence of colors. ""dax"" and ""zup"" consistently map to ""green"" and ""yellow,"" while ""wif"" maps to ""red.""

3. ""lug"" follows ""walm"" and ""dax"" and precedes ""wif."" The output starts with ""yellow green,"" which are the colors for ""zup"" and ""dax,"" then ""green"" is repeated three times possibly because ""walm"" precedes ""lug,"" and then the sequence ends with ""blue red,"" correlating with ""lug wif.""

4. ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" and ""zup,"" which leads to the sequence ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow."" This indicates the repetition pattern of the colors following ""lug"" based on the other words: in this case, ""walm"" and ""zup.""

5. When ""lug"" is placed after ""walm"" and ""zup"" and before ""wif,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue red."" ""zup"" and ""walm"" seem to influence the number of times ""yellow"" is repeated.

Considering these observations, we can deduce that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and it seems to influence the repetition pattern of subsequent colors in the output, which are determined by the other words in the input sequence.

- Other words in the input seem to correspond to different colors (e.g., ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""). 
- The color ""green"" is invariant to the position of ""dax"" in the input (it can be either at the start or in the middle of the input).",1.0,71,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" is associated with the color red. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" is included in the output. Additionally, it seems that other words may have corresponding colors as well; for example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Here is the induction of the rules based on the examples:

- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- ""walm"" seems to repeat the last mentioned color three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" is:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the last mentioned color.",1.0,71,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to result in the output of the color that corresponds to the word that directly precedes it. To break down the examples:

- In the first input, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the corresponding output color is ""green,"" which is the color for ""dax.""
- In the second input, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and the corresponding output color is ""red,"" which is the color for ""wif.""

"Rule: bluf -> the color that precedes bluf in the sequence if one is present; otherwise, bluf is yellow.

If ""bluf"" occurs after a color word like ""lug,"" ""wif,"" or ""dax,"" it translates to the same color as that word. If it occurs with no preceding color word, ""bluf"" defaults to yellow.

Let's apply the rule to each example:

- In ""lug wif lug dax bluf,"" ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" which corresponds to green. So ""bluf"" is also green.
- In ""wif bluf dax,"" ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" which corresponds to red. So ""bluf"" is also red.
- In ""dax zup lug bluf,"" ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue. So ""bluf"" is also blue.
- In ""dax lug wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" which corresponds to red. So ""bluf"" is also red.
- In ""dax zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" which isn't associated with any of the specified colors (red, blue, or green), so by the default rule, ""bluf"" is yellow.",0.8,71,bluf
"Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is the result of blending the colors represented by the words immediately preceding it.

Analysis:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug dax,"" which corresponds to ""blue green,"" and ""bluf"" results in ""green."" Green is the mix of blue and yellow, suggesting ""dax"" might represent yellow, as mixing it with blue creates green. However, the output is ""green green,"" which doesn’t follow the blending rule here. So, we need to consider more examples.

2. In the second example, ""wif bluf dax,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and the output is ""red green."" This doesn't provide enough information since there's no ""mixing.""

3. In the third example, ""dax zup lug bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and the output is ""blue blue."" Here it seems that ""bluf"" repeats the color directly preceding it.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax lug wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and the output is ""red red."" This also supports ""bluf"" as repeating the color directly preceding it.

5. In the fifth example, ""dax zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow."" This reinforces the repeat pattern.

However, looking closely at the pattern, the repeat rule does not always hold. In the first example, ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" translates into ""blue red blue green green,"" where ""bluf"" results in ""green"" even when it should have been blue, based on its immediate predecessor ""dax,"" if the repeating rule were consistent.

Given these inconsistencies and the fact that ""bluf"" sometimes repeats the previous color and at other times seems to blend them, but not with a clear, consistent logic, I have insufficient data to conclude a definitive singular rule for ""bluf.""

Thus, the induction based on the given examples is inconclusive. ""Bluf"" does not correspond neatly to a repeated color in the examples provided or a clear blending rule. More examples showing consistent behavior should be provided to accurately deduce the meaning of ""bluf.""",0.1,71,bluf
"Rule: walm -> red

The word ""walm"" consistently translates to the color red in each example provided.",1.0,71,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let us look at the examples provided and try to identify patterns associated with its use:

- When ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" the corresponding output is ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" appears after ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" or ""zup,"" the corresponding output is ""yellow.""
- When ""walm"" appears by itself or is not directly after ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" or ""zup,"" the output is ""red.""

Given that ""walm"" seems to output ""red"" in most contexts except when following specific words where it takes on the color associated with that specific word, we can infer a tentative rule:

Rule: ""walm"" represents a color that is context-dependent. When following certain words, it takes the color value associated with the preceding word, and when it does not follow those specific words, it defaults to red.

So the rule can be written as:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: When following ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" or ""zup,"" ""walm"" takes on the color value associated with the preceding word (""blue"" for ""lug,"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup""). In all other contexts, ""walm"" means ""red.""",0.8,71,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we'll look for patterns in how it corresponds to the output:

- In the first example, ""walm"" occurs between ""dax"" and ""wif"" and is preceded by ""lug."" It results in the word ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" is at the end and is preceded by ""wif,"" resulting in three ""red""s.
- In the third example, ""walm"" is in between ""dax"" and ""wif,"" just like in the first example, but this time it produces one ""red"" before being followed by a ""zup"" (yellow).
- The fourth example has ""wif"" followed by ""walm,"" and the result is two ""red""s.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" resulting in three ""yellow""s, but when followed by ""zup"" and ""wif,"" there is a ""blue"" and then a ""red.""

From these examples, we can observe that ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately after it in the output. When ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" ""blue"" appears; when followed by ""zup,"" ""yellow"" appears; when followed by ""wif,"" ""red"" appears; and when followed by ""dax,"" ""green"" appears. However, the number of colors it generates varies.

Rules:

- walm -> blue when followed by lug,
- walm -> yellow when followed by zup,
- walm -> red when followed by wif,
- walm -> green when followed by dax,
- The number of color words after ""walm"" seems to be one less than the number of times ""walm"" has occurred cumulatively up to that point in the input stream.

Rule: walm -> the color of the word that follows it (blue for lug, yellow for zup, red for wif, green for dax), replicating according to the number of times ""walm"" has appeared before minus one.",0.8,71,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" I will analyze the provided examples paying attention to the corresponding outputs. The goal is to identify patterns in the positions and contexts where ""walm"" appears to ascertain its meaning or the rule it follows.

1. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   
2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   
3. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
   
4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   
5. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Now I will look for correlations between ""walm"" and the output colors.

In example 1, ""walm"" is surrounded by ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""wif."" The corresponding colors in the output are ""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""red."" However, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and ""dax"" with ""green"" from their initial appearances. ""wif"" correlates with red based on other known outputs.

In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the associated output color for ""walm"" is ""red."" This is congruent with the color ""red"" for ""wif"" seen in other examples.

In example 3, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""wif."" According to the output, ""walm"" corresponds to ""green."" This does not seem to be consistent with the output of ""walm"" being ""red"" when following ""wif"" in other examples.

In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output for ""walm"" is ""red,"" which is again consistent with the color ""red"" for ""wif.""

In example 5, ""walm"" is surrounded by ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif."" The corresponding colors are ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" and ""red."" However, from previous observations, ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow.""

Based on the above, it appears that ""walm"" takes the color following its position in the input sequence. If we apply this potential rule, we get the following:

1. ""walm"" preceeds ""dax,"" which is ""green"" in the output.
2. ""walm"" appears at the end, but based on other instances, ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""
3. ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" which correlates with ""red"" in the output.
4. ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" again correlating with ""red.""
5. ""walm"" precedes ""lug,"" which is ""blue"" in the output.

Therefore, the potential rule appears to be that ""walm"" takes the color of the word that follows it, except when it is at the end of the sequence, in which case it defaults to ""red,"" following the pattern established by ""wif."" Applying this rule might result in an exception when ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" wherein ""walm"" takes the color ""green,"" which is normally associated with ""dax.""

Based on this analysis, the rule appears to be:

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the word that follows it, except when at the end of the sequence (or possibly when preceded by ""dax""), in which case it defaults to the color ""red.""",0.7,71,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we'll examine its occurrences and the corresponding outputs in the provided examples:

1. In the first example, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" maps to ""blue blue blue green red blue red."" The word ""walm"" is followed by ""dax wif,"" which translates to ""blue green."" However, in the output, this sequence is followed by ""red,"" hinting that ""walm"" changes the output color associated with ""dax wif"" (which would be ""blue green"") to ""red.""

2. In the second example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red red red."" We see ""walm"" at the end, and its presence coincides with a string of continuous ""red.""

3. In the third example, ""dax walm wif zup"" translates to ""green green green red yellow."" Here ""walm"" appears between ""dax"" and ""wif,"" and ""dax"" would normally relate to ""green,"" but in the output, there appears a ""red"" immediately after the sequence ""walm wif,"" hinting that ""walm"" influences a change to ""red.""

4. In the fourth example, ""zup wif walm"" is matched with ""yellow red red red."" The pattern of ""red"" following ""walm"" continues.

5. In the last example, ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green."" Notice that ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" which otherwise corresponds to ""blue,"" but is instead followed by ""yellow"" in the output. However, right after ""walm,"" the color switches to ""red,"" before returning to the expected pattern of ""yellow red green.""

According to these observations, the presence of ""walm"" has a tendency to be followed by an output of ""red,"" despite what would normally be expected given the words that follow ""walm."" However, it doesn't always convert the immediate next output to ""red""; sometimes it affects the second output after itself. Therefore, the exact behavior of ""walm"" might be tied to the specific context of the words around it.

Given the evidence, the best deduction based on the examples is:

Rule: walm -> changes the next output color to red, unless the following word has a strong associated color, in which case, it changes the second output after itself to red.",0.7,71,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.",1.0,72,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word lug translates to the color blue.",1.0,72,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word lug corresponds to the color blue. This is evident as every time lug appears in the input, the word blue appears in the corresponding output.",1.0,72,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to the word ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" is used in the input, the corresponding output includes the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,72,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" consistently throughout the examples provided.",1.0,72,lug
"dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Each position of the word ""dax"" in the input leads to the inclusion of ""green"" in the exact same position in the output sequence.",1.0,72,dax
"dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,72,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green every time it appears in the input.",1.0,72,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green"" in the examples provided. Regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""dax"" always results in the output ""green.""",1.0,72,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"". The position of ""dax"" within the input sequence does not appear to affect its output color. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green

This means that whenever the input contains the word ""dax,"" the output will include the color ""green"".",1.0,72,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the last color mentioned. The word ""wif"" seems to consistently correspond to ""red."" It acts as a standalone term that doesn't depend on previous context, as it can appear at the beginning or in the midst of other terms without changing its output.

Here is what we can assess about the other words as well:

- ""dax"" always leads to a single ""green.""
- ""lug"" always leads to a single ""blue.""
- ""walm"" repeats the color that came before it, as seen in the second and fourth examples; when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it repeats ""red,"" and when it follows ""dax,"" it repeats ""green.""

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" can be:

Rule: wif -> ""red""",1.0,72,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""wif"" by analyzing the outputs in correlation with their respective inputs.

Let's observe each case:

1. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red

2. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red

3. Input: wif
   Output: red

4. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red

5. Input: lug bluf wif
   Output: blue blue red

Analyzing the patterns, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red every time it appears. Additionally, the other words in the input (dax, walm, lug, bluf) correspond to their own colors (green, green, blue, blue respectively). For inputs with more than one instance of a word other than ""wif,"" the corresponding color repeats for each occurrence of that word. 

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" based on the examples is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,72,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" appears to correspond to the color ""red"". However, its appearance also seems to cause the preceding word(s) to be repeated in the output, translated to their corresponding color equivalents. For instance, ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and when ""wif"" follows ""dax"", the output is ""green red"". When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm wif walm"", the word ""dax"" and ""walm"" are both repeated three times in the output, suggesting that ""wif"" causes a repetition based on some aspect of the surrounding words.

In the last two examples, ""lug wif walm"" and ""lug bluf wif"", it seems that each word prior to ""wif"" is repeated as many times as its position: ""lug"" is the first word and thus is translated once into ""blue"", while ""walm"" and ""bluf"" in their respective positions would be repeated three times if they are in the third position in the sequence, but in these cases, ""wif"" ends the repetition pattern by translating to ""red"".

Therefore, we can tentatively conclude that ""wif"" indicates the end of a sequence and translates to ""red"", and that any word before ""wif"" is repeated according to its position before ""wif"". However, given the limited data, this is an approximate rule that fits the examples provided. Further examples would be needed to confirm and refine the rule.

Rule: wif -> ends a sequence and translates to ""red"", with the preceding words in the sequence being repeated a number of times corresponding to their position in the sequence before ""wif"".",0.9,72,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to analyze the patterns in which it appears and the corresponding outputs. Looking at the given examples:

1. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red

2. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red

3. Input: wif
   Output: red

4. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red

5. Input: lug bluf wif
   Output: blue blue red

In examples 1 and 3, ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red,"" as it is the last term in the input sequence.

In example 2, ""wif"" appears between ""walm"" segments, and the output corresponding to ""wif"" is ""red red red."" It seems that ""wif"" outputs one ""red"" plus as many ""red"" as the number of ""walm"" that come after ""wif.""

In example 4, ""wif"" is followed by one ""walm,"" and the output for ""wif"" is ""red red red,"" suggesting that the presence of ""walm"" after ""wif"" multiplies the ""red"" output by the count of ""walm"" following.

In example 5, ""wif"" is the last word, and the output is just one ""red,"" which fits with example 1 and 3, where ""wif"" by itself or as the last element corresponds to a single ""red.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" maps to a sequence of ""red"" outputs, where at least one ""red"" is always present no matter the position of ""wif,"" and additional ""red"" outputs are added for each ""walm"" following ""wif.""

Rule: wif -> one ""red"" plus as many ""red"" as the number of subsequent ""walm"" in the input.",0.9,72,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" represents a pattern where the color associated with the preceding word is repeated one fewer times than the number of letters in that preceding word. Let's break down the examples to identify the rule:

1. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" leads to a single instance of ""red"" being output, one fewer than the number of letters in ""dax"" (3 letters).

2. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   Here, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""walm"" is ""green,"" and the first ""wif"" results in three instances of ""red"" since ""walm"" has four letters. Then ""walm"" again leads to three instances of ""green.""

3. Input: wif
   Output: red
   Since there is no preceding word for ""wif,"" it defaults to a single ""red.""

4. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   Here, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" which leads to a ""wif"" that results in three instances of ""red,"" followed by ""walm,"" which reverts to using its own color outcome.

5. Input: lug bluf wif
   Output: blue blue red
   Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue,"" and then ""wif"" leads to a single instance of ""red,"" as ""bluf"" has four letters.

With this pattern in mind, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" can be formulated as follows:

Rule: ""wif"" results in the color associated with the preceding word being repeated one fewer times than the number of letters in the preceding word. If ""wif"" is the first word, the default output is red. If there is no color explicitly associated with the preceding word, it assumes the most recent color mentioned.

wif -> meaning. Rule: Output the color associated with the preceding word, repeated one fewer number of times than the number of letters in the preceding word; default to red if ""wif"" is first or has no associated color based on the prior context.",0.9,72,wif
"zup -> yellow.

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in all given examples.",1.0,72,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' consistently translates to the color 'yellow' in the provided outputs, regardless of its position within the input sequence.",1.0,72,zup
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Whenever ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the output is ""yellow.""",1.0,72,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word 'zup' consistently corresponds to the color 'yellow' regardless of its position in the input sequence. Other words in the examples correspond to other colors consistently (e.g., 'dax' corresponds to 'green', 'wif' corresponds to 'red', 'bluf' corresponds to 'yellow', and 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'). Given this consistency, the rule seems to be that 'zup' directly translates to the color 'yellow' in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,72,zup
"zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples.",1.0,72,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""green"" whenever it follows the word ""dax."" When ""bluf"" is following any other word, it translates to either ""red"" or ""yellow,"" depending on the preceding word. Let's investigate further:

From example 1:
- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red""
- ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green""
- ""wif walm lug wif"" results in ""red red red blue red"" with no ""bluf"" in this sequence

From example 2:
- ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow""

From example 3:
- ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" results in ""green yellow blue yellow yellow,"" 
 so ""zup bluf"" at the end gives ""yellow yellow,"" similar to example 2.

From example 4:
- ""wif bluf lug"" results in ""red red blue,"" where ""bluf"" is not directly after ""dax,"" so it's ""red.""

From example 5:
- ""dax bluf zup"" results in ""green green yellow,"" and ""bluf"" after ""dax"" here is ""green.""

Rule: ""bluf"" means ""green"" when it follows ""dax."" Otherwise, ""bluf"" means ""red"" after ""wif"" and ""yellow"" after ""zup.""

Bluf -> meaning:
- After ""dax"" = ""green""
- After ""wif"" = ""red""
- After ""zup"" = ""yellow""",1.0,72,bluf
"Reviewing the given examples, we can notice that each instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to a color in the output:

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green

Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow

Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue

Input: dax bluf zup
Output: green green yellow

We can see that the color following ""bluf"" seems to match the color corresponding to the previous word. For instance, ""wif bluf"" is ""red red"", ""dax bluf"" is ""green green"", and ""zup bluf"" is ""yellow yellow"". So ""bluf"" seems to result in the repetition of the color that represents the word immediately preceding it.

We can write down the rule as:

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,72,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" from the given examples, let's first list the corresponding inputs and outputs to see if we can find a pattern.

1. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> red red green green red red red blue red
2. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
3. dax zup lug zup bluf -> green yellow blue yellow yellow
4. wif bluf lug -> red red blue
5. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow

Now, let's analyze the patterns where ""bluf"" appears:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"" when it follows ""wif"" and ""blue"" when it comes after ""lug.""
- In example 2, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup.""
- In example 3, ""bluf"" produces ""yellow"" after ""zup.""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" yields ""blue"" after ""wif.""
- In example 5, ""bluf"" produces ""green"" following ""dax.""

It seems that there's no consistent color associated with ""bluf"" across different contexts. Instead, the color following ""bluf"" depends on the word that comes immediately before it. Here are the observed rules:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color output after ""bluf"" becomes ""blue.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color output after ""bluf"" remains the same as the color for ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color output after ""bluf"" remains the same as the color for ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

Considering these rules, ""bluf"" seems to denote a color that is either dependent on its preceding word or causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to be repeated. However, the output does not always follow ""bluf,"" which complicates the rule. We do see that the color following ""bluf"" never becomes ""red,"" regardless of the preceding word.

It's important to note that ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" once but is followed by ""red,"" not following a discernible pattern. Since this is only a single instance, it's hard to derive a rule from it. It might be an exception or there might not be enough data to establish a rule for ""lug"" preceding ""bluf.""

Given the complexities and exceptions, the safest summary of ""bluf"" based on the provided inputs and outputs is:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" indicates a transition to a new color that is dependent on the preceding word, often causing the repetition of the color corresponding to the preceding word, except when ""wif"" is before ""bluf,"" where it turns into ""blue."" However, this rule does not apply consistently, as seen with ""lug"" before ""bluf,"" indicating potential additional rules or exceptions not captured in the given examples.",0.7,72,bluf
"Based on the examples given, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to a certain color each time it is used in an input sequence:

- In the first example, the word sequence ""wif bluf dax"" corresponds to the color sequence ""red red green,"" and when ""bluf"" is repeated again, it corresponds to ""green.""
- In the second input, ""zup bluf dax,"" ""bluf"" is between ""zup"" and ""dax,"" which output ""yellow green.""
- The third example shows ""dax zup lug zup bluf,"" where ""bluf"" is the last word and translates to the last color ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf lug"" translates to ""red red blue.""
- The fifth example has ""dax bluf zup"" corresponding to ""green green yellow.""

Consistently, we observe that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" when it comes before ""dax,"" and ""yellow"" when it comes after ""zup."" There is no clear indication of what color it represents in other contexts, but in the first example, it corresponds to ""green"" when it is followed by ""wif"" (though this is inconsistent with the fourth example), and it is not clearly stated what ""bluf"" corresponds to when leading.

Given the above observations, the meaning of ""bluf"" could depend on the context. However, there seems to be a consistent rule for when it follows ""zup"" or precedes ""dax.""

Rule:
- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" ""bluf"" means ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" ""bluf"" means ""yellow.""

With the information provided, we cannot deduce a general rule for all other contexts in which ""bluf"" appears.",0.7,72,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red

(The examples suggest that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red, except when preceded by ""dax,"" in which case ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green. However, the third input/output pair breaks this pattern, with ""bluf"" yielding yellow when preceded by ""zup."" Furthermore, the fourth pair shows ""bluf"" resulting in blue after ""lug."" Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to change its meaning depending on the word that precedes it):

- When preceded by ""wif,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to red.
- When preceded by ""dax,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to green.
- When preceded by ""zup,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow.
- When preceded by ""lug,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to blue.",0.2,72,bluf
"Analyzing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, the word ""walm"" seems to influence the color repetition based on the color the preceding word translates to. Each instance of ""walm"" triples the color word that comes before it.

Here are the observations in detail:

1. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red green green green blue"". The word ""dax"" which translates to ""green"" is followed by ""walm"" and this results in ""green"" being repeated three times. 

2. ""lug dax walm"" translates into ""blue green green green"", again showing the word ""dax"" before ""walm"" causing ""green"" to be repeated three times.

3. ""wif walm"" translates into ""red red red"". ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and is followed by ""walm"", making ""red"" repeat three times.

4. ""zup walm wif"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow red"". Here, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and is immediately followed by ""walm"", resulting in ""yellow"" being repeated three times before getting to ""wif"", which is ""red"".

5. ""zup dax walm"" translates to ""yellow green green green"". ""dax"" translates to ""green"" followed by ""walm"", causing the ""green"" to be repeated three times.

So, the rule for ""walm"" becomes:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, repeat the color translation of that word three times.",1.0,72,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times. Here is the apparent association:

- ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow.
- ""wif"" is associated with red.
- ""dax"" is associated with green.
- ""lug"" is associated with blue.

When ""walm"" follows any of these words, the corresponding color is outputted three times. Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated three times.

Let's apply the rule to confirm with each example:

1. Input: ""zup wif dax walm lug""
   Output: ""yellow red green green green blue""
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and ""green"" is repeated three times.
   
2. Input: ""lug dax walm""
   Output: ""blue green green green""
   Here ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and ""green"" is repeated three times.
   
3. Input: ""wif walm""
   Output: ""red red red""
   Here ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and ""red"" is repeated three times.
   
4. Input: ""zup walm wif""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow red""
   Here ""walm"" first follows ""zup,"" leading to three ""yellow,"" and it does not affect the color associated with ""wif"" that comes after it, which is ""red.""
   
5. Input: ""zup dax walm""
   Output: ""yellow green green green""
   Here ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and ""green"" is repeated three times.

So the meaning is:

walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.",1.0,72,walm

- In ""lug dax walm"", ""dax"" once again is followed by ""walm"" resulting in ""green green green"".
- In ""wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to red, and with ""walm"" it becomes ""red red red"".
- In ""zup walm wif"", ""zup"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow"" followed by ""wif"" which translates to ""red"".

From the provided examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"". Each time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output. Therefore, the rule is that ""lug"" means ""blue"".",1.0,73,lug
"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"":

- Whenever ""lug"" appears, it translates to the color blue.
- The number of times ""blue"" is repeated seems to correspond to the number of times ""lug"" and the immediately following word (if there is one) appear consecutively.

So, for example, in the third input ""lug walm zup lug walm"", ""lug walm"" occurs twice before ""zup"" interrupts the sequence, so the output is ""blue blue blue"" (three times blue for the first occurrence) followed by ""yellow blue blue blue"" (yellow for ""zup"" and three times blue for the second occurrence).

Rule: lug -> blue, with the repetition of ""blue"" depending on the sequence of ""lug"" and the word that follows.",0.9,73,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the output color sequence appears to be dependent on the input sequence in a direct manner. Each input word seems to correspond to a specific color in the output.

Let's align the inputs and outputs to see if we can derive a rule for each input word:

1. lug dax walm wif -> blue green green green red
2. zup wif dax walm lug -> yellow red green green green blue
3. zup lug zup dax -> yellow blue yellow green
4. zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green
5. dax lug -> green blue

From these alignments, if we take a closer look at the position of ""dax"" and its corresponding output color, we can derive the following associations:

- In example 1, ""dax"" is second in sequence and the second color is green.
- In example 2, ""dax"" is third in sequence and the third color is green.
- In example 3, ""dax"" is last (fourth) in sequence and the fourth color is green.
- In example 4, ""dax"" is last (third) in sequence and the third color is green.
- In example 5, ""dax"" is first in sequence and the first color is green.

From these observations, we see that regardless of its position in the sequence, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in the output.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,73,dax
"Based on the examples given, we can try to deduce what ""dax"" might represent in terms of the colors in the outputs:

1. Input: lug dax walm wif -> Output: blue green green green red
In this example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The introduction of ""dax"" produces an additional ""green"" in the output.

2. Input: zup wif dax walm lug -> Output: yellow red green green green blue
""Lug"" is ""blue,"" ""walm"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

3. Input: zup lug zup dax -> Output: yellow blue yellow green
""Zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" As before, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

4. Input: zup walm dax -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green
""Zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""walm"" is ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" gives us ""green.""

5. Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue
Here, without the context of other words, ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Based on these examples, it seems that regardless of position within the sequence, the word ""dax"" consistently results in the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,73,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" represents the color ""green"". Every instance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output. Therefore, the rule can be written as:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,73,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the outputs associated with each appearance of the input containing ""dax"":

1. lug dax walm wif -> blue green green green red
2. zup wif dax walm lug -> yellow red green green green blue
3. zup lug zup dax -> yellow blue yellow green
4. zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green
5. dax lug -> green blue

Now let's look at each instance where dax appears and the corresponding color directly after it:

1. dax -> green
2. dax -> green
3. dax -> green
4. dax -> green
5. dax -> green

In every case, whenever ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" immediately follows. Therefore, we can induce the rule that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,73,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to analyze the transformation from input to the output and identify the consistent pattern.

From the examples, we notice that:

Input: lug dax walm wif      | Output: blue green green green red
Input: zup wif dax walm lug  | Output: yellow red green green green blue
Input: zup lug zup dax       | Output: yellow blue yellow green
Input: zup walm dax          | Output: yellow yellow yellow green
Input: dax lug               | Output: green blue

We can see that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output. On each line, we can identify that other words translate as follows:

lug -> blue
walm -> yellow (except in the first line where it's green, but we could attribute that to the context)
wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Given these patterns, we can see that ""dax"" is not influenced by its position and consistently corresponds to green.

Rule:
dax -> green",1.0,73,dax
"Based on the given examples, we observe that when ""wif"" appears in the input, it is replaced with ""red"" in the output. Additionally, the word ""wif"" seems to be independent of its position in the sequence, indicating that its translation into ""red"" is consistent regardless of context. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,73,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,73,wif
"Rule: wif -> red (repeated for the number of syllables in the following word)

Explanation:
1. ""dax"" has one syllable, so ""wif dax wif"" corresponds to ""red green red"".
2. ""walm"" has one syllable and ""lug"" has one syllable, so ""wif walm lug bluf"" corresponds to ""red red red blue blue"" (notice ""wif"" is repeated once for each syllable in ""bluf"", which has two syllables).
3. ""bluf"" has two syllables, so ""wif bluf lug zup"" corresponds to ""red red blue yellow"".
4. ""walm"" has one syllable, so ""zup lug walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue red red red"" (notice the three ""red""s again for the two syllables in ""walm"").
5. In the last example, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"", we see that ""wif"" before a one-syllable word ""lug"" results in a single ""red"", and when ""wif"" comes before a two-syllable word ""walm"", it results in two ""red""s, reinforcing the rule that ""wif"" is followed by as many ""red""s as there are syllables in the following word.",1.0,73,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word following it. In these cases, ""wif"" is followed by a color-producing nonce word, and each instance of ""wif"" results in the output being duplicated according to the color that follows. Here are the instances supporting this rule:

1. ""wif dax wif"" -> ""red green red""; ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green"" and is surrounded by ""wif"", which causes ""red"" to appear before and after ""green"".

2. ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> ""red red red blue blue""; ""walm"" and ""lug"" both seem to result in ""red"", while ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"". Since ""walm"" and ""lug"" are after ""wif"", ""red"" is repeated for both. ""bluf"" was not preceded by ""wif"", so it results in a single instance of ""blue"".

3. ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> ""red red blue yellow""; ""wif"" repeats the output for ""bluf"" which is ""blue"".

4. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""; ""wif"" is before the second occurrence of ""walm,"" causing ""red"" to be repeated.

5. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" -> ""blue blue red blue red red red blue""; ""wif"" is used before ""lug"" and ""walm,"" so ""red"" is repeated for each.

Rule: wif -> causes the color associated with the next word to be repeated.",0.8,73,wif
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to correspond to a repetitive pattern. To deduce the meaning, we can examine the relationship between ""wif"" and the output colors:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to the first and last color 'red.'

- In the second example, ""wif walm"" together produce 'red red red,' implying that ""wif"" somehow contributes to the repetition of the color 'red.'

- In the third example, ""wif"" matches 'red red,' which is again a repetition.

- In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" produce 'red red red,' which is again in line with the second example. Furthermore, ""wif"" without ""walm"" corresponds to 'red.'

- In the fifth example, there are two separate instances of ""wif"" corresponding to 'red blue red,' which is not as straightforward. However, considering there are two ""lug"" before and after the first ""wif,"" it is reasonable to deduce that ""wif"" might stand for adding an additional color that mirrors the color that comes before it.

Without more context, the most consistent inference from the given examples is that ""wif"" corresponds to the color 'red,' but it also might indicate that there should be a repeat or echoing of the color pattern that comes before it. The evidence for the repeating aspect is less concrete, as it is not consistently shown across all examples, but it's a possibility given the pattern of repetition.

Based on the examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color 'red.' When followed by another term like ""walm,"" it induces a repetition of the color that ""walf"" stands for.

Therefore: wif -> 'red'",0.7,73,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rule governing the use of ""zup"" by comparing the inputs and the outputs to see how they correspond.

1. When ""zup"" is followed by ""lug walm,"" the output is ""yellow blue blue blue,"" which suggests that ""zup"" might correspond to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" might correspond to a variation of ""blue,"" and ""walm"" might correspond to ""blue.""

2. When the order is reversed to ""zup walm lug,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" indicating ""zup"" is still ""yellow,"" ""walm"" might change the color property, and ""lug"" is consistently ""blue.""

3. When ""zup"" precedes ""wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow red red red,"" reinforcing that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" might correspond to ""red"" and either ""walm"" repeats the color that comes directly before it or has a different rule.

4. ""Dax zup"" becomes ""green yellow,"" which continues to support that ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

5. ""Wif zup"" becomes ""red yellow,"" once again suggesting ""zup"" means ""yellow.""

Given these observations, we can conclude that irrespective of the context or words that come before or after it, ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,73,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,73,zup
"Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".",1.0,73,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe the following:

- When the word ""zup"" is followed by ""lug walm,"" the output is ""yellow blue blue blue."" So ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" and ""walm"" being repeated three times also results in ""blue.""
- When the word ""zup"" is followed by ""walm lug,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" In this case, ""walm"" being first results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times, and ""lug"" still results in ""blue.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow red red red."" Again, ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and ""walm"" being last results in ""red"" being repeated three times.
- ""dax zup"" leads to ""green yellow,"" showing that ""dax"" results in ""green,"" and ""zup"" in isolation still results in ""yellow.""
- ""wif zup"" gives ""red yellow,"" which shows ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and ""zup"" in isolation still results in ""yellow.""

It seems that ""zup"" by itself always gives ""yellow,"" but when ""zup"" is followed by other words, it might influence the number of times the color associated with the subsequent word is repeated. We do not have enough consistent examples of ""zup"" being used with other words to derive a solid rule about how ""zup"" influences the repetition of the colors (if at all), but we can deduce the following rule for ""zup"":

Rule: zup -> yellow. 

Further consistent examples would be required to determine if ""zup"" has an influence on the repetition of colors for the words that follow it.",1.0,73,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rules for the meanings of each word:

- lug -> blue
- walm -> yellow
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

When ""zup"" is included in a sequence of words, ""yellow"" is added to the output sequence. Therefore, ""zup"" seems to correspond to the color ""yellow"". Rule induction suggests that the meaning is consistent regardless of the position ""zup"" takes in the input sequence. However, when it comes to outputs, its position does matter because it changes the sequence of colors in the output. Specifically, ""zup"" outputs a single ""yellow"", but if followed by another word such as ""walm"" or ""wif"", it seems to repeat the output color corresponding to that word the number of times that word ordinarily outputs that color. 

Therefore, the induced rule for ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup converts to ""yellow"" and causes the following color word to repeat its corresponding color an equivalent number of times it would normally output. If ""zup"" is followed by no color word, it simply outputs ""yellow"".",0.9,73,zup
"Based on the given examples, the word 'bluf' correlates with the color 'red' being repeated twice in the output. The input 'bluf' always results in 'red red' regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it. Thus, the rule for 'bluf' seems to be that it translates to 'red red' in the output.

Rule: bluf -> red red",1.0,73,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to cause the output color to be red, except for when it follows an unknown word which does not have a predefined associated color. When ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"", ""lug"", ""zup"", or ""dax"", the color red is not produced. However, when it stands alone or follows ""wif"", the color red is produced. It is important to note that there is inconsistency in the pattern, as ""wif bluf"" once produces ""red red"" and another time ""red red blue"", so additional context might be needed to formulate an exact rule.

Nonetheless, from the available data and looking for the simplest pattern that fits all examples, one might tentatively propose:

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a word with an associated color, it outputs that color. When ""bluf"" is the first word or follows ""wif"", the output is red. However, given the inconsistency and lack of more examples, it is difficult to assign a more precise meaning or rule to ""bluf"".",0.5,73,bluf
"Based on the examples provided:

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" also corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" is not repeated but still results in ""red""
- ""bluf"" results in ""blue blue""

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" does not appear since the output has no ""blue""

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" results in ""blue""

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- There is no ""blue"" in the output, even though ""bluf"" is present.

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- There is no ""blue"" in the output, even though ""bluf"" is present.

The inconsistency of the presence of ""blue"" in the outputs where ""bluf"" is an input seems to indicate that ""bluf"" does not directly translate to ""blue,"" at least not consistently, nor does it directly correspond to ""blue blue"" as it did only in the first example.

However, considering all instances where ""bluf"" appears and considering the absence of any blue in the output where ""bluf"" is the last word in the sequence, we can deduce:

Rule: ""bluf"" may mean ""blue,"" but only manifests in the output when it is not the last element in the input sequence. When ""bluf"" is the final word in the input, it does not modify the output, which explains its absence from the output in the last three examples. This indicates that ""bluf"" may correspond to an action, such as duplicating the previous color, but only when it is not at the end of a sequence.

With this observation, the rule for ""bluf"" seems inconsistent with the examples given, indicating that there may be more complexity to the rule or context that has not been provided. Without further examples or clarification, the underlying rule cannot be definitively pinpointed.",0.2,73,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" Regardless of its position in a sequence or the other words present, ""bluf"" yields red in the output.

"walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.

Examples:
- ""lug walm"" resulted in ""blue blue blue"", repeating the color associated with ""lug"" three times.

"Observing the patterns in the input and output sequences provided, my induction process produces the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color that was mentioned just prior to ""walm"" twice more. 

So, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" means ""blue"" and following it with ""walm"" adds two more ""blue"". Similarly, when ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which translates to ""red"", it results in ""red red red"", as seen in the third example.

Therefore: walm -> Repeat the previous color twice more.",1.0,73,walm
"Analyzing the given examples and their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to determine the rule that defines the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

In the first example:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Here, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and we see ""blue"" repeated three times. Given that ""walm"" follows ""lug"" in the input, it is possible that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color mentioned before it.

In the second example:
Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

The sequence of ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" a tripling of ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif."" Likewise, ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow,"" tripling the output for ""zup"" (yellow). This reinforces the idea that ""walm"" might indicate a triple repetition of the preceding color.

In the third example:
Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and again, the output is ""red red red,"" tripling the color corresponding to ""wif.""

Based on these examples and the given outputs, we can deduce that the rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times in the output. In other words, ""walm"" indicates that the preceding color should be said three times.

"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""dax"" translates to a specific color output whenever it appears in an input. Comparing the outputs between examples where “dax” appears and those where it doesn’t, we can isolate the effect of “dax” on the output:

1. In the first example, ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow,"" and in the fourth example, ""wif dax zup dax"" leads to ""red green yellow green."" When comparing these two, ""walm"" is replaced by ""dax,"" and the second ""red"" becomes ""green"" in the output. 

2. Additionally, a second ""dax"" appears at the end instead of ""dax,"" which seems to replace ""zup"" causing a second ""green"" instead of a ""yellow."" This suggests a one-to-one correspondence between ""dax"" and ""green"" in the output.

3. In the third example, the sole input ""dax"" results in the output ""green,"" which directly suggests that ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

4. Again, in the fourth example, ""dax"" is associated with green both times it appears.

5. In the fifth example, ""zup lug dax"" results in ""yellow blue green,"" with ""dax"" being the last word and ""green"" being the last color.

1. Input: dax bluf wif
   Output: green green red
   
2. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

3. Input: wif zup dax bluf
   Output: red yellow green green

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

5. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

From these examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" correlates with the word directly preceding it producing the same color in the output. In every example, the word before ""bluf"" and the output color for ""bluf"" itself are the same.

For example, in input 1, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and so does ""bluf"" that follows. Similarly, in input 4, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" that follows it also translates to ""red.""

Therefore:

Rule: bluf -> has the same color output as the word immediately before it.",1.0,74,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red if preceded by wif, green if preceded by dax. Bluf changes color based on the preceding word: ""wif"" turns bluf red, and ""dax"" turns bluf green.",1.0,74,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the output color corresponds to each word in the input. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, and the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red. The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in its single appearance.

The nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color in the output sequence, and that color seems to either match the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it or, when ""bluf"" is the last word, it refers to the color of ""dax,"" which is green. In the context where ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green, and when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red. 

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" could be that it mimics the color of the preceding word, or defaults to green if there is no preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word or green if at the end.",0.8,74,bluf
"Rule: When the word ""bluf"" follows the noun, the color assigned is the last color assigned to the noun. When ""bluf"" is alone, it defaults to red.",0.8,74,bluf
"Rule: The word ""walm"" means repeating the color of the previous word.

Explanation: In each example, the color that follows ""walm"" is a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes ""walm.""

1. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.
   
2. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.

3. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is red.

4. In the fourth example, ""wif walm dax"" yields ""red red red green,"" where ""walm"" repeats the red color of ""wif,"" and then the sequence continues to ""dax,"" which is a new color, green.

5. In the last example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" demonstrating again that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it. ""walm wif"" leads to ""green red,"" showing that after the repetition induced by ""walm,"" the pattern continues with the next color word, ""wif,"" which is red.

Therefore, walm -> meaning. Walm means repeating the color of the preceding word.",1.0,74,walm
"Based on the examples given, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" is related to a repetition of the color that immediately precedes it.

In the first example, we observe 'lug walm' translating to 'blue blue blue'. The word 'lug' precedes 'walm' and the output is 'blue' repeated three times.

In the second example, 'zup walm' translates to 'yellow yellow yellow' indicating 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' and 'walm' causes it to repeat three times.

The third and fourth examples also fit this rule, with 'walm' causing the color that precedes it to repeat three times. The last example also confirms this pattern of repetition.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color word to repeat three additional times.",1.0,74,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each instance where ""walm"" appears and the corresponding output.

1. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   ""walm"" corresponds to three repetitions of ""blue.""

2. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   ""walm"" first corresponds to a repeated ""red"" (three times) before the first ""zup,"" and then it corresponds to three repetitions of ""yellow"" after ""zup lug zup.""

3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   ""walm"" corresponds to three repetitions of ""red.""

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   ""walm"" corresponds to three repetitions of ""red.""

5. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   ""walm"" corresponds to three repetitions of ""green.""

From these examples, we can see that ""walm"" seems to produce a triplet color repetition of the last color that was mentioned before it.
  
Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" could be: Walm -> causes the last color mentioned to be repeated three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" is presented in a sequence, it outputs the color corresponding to the last word prior to ""walm"" three times.",1.0,74,walm
"To induce the rule of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can examine the patterns of inputs and their corresponding outputs to determine what ""walm"" translates to in the output.

Looking at each example:

1. ""zup lug walm"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue""
   - We can see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". Since ""walm"" is the third word and the output ends with three ""blue"", it is possible that ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the word before it.

2. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" corresponds to ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". Given ""walm"" after ""wif"" resulted in two additional ""red"" (""red red red"") and after ""zup walm"" it resulted in three additional ""yellow"" (""yellow yellow yellow""), it further suggests that ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the previous word multiple times.

The repetition amount could be deduced from the examples given, as it seems the number of repetitions corresponds to the number of times the word has been seen so far, plus one.

3. ""zup bluf wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red red red""
   - ""bluf"" doesn't appear in the other examples, but we can assume it has a one-to-one correspondence with ""yellow"" like ""zup"". Since we have prior evidence that ""walm"" repeats the previous color twice after the first instance and third for the second instance, we can assume the number of repetitions increases with each occurrence of the word preceding ""walm"".

4. ""wif walm dax zup"" corresponds to ""red red red green yellow""
   - ""dax"" is a new word not seen in the previous examples, corresponding to ""green"" in this context. Since we have one instance of ""wif"" before ""walm"" without ""wif"" appearing elsewhere, ""walm"" again repeats the color of the word before it two additional times, which strengthens our initial hypothesis.

5. ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" corresponds to ""blue green yellow green green green red""
   - In this example, ""walm"" comes after two instances of ""dax,"" with the corresponding output being ""green green green,"" suggesting ""walm"" is indeed repeating the color of the word before it twice more (for a total of three times since this is the second instance of ""dax""). ""wif"" as mentioned corresponds to ""red"".

Synthesizing this information, we can induce that ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the word that precedes it as many times as that color word has appeared up to that point +1.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word, with the number of repetitions being equal to the total number of previous occurrences of that word plus one.",0.9,74,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the corresponding outputs and the context in which ""walm"" is used.

1. In the first example, ""walm"" corresponds to three instances of the word ""blue.""

Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue

2. In the second example, ""walm"" appears twice and corresponds to two sets of ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

3. In the third example, ""walm"" corresponds to two instances of the word ""red.""

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" corresponds to three instances of the word ""green.""

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" at the end corresponds to four instances of the word ""green.""

Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red

Observations:
- The examples suggest that ""walm"" does not correspond to a fixed color but rather a variable number of a certain color which repeats a number of times.
- The number of repetitions of the color seems to be influenced by the position or the sequence of the words before ""walm.""

By taking the position into account:
- When ""walm"" is the third word, as in the first example, it is followed by three repeats of ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" is the second word, as in examples two and three, it is followed by three repeats of a color (red or yellow respectively).
- When ""walm"" is between the second and third words, as in the fourth example, it is followed by three repeats of ""green.""
- When ""walm"" is the fifth word or later, as in the fifth example, it is followed by four repeats of ""green.""

A potential general rule could be:
""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color word that directly precedes it, with the number of repetitions depending on the position of ""walm"" in the sequence or possibly the color/word that immediately precedes ""walm.""

However, this pattern is inconsistent due to the changing number of repetitions and the position not strictly correlating with the number of repetitions in all cases. Let's look at the preceding colors instead:

- ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" in the first and second examples, resulting in the color ""blue"" repeating.
- ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" in the second and third examples, resulting in the color ""red"" repeating.
- ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" in the fourth and fifth examples, resulting in the color ""green"" repeating.

From this pattern, a clearer rule emerges: ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color output that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it, with the number of repetitions being equal to the number of times the word that evokes the repeated color has appeared so far in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule can be:
Rule: ""walm"" -> repeats the color output corresponding to the word immediately before it, equal to the number of times that precursor word has appeared in the sequence up to and including that instance of ""walm.""",0.8,74,walm
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,75,lug
"Based on the examples provided:

- The word ""lug"" always corresponds to the output ""blue.""
- The outputs for other nonce words (wif, walm, dax, bluf, zup) correspond to unique colors not associated with ""lug.""

Thus, we can deduce a rule for the meaning of ""lug"":

Rule: ""lug"" -> ""blue""",1.0,75,lug
"Observing the patterns between the inputs and their corresponding outputs, it seems that each word maps to a color. Let's analyze the use of ""lug"" and other words across different examples.

- In the first example, ""lug wif walm"" maps to ""blue red red red,"" where ""wif"" seems to map to ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times suggesting a repeat or extension of the preceding color.
- In the second example, ""lug dax"" maps to ""blue green,"" indicating that ""dax"" maps to ""green.""
- In the third example, ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" maps to ""red red blue green red,"" confirming that ""wif"" maps to ""red"" and ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" and ""lug"" appears once again before ""dax"" producing ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm dax lug"" maps to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue."" Here we see a new word ""zup"" associated with ""yellow,"" and considering that ""walm"" follows it repeating ""yellow,"" ""walm"" seems to indicate repetition of the color. As before, ""lug"" comes after ""dax"" and once again produces ""blue.""
- Lastly, the fifth example ""wif lug"" maps to ""red blue,"" with ""wif"" consistent in mapping to ""red,"" while ""lug"" follows, mapping to ""blue.""

Considering these observations, we can deduce that ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,75,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following associations for the nonce words presented before 'lug':

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- walm -> red (from the first example) or yellow (from the fourth example; there may be context-dependent rules that we don't have enough information to determine)
- zup -> yellow

In each instance, 'lug' is followed by the color blue, regardless of the context or the other words present in the input. This consistent association leads us to the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,75,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,75,lug
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rule:

dax -> green

The meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green"" in the given examples. Each occurrence of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. 

Rule: ""dax"" means ""green"".",1.0,75,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's examine its occurrence and the corresponding output in each example:

1. dax lug wif -> green blue red
   Here, ""dax"" occurs at the beginning and corresponds to ""green.""

2. dax zup dax -> green yellow green
   ""dax"" occurs at the beginning and the end, both times corresponding to ""green.""

3. zup dax -> yellow green
   ""dax"" occurs at the end and corresponds to ""green.""

4. dax -> green
   ""dax"" is the only word and corresponds to ""green.""

5. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   ""dax"" occurs at the beginning and corresponds to ""green.""

Based on the examples provided, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,75,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color green, irrespective of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,75,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green"" in the output. There are no instances where ""dax"" corresponds to any other color or set of conditions in the output. Thus, it seems that ""dax"" has a one-to-one relationship with the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,75,dax
"Based on the examples given, we can deduce the following mappings:

- dax = green
- lug = blue
- wif = red
- zup = yellow
- walm = red (repeated after its first occurrence)

From these examples, it appears that each input word corresponds to a specific color as an output. However, there is an anomaly in the pattern with the word ""walm,"" which is repeated and corresponds to multiple instances of the color red appearing in sequence.

So the rule here seems to be that each word corresponds to a color, except for ""walm,"" which may have a special rule that if it appears once, it generates a single red output, but when repeated, it generates additional red outputs equal to its occurrences.

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" is:

dax -> green",1.0,75,dax
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" is replaced by the color ""red"".
",1.0,75,wif
"From the given examples, we can see a pattern where the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". The other words in the examples translate to different colors, but ""wif"" remains constant in each instance. Given this information, we can deduce the following rule:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" means ""red"".",1.0,75,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,75,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" is a stand-in for the color ""red"". Here is the reasoning:

- Every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
- The word ""wif"" by itself produces the output ""red"", suggesting that it directly corresponds to that color without dependency on surrounding context.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red",1.0,75,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look for patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.
2. ""wif"" appears alone in the last example and the output is solely ""red.""

From these observations, it seems that ""wif"" correlates directly with the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Thus, we can deduce:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,75,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". There are no examples that contradict this association, and every time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" means ""yellow"".",1.0,75,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, the rule can be summarized as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,75,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. In all instances where the word ""zup"" is included, the output consistently includes the color ""yellow"". Here is the observation from the examples:

- ""zup"" alone results in ""yellow"".
- ""zup"" in a sequence with other words still results in ""yellow"" for every occurrence of ""zup"".

From this pattern, we can determine the rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,75,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples, regardless of its position within the input sequence.",1.0,75,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,75,zup
"To understand the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can examine the patterns in the words and their corresponding colors from the given examples:

1. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
2. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
3. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
4. zup wif bluf zup lug -> yellow red red yellow blue
5. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue

By looking at these examples, we can infer the following color assignments for the words that are not ""bluf"":

- zup corresponds to yellow
- wif corresponds to red
- walm corresponds to red
- lug corresponds to blue
- dax corresponds to green

Now let's look at the appearances of ""bluf"" in each example and the color that it translates to in the output:

1. zup (yellow) bluf (yellow) wif (red) walm (red)
2. lug (blue) walm (red) wif (red) bluf (red)
3. zup (yellow) dax (green) bluf (green)
4. zup (yellow) wif (red) bluf (red) zup (yellow) lug (blue)
5. lug (blue) wif (red) lug (blue) bluf (blue)

From these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. For example, if ""zup"" (yellow) comes before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" is also yellow; if ""lug"" (blue) comes before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" is also blue.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> The color of ""bluf"" is the same as the color of the word that comes immediately before it in the sequence.",1.0,75,bluf
"Based on the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color. To determine what ""bluf"" represents, look at the pattern in which colors are output in relation to the input words.

- In example one, ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red"". Since ""wif"" and ""walm"" are paired with ""red"" consistently, ""zup"" must pair with ""yellow"". That leaves ""bluf"" to correspond with the second ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" outputs ""blue blue blue red red."" Here, ""walm"" and ""wif"" again pair with ""red"", and ""lug"" is consistently paired with ""blue"". Therefore, ""bluf"" correlates with the third ""blue"".
- Example three gives us ""zup dax bluf"", producing ""yellow green green"". ""Zup"" is already known to pair with ""yellow"", and since a new color ""green"" appears with ""dax"", it's logical to connect ""green"" with ""dax"". That leaves ""bluf"" to match with the second ""green"".
- In the fourth example, ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" maps to ""yellow red red yellow blue"". We can see that ""zup"" pairs with ""yellow"", ""wif"" with ""red"", and ""lug"" with ""blue"", which means that ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red"".
- The fifth example, ""lug wif lug bluf"", translates to ""blue red blue blue"". Here, the repeat patterns are clear: ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""wif"" is ""red"". Hence ""bluf"" must also be ""blue"".

From these patterns, we can deduce that ""bluf"" represents the color ""blue"". This can be further confirmed by noticing that in each example where ""lug"" (blue) is not present before ""bluf"", ""bluf"" represents a different color other than ""blue"". But in the lines where ""lug"" does appear, ""bluf"" takes on the color ""blue"" as well. This could suggest that the meaning of ""bluf"" is dependent on the context of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> blue, with the additional rule that the color ""blue"" is only represented by ""bluf"" if ""lug"" (which also means ""blue"") has already been mentioned or is in close proximity within the sequence. If ""lug"" is not present or too far from ""bluf"" in the sequence, ""bluf"" will represent the color following the color linked to the immediately preceding nonce word.",1.0,75,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the input and output of each example given.

In the first example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red."" ""Wif"" and ""walm"" appear in other examples, so we can deduce their meanings by comparing those examples. Here, ""zup"" is paired with ""yellow,"" so it is likely that ""zup"" means ""yellow."" Since ""walm"" results in three ""red"" outputs and there are no overlaps with ""zup,"" ""walm"" likely means ""red."" That leaves ""bluf"" corresponding to the remaining ""yellow.""

In the second example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" produces ""blue blue blue red red."" Given that ""walm"" is ""red,"" we now see ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue red red"" leaving ""bluf"" to correspond with the remaining ""blue.""

The third example, ""zup dax bluf,"" becomes ""yellow green green."" ""Zup"" is previously established as ""yellow."" Since ""dax"" is not in any previous examples, we don't yet have an established meaning. Nevertheless, we see two instances of ""green"" in the output, suggesting ""dax"" means ""green"" or at least results in ""green"" twice. By the established pattern, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

The fourth example gives us ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" translated to ""yellow red red yellow blue."" ""Zup"" is again ""yellow,"" while ""wif"" is ""red."" Since the second ""zup"" is followed by the same color resulting from ""lug,"" and ""lug"" in the second example was corresponding to ""blue,"" there's an idea that ""bluf"" might shift its meaning based on what follows or precedes it, but it's not definite yet since ""bluf"" in this example corresponds to ""red.""

The fifth example, ""lug wif lug bluf,"" turns into ""blue red blue blue."" ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""Bluf"" here aligns with ""blue"" again.

By observing the patterns, it seems that ""bluf"" consistently takes on the color value that precedes it or takes the first color's value in a sequence. This indicates that ""bluf"" is a sort of a ""chameleon"" word, adopting the color value that comes immediately before it in the sequence:

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color value of the prior word in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the first word in a sequence, the rule for its meaning is not clear based on the provided examples.",0.8,75,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs:

1. `zup bluf wif walm` -> `yellow yellow red red red`
2. `lug walm wif bluf` -> `blue blue blue red red`
3. `zup dax bluf` -> `yellow green green`
4. `zup wif bluf zup lug` -> `yellow red red yellow blue`
5. `lug wif lug bluf` -> `blue red blue blue`

The observations from the patterns are as follows:

- Whenever `bluf` appears in the input, two colors appear in the output: red and blue. This suggests that ""bluf"" corresponds to two colors in the output.
- The number of times `red` appears in the output is consistent with the position of `bluf` in the input sequence — the later ""bluf"" appears, the fewer ""red"" there are.
- Looking closer, it seems that the first time a color appears in the output, it is doubled. This can be seen with `yellow` in the first example and `blue` in the second one. However, in the first example, there's an exception with ""bluf"" which outputs two colors (yellow and red) that do not follow this pattern.

Considering these observations, let's propose a rule that fits all examples:

- ""bluf"" corresponds to two colors in the output, where the first color is related to the previous noun and the second color is ""red."" 

However, when examining the third example, `zup dax bluf` -> `yellow green green`, we notice that ""bluf"" corresponds only to ""green"" and not two colors like in other cases. This suggests that our initial rule isn't entirely accurate, or there may be an exception.

A revised, but more tentative rule might be:

- ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that would appear if the previous pattern continued, but adds ""red"" if it's not already preceded by that color.

With this rule, we can infer a correspondence for ""bluf"" as follows:

- In examples 1, 2, and 5, ""bluf"" adds ""red"" because the pattern of colors that precede it does not include ""red.""
- In example 3, ""bluf"" does not add ""red"" because ""green"" continues the pattern, and ""red"" is not needed.
- In example 4, ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" because it continues the alternating pattern set by ""yellow"" and ""red"" without needing to repeat the color that was already given by ""wif.""

This rule still feels imperfect due to the ambiguity in example 3. Thus, we can denote:

Rule: Bluf -> Represents the next color in the repeating pattern, adding ""red"" if that color hasn't appeared immediately before it, except in a scenario we have not identified that causes ""bluf"" to not add ""red"", as seen in the third example.",0.6,75,bluf
"bluf -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue in the output.",0.4,75,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns for each input and their corresponding output colors. We notice that ""walm"" seems to always result in ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position within the input string. Moreover, the sequence appears to maintain a pattern related to individual words:

- ""wif"" correlates to ""red""
- ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" correlates to ""blue""
- ""dax"" correlates to ""green""

Given that ""walm"" also results in ""green,"" we can infer that ""walm"" possibly shares some properties with ""dax,"" since they produce the same color output. However, we need to differentiate ""walm"" from ""dax,"" because if they were the same, the string ""dax walm wif"" would have yielded ""green green red"" instead of ""green green green red."" The triplication of ""green"" suggests that ""walm"" has a unique property of triggering the color ""green"" for itself and the preceding word, irrespective of what the preceding word is.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

**Rule:** When ""walm"" appears in an input string, it induces the output ""green"" for itself and also causes the immediately preceding word in the input string to output ""green,"" irrespective of the usual color associated with that preceding word. If ""walm"" is the first word in the sequence, it simply outputs ""green"" for itself.",1.0,75,walm
"To figure out what ""walm"" means, we need to compare the outputs for the different input strings that include ""walm."" Let's look at where 'walm' is in each input and what the output colors correspond to:

1. Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green
2. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
3. Input: zup walm lug -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
4. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif -> Output: blue green yellow green green green red
5. Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red

Looking at the outputs, I will correlate the words to colors and identify the rule for ""walm"":

- ""wif"" consistently correlates to the color red.
- ""zup"" consistently correlates to the color yellow.
- ""lug"" consistently correlates to the color blue.
- ""dax"" consistently correlates to the color green.

Given these correlations, I can deduce that ""walm"" does the following:

- When following ""wif,"" it turns subsequent ""dax"" (example 1) and ""wif"" (example 5) into red: this suggests ""walm"" repeats the color of the word right before it.
- In isolation after ""zup,"" it simply continues the yellow pattern without changing anything (example 2): this supports the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color that came before it.
- When it follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug,"" everything remains the same (example 3): this further supports that ""walm"" is not introducing a new color, but carrying the previous color forward.
- In the longer string (example 4), it follows the same pattern: the presence of ""walm"" after ""dax"" and before ""wif"" just repeats the colors green and then red as expected.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word in the sequence.",1.0,75,walm
"Given the examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with the color red. Every output that corresponds to an input containing the word ""walm"" includes the color red. Additionally, the position of ""walm"" within the input does not appear to affect its corresponding output, which is consistently red. The other words in the input correlate with colors as well, and ""walm"" always translates to red regardless of its position or the other words present.

Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

walm -> meaning. Rule: Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the color red is included in the output at the position corresponding to ""walm"".",1.0,75,walm
"Based on the given examples, the presence of the word ""walm"" always results in the word ""green"" in the output except when ""wif"" immediately follows it, leading to ""red"" instead.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:
- walm -> green when it does not immediately precede ""wif""
- walm -> red when it immediately precedes ""wif""

In essence:

Rule: walm -> ""green"", except when followed by ""wif"", then -> ""red""",1.0,75,walm
"To determine what `walm` means, let's look for patterns associated with the word:

- In every example where ""walm"" appears, the output includes a sequence of ""green"" followed by red.
- The number of ""green""s in the output is consistent with the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence, minus one.

Let's review the examples individually:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   - ""walm"" is the second word; thus, there is one ""green"" before ""red"".

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - As the output doesn't follow the green-red pattern, it seems that ""walm"" is at the end and thus no red is exhibited.

3. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""walm"" is the second word; hence, there should be one ""green"" before blue, but it's not there, possibly an inconsistency which may suggest that the presence of ""lug"" might eliminate the ""green"".

4. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   - ""walm"" is the fifth word; thus, there are four ""green""s followed by ""red"".

5. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   - ""walm"" is the second word; hence, there is one ""green"" before ""red"".

Taking this analysis into account, it seems ""walm"" indicates a rule where the number of ""green""s before ""red"" corresponds to its position in the sequence minus one. However, we also have an outlier case (case 2) where ""walm"" as the last word does not follow this rule, and in case 3 where ""lug"" seems to influence the output in an unexpected way.

Given this pattern and the possible irregularities, the tentative rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: ""walm"" in the input sequence results in an output of green(s) corresponding to its position minus one, followed by ""red"", unless it's at the end of an input sequence or influenced by certain other words like ""lug"".",0.7,75,walm
lug -> blue,1.0,76,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the outputs. Each time ""lug"" is present in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,76,lug
"lug -> blue

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Hence, the rule I deduce is:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,76,lug
dax -> green,1.0,76,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" In each example, whenever the word ""dax"" is used in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position of the output.

Therefore, the rule is:
dax -> green",1.0,76,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,76,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in each provided example.",1.0,76,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.",1.0,76,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the examples and the corresponding outputs:

1. ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" gives ""yellow yellow red green red yellow""
2. ""dax wif"" gives ""green red""
3. ""zup wif zup"" gives ""yellow red yellow""
4. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" gives ""blue red green green red blue""
5. ""lug walm wif lug"" gives ""blue blue blue red blue""

Looking at examples 2 and 3, the word ""wif"" appears between two identical words (""dax"" and ""zup"", respectively) and the corresponding output for ""wif"" is ""red"". In example 5, ""wif"" also appears between two identical words (""lug"") and the corresponding output is again ""red"".

In examples 1 and 4, ""wif"" is preceded and followed by different words, and the output for ""wif"" in each case is still ""red"".

From these observations, we can infer that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"", regardless of the context it appears in.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,76,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color red irrespective of its position or the other words around it.",1.0,76,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we will compare the inputs with their associated outputs and look for patterns.

Looking at the first example and comparing the strings and colors:
- ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green""
- The word ""wif"" appears between colors that are not the same (yellow-red, green-red, and yellow-red sequences)

In the second example:
- ""dax"" maps to ""green""
- After ""wif,"" we see ""red""

In the third example:
- ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" and is preceded and followed by ""yellow""

In the fourth example:
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" as well
- ""wif"" appears before a ""red"" each time, with different colored words on either side of the instances of ""wif""

In the fifth example: 
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""walm"" translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" is followed by ""red""

Based on the above observations, the word ""wif"" is followed by the color ""red"" each time, regardless of the colors that precede it. However, ""wif"" never appears at the beginning or end of an input sequence, only between other words.

The rule seems to be:
- ""wif"" is a placeholder for the color that directly precedes a ""red"" in the output sequence.

Rule: wif -> precedes the color red in the output sequence regardless of the preceding word's color.",0.9,76,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to changing the color associated with the word that follows it. The rule seems to be that whenever ""wif"" appears before a word, the color output for that word is altered to a specific different color. Here's the breakdown of the observed changes:

- ""zup"" generally corresponds to ""yellow,"" but when it's preceded by ""wif"" it becomes ""red.""
- ""dax"" generally corresponds to ""green,"" but when it's preceded by ""wif"" it becomes ""red.""
- ""lug"" generally corresponds to ""blue,"" but when it's preceded by ""wif"" it becomes ""red.""
- ""bluf"" seems to be an exception, as it initially corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""wif"" it stays ""green.""

Notice that while ""wif"" changes ""zup"", ""dax"", and ""lug"" to red, it doesn't change ""bluf."" This suggests that the alteration caused by ""wif"" might be specific to only certain words or that ""bluf"" follows a different rule. However, based on the majority of the examples, the best general rule we can induce is:

Rule: ""wif"" changes the color associated with the following word to ""red,"" with a potential exception in the case of ""bluf"" where the color remains ""green."" 

wif -> changes the following word's associated color to ""red"" (except possibly when followed by ""bluf"").",0.8,76,wif
Rule: wif -> inverts the color association of the following word to its complementary color.,0.0,76,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,76,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the following pattern seems to emerge for the nonce word ""zup"":

- In every instance, ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".

Thus, the rule for what ""zup"" means is:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,76,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the provided examples, regardless of its position in the sequence or the context of other words around it.",1.0,76,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow.""

Rule:
zup -> yellow",1.0,76,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,76,zup
"Rule: bluf -> yellow when following zup, blue when following lug, and red when following wif.",1.0,76,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" is used to repeat the color of the word that comes before it. Therefore, when ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" the color repeated is yellow; when it appears after ""lug,"" it is blue; and when it appears after ""dax,"" it is green. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the color repeated is red.

Therefore:

bluf -> means to repeat the color of the preceding word. Rule: If the preceding word represents a color, ""bluf"" represents that same color.",1.0,76,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color that comes right before it in the sequence.

Explanation:
In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which translates to the color blue. Hence ""bluf"" translates to blue. This seems consistent across all the other examples, where ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that comes right before it:

- In the second example, ""lug"" is blue, and ""bluf"" coming after ""lug"" means ""bluf"" is translated to blue.
- In the third example, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""bluf"" coming after ""zup"" means ""bluf"" is translated to yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" is blue, and ""bluf"" following ""lug"" is thus translated to blue.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" following ""wif"" translates to red.

The rule is consistent with all given examples, so the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to mean ""take the color of the preceding word.""

bluf -> the color of the preceding word.",1.0,76,bluf
"Based on the examples given, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" represents a color, but the color it represents changes dependent on the word that precedes it. Here are the rules that can be deduced from each line of the example:

1. When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow."" This suggests that ""bluf"" might mean ""yellow"" in this context.

2. The second example again has ""zup"" preceding ""bluf,"" which gives us ""yellow yellow.""

3. The third example is simply ""zup bluf"" without any additional context, and the output is ""yellow yellow"" again, reinforcing the possible rule that ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" after ""zup.""

4. However, the fourth example contradicts this because ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is ""blue blue."" This indicates that ""bluf"" takes its meaning from the word that comes right before it.

5. The fifth example shows that when ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red,"" supporting the rule that ""bluf"" changes its meaning depending on the preceding word.

Based on the above observations, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color represented by the preceding word. If ""zup"" is before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" means ""yellow."" If ""lug"" is before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" means ""blue."" If ""dax"" is before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" means ""green."" If ""wif"" is before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" means ""red.""",1.0,76,bluf
"Rule: bluf represents the repeating color from the previous item in the sequence.

Explanation: 
- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" again.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" again.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" again.

This pattern implies that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding item in the sequence. When there is no color before ""bluf,"" the output is not provided in the examples, so the behavior of ""bluf"" on its own is not fully determinable from the given examples.

bluf -> the same color as the previous item in the sequence.",0.8,76,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to repeated tokens of a color that directly follows in the output. Each instance of ""walm"" leads to three repetitions of a specific color in the output:

- In the first example, ""zup dax walm"" in input corresponds to ""yellow green green green"" in output, inferring that ""walm"" causes the word ""green"" to repeat three times.
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" in input corresponds to ""green green green"" in output, supporting the earlier inference.
- In the third example, ""zup walm lug"" in input corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue"" in output, suggesting again that ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times.
- Similarly, in the fourth and fifth examples, ""lug walm"" corresponds to three repeated instances of the color ""blue.""

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the next color word in the sequence to be repeated three times.",1.0,76,walm

Example 5:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
Pattern: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue.""

Based on these observations, it seems that 'walm' takes on the color of the word that comes immediately before it and repeats that color three times in the output. Therefore, the rule for 'walm' seems to be repeating the color associated with the preceding word thrice.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.",1.0,76,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" consistently corresponds to a sequence of three identical colors in the output. The specific color that appears in the sequence of three depends on the word preceding ""walm."" Here's the relationship between the preceding word and the color:

- dax walm => green green green
- zup walm => yellow yellow yellow
- lug walm => blue blue blue

So, the usage of ""walm"" depends on the context, specifically the word that comes before it. The rule appears to be that ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it, in a sequence of three.

Rule: Walm -> A repetition of three of the same color, where the color is determined by the word immediately preceding ""walm"".",1.0,76,walm
"walm -> three times the color corresponding to the word before it.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, it translates to the color associated with that preceding word, repeated three times.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" translates to repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. Here is the analysis:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows the word ""dax"", which outputs ""green"", and then walm results in ""green green green"".
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows the word ""dax"", and again, we see ""green green green"".
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows the word ""zup"", which outputs ""yellow"", and then walm results in ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows the word ""lug"", which outputs ""blue"", and then walm results in ""blue blue blue"".

Rule: ""zup"" -> ""yellow""",1.0,77,zup
"Observing the patterns in the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the output of having two color words that are the same. Additionally, we see that each word before ""bluf"" has a distinct corresponding color in the output.

Let's break down the instances:

1. ""walm"" consistently results in ""yellow.""
2. ""wif"" consistently results in ""red.""
3. ""dax"" consistently results in ""green.""
4. ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue.""

Given this pattern, ""bluf"" seems to signify the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. For example:

- In ""zup walm lug wif bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" hence the output ""red red.""
- In ""dax bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and thus the output is ""green green.""
- In ""lug bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" giving us the output ""blue blue.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is: ""bluf"" results in two consecutive words in the output that are the same color as the word that comes immediately before ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color associated with the preceding word in the output.",1.0,77,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> the color associated with the word preceding it. If the preceding word is 'lug', the color is blue. If the preceding word is 'dax', the color is green. If there's no color associated with the preceding word (e.g., 'wif' or 'zup' before the first instance of 'bluf'), then the color is red for 'wif' and yellow for 'zup'.",1.0,77,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" maps to a color, but the specific color seems to be determined by the word that precedes it. Here is the rule induction based on the examples:

1. When ""wif"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is red.
2. When ""dax"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is green.
3. When ""lug"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is blue.

If we consider ""zup"" before ""bluf,"" it gets tricky because ""zup walm lug"" outputs three yellows, and ""wif bluf"" results in red. In this case, ""zup"" on its own does not directly map to ""bluf,"" and because we don’t see any examples of just ""zup bluf,"" we can't define a color for ""bluf"" following ""zup."" However, since ""walm"" and ""lug"" both precede a yellow and a blue respectively in that sequence, it is possible that ""zup"" itself does not change the color represented by ""bluf,"" but instead, the sequence ""zup walm lug"" alters it.

Thus, the rule for what ""bluf"" maps to seems to be dependent on the immediately preceding word. Here's the induction of that rule:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" changes to a specific color depending on the word that comes immediately before it in the sequence:
- ""wif bluf"" -> red
- ""dax bluf"" -> green
- ""lug bluf"" -> blue

Without further examples, particularly ones showing ""bluf"" with different preceding words, it's challenging to establish a definitive rule for all cases. However, with the given examples, the above rule induction should hold.",1.0,77,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word `bluf` determines the color of the output corresponding to the word that appears just before it. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, `wif bluf` leads to ""red red,"" which suggests that `wif` corresponds to red when followed by `bluf`.
- In the second and third examples, `dax bluf` leads to ""green green,"" which suggests that `dax` corresponds to green when followed by `bluf`.
- In the fourth and fifth examples, `lug bluf` leads to ""blue blue,"" which suggests that `lug` corresponds to blue when followed by `bluf`.

The pattern indicates that the word before `bluf` sets the color, and `bluf` causes the color to be repeated once. There's no case where `bluf` is followed by a color different from the one set by the preceding word, which would have given us additional insight into `bluf`'s rule. Additionally, in the first example, although `zup` precedes `lug wif bluf`, ""yellow"" precedes the sequence before the ""red red"" which is indicative of `wif bluf`, and this ""yellow"" is not repeated, suggesting that `bluf`'s duplicating effect does not extend beyond the immediate pair it follows. 

Hence, the rule seems to be:

Rule: When `bluf` is used after a word, it repeats the output color generated by the preceding word.",0.9,77,bluf
"First, let's identify the patterns for words besides ""bluf"" to understand their outputs:

- ""zup"" consistently outputs ""yellow"".
- ""wif"" consistently outputs ""red"".
- ""lug"" outputs ""blue"" when followed by ""bluf"" but ""yellow"" when followed by ""zup"" (so it changes depending on what follows).
- ""dax"" outputs ""green"" when followed by ""bluf"".

Now focusing on ""bluf"", we see that:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output includes ""blue red red"". Since ""wif"" outputs ""red"", the ""blue"" here is directly associated with ""bluf"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green green"". However, since ""dax"" by itself is associated with ""green"", we cannot deduce the color associated with ""bluf"" here.
- In the third example, ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" outputs ""green green red yellow red"". Again, ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red"". ""Bluf"" seems to not change the output from the previous ""dax"".
- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue"". Since we already determined that ""lug"" alone switches its output color based on what follows and outputs ""blue"" when followed by ""bluf"", it suggests that ""bluf"" here might be ""blue"" as well.
- In the fifth example, ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"" outputs ""blue blue red blue blue yellow"". If we look at the sequence ""lug bluf"", it outputs ""blue blue"" both times it appears.

From the above analysis, it seems most consistent that ""bluf"" represents ""blue"". However, we also need to account for the influence of other words on the output, especially that of ""lug"" and ""dax"". ""Lug"" changes its output to ""blue"" when followed by ""bluf"" instead of ""yellow"", and ""dax"" retains its green output.

Rule: bluf -> ""blue"", taking into account that the output of ""bluf"" may not be explicitly represented if the preceding word determines the color (""dax"" -> ""green"").",0.9,77,bluf

If ""walm"" is the first word, the color yellow is repeated three times, which might imply that ""walm"" defaults to yellow when no preceding word is given for context.",1.0,77,walm
"Given the input and output examples provided, we can observe the following patterns associated with the outputs:

1. ""dax"" seems to consistently translate to ""green.""
2. ""wif"" appears to consistently translate to ""red.""
3. ""lug"" seems to consistently translate to ""blue.""
4. ""zup"" appears to correspond with ""yellow"" when at the beginning, but with no clear pattern when succeeding other words.

Now let's examine the instances of ""walm"":

- In every instance where ""walm"" is present, the word after ""walm"" translates to the same color as the word before ""walm.""
- When ""walm"" is both preceded and followed by words, it seems to cause repetition of the color of the word that precedes it.
- When ""walm"" stands at the end (Example: ""dax lug walm""), it still causes the repetition of blue, suggesting ""lug"" influenced the output.
- When ""walm"" stands alone after a word (Examples: ""zup walm"" and ""dax wif walm""), it causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the word before ""walm.""

Therefore, we can deduce that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,77,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I will systematically assess its occurrences and the outputs provided in each case. By examining the differences in input and corresponding output sequences, I can infer the rule or pattern governing the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

Consider the following observations:

1. When ""walm"" appears after ""dax lug"" as in the first string, the output is ""blue blue blue,"" which suggests that ""walm"" here could mean three consecutive ""blues.""

2. When ""walm"" appears alone after ""dax lug"" in the second string, the output is still ""blue blue blue,"" which confirms that ""walm"" at least in the context of following ""dax lug"" could mean the same as above.

3. When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" in the fourth example, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" might generalize to repeating the color that comes before it thrice.

4. In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green green,"" which further supports that ""walm"" means to repeat the color corresponding to the word before it three times.

5. Finally, when ""walm"" follows ""dax wif"" in the fifth example, the output is ""red red red,"" strengthening the rule that ""walm"" involves repeating the last color mentioned three times.

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times.

Please keep in mind that without more examples or context, our induction might not be entirely accurate, and additional examples could further refine or even contradict this rule.",1.0,77,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the input-output pairs and identify a pattern.

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

Looking at this sequence, we can see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also to ""red."" Where ""walm"" appears, a sequence of ""blue"" begins and continues until another color-coded word appears. 

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Here, the sequence starts with ""green"" for ""dax,"" one ""blue"" for ""lug,"" and then ""walm"" is followed by a continuation of ""blue."" This reinforces the idea that ""walm"" causes a continuation of the previously mentioned color until another color word appears.

Input: zup wif dax walm
Output: yellow red green green green

In this sequence, ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" After ""dax,"" ""walm"" appears and the output is continued ""green."" This further supports that ""walm"" continues the color mentioned before it.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

""Zup"" is ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" the color continues as ""yellow,"" which again supports the previous inference.

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and the presence of ""walm"" continues the ""red"" that comes just before ""walm.""

Rule:
Based on the above examples, it seems that ""walm"" continues the color of the word that comes immediately before it, until a new color word is mentioned. So if ""walm"" follows a word that has been associated with a color, the color repeats for the occurrence of ""walm.""

5. ""zup bluf lug zup"" produces ""yellow yellow blue yellow."" The word ""zup"" before ""bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow.""

From these examples, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word that came before it, repeating that color in the output. 

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,78,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" correlates with a repeated color output that matches the color output of the word preceding ""bluf."" For instance:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and following ""bluf,"" the output is ""red.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and following ""bluf,"" the output is ""green.""

- In the fourth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and following ""bluf,"" the output is ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and following ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow.""

Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it causes the output color to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,78,bluf
"Analyzing the examples provided, where ""bluf"" appears in various positions and combinations with the words ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug,"" and is paired with a color in the outputs:

- In every instance of ""bluf,"" no matter what word it follows or precedes, ""bluf"" consistently corresponds with the color ""green.""
- ""Bluf"" never changes its output color based on the position in the sequence or the neighboring words.

Given this consistent pattern across all examples, the rule can be concluded as:

Bluf -> meaning: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green."" 

Rule: Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output is ""green.""",1.0,78,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following color associations:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

The second color in the output always corresponds to the nonce word ""bluf"" following one of the already translated words. The color ""bluf"" represents varies, but is consistent with the color associated with the word that comes right before it. Therefore, we can induce the rule for ""bluf"" as follows:

bluf -> The same color as the word before it.

Rule: If a word (X) is followed by the nonce word ""bluf"", then ""bluf"" will have the same output color as the word (X) preceding it.",1.0,78,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that comes next in the sequence ""green, green, red, yellow, red"" after the color that is represented by the word that precedes it. Let's look at the patterns.

- ""dax"" consistently corresponds with the color green.
- ""wif"" correlates with the color red.
- ""zup"" corresponds with the color yellow.
- ""lug"" is only mentioned once, and it follows ""bluf,"" corresponding with the color blue.

Let's check this against the examples:

1. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
   Output: green green red yellow red
   Interpretation: ""dax"" is green, and ""bluf"" after ""dax"" is the next color in the sequence, which is green again. Then we start the sequence over after ""bluf"" hits red, so the ""wif"" that follows is red.

2. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green
   Interpretation: ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"" which is green, so ""bluf"" is the next color, green, according to the sequence.

3. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow
   Interpretation: Again, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green) and the next color in the sequence is green.

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   Interpretation: ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red), and the next color in the sequence after red is red itself as the pattern ""green, green, red, yellow, red"" indicates.

5. Input: zup bluf lug zup
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow
   Interpretation: ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), and the next color in the sequence after yellow is red, but since the output is blue, which is out of the pattern, ""lug"" seems to be a special case that changes the expected output to blue.

Given that ""lug"" deviates from the sequence, it seems to reset the pattern or represent a wildcard of sorts. To account for this, ""bluf"" should mean ""the next color in the sequence starting from green after the color denoted by the preceding word, unless followed by 'lug' which changes the output to blue"".

Rule: bluf -> the next color in the sequence ""green, green, red, yellow, red"" following the color represented by the preceding word, with a special exception when followed by ""lug"" which changes the output color to blue.",0.8,78,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color related to the preceding word. To deduce the rule for ""walm,"" let's look at the first example:

Input: wif walm zup walm
Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow

The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" and following ""walm,"" the color ""red"" is repeated twice. Similarly, ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" the color ""yellow"" is also repeated twice. 

Let's apply this understanding to the rest of the inputs:

- Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
  Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
  ""Lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated twice.

- Input: zup bluf wif walm
  Output: yellow yellow red red red
  ""Wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated twice.

- Input: zup walm
  Output: yellow yellow yellow
  ""Zup"" is ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated twice more.

- Input: zup lug walm
  Output: yellow blue blue blue
  ""Lug"" is ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated twice.

Rule: walm -> triggers a repetition of the color associated with the previous word twice.",1.0,78,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in each given example. We'll correlate the occurrences of ""walm"" to the output colors:

1. ""wif walm zup walm"" -> red red red yellow yellow yellow
2. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" -> blue blue blue green red blue red
3. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> yellow yellow red red red
4. ""zup walm"" -> yellow yellow yellow
5. ""zup lug walm"" -> yellow blue blue blue

Now, let's break down the occurrences:

- In the 1st example, ""wif"" correlates with ""red."" The ""walm"" that follows leads to a duplication of ""yellow"" twice, suggesting that ""walm"" causes the duplication of the next color.
  
- In the 2nd example, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue."" ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" which does not appear elsewhere, but ""wif"" does follow and is known to be ""red."" The only new color following ""walm"" is ""green,"" which suggests that ""walm"" may involve changing the color code of the word following it.

- In the 3rd example, we again see ""wif"" corresponding to ""red."" ""walm"" is followed by the third ""red,"" indicating that the effect of ""walm"" might again be repeating or duplicating the subsequent color.

- In the 4th example, ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated two more times without any additional words that could have produced ""yellow."" This indicates that ""walm"" likely causes the repetition.

- In the 5th example, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated multiple times as well.

By examining these patterns, we can propose the following rule for the meaning of ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the next word to be repeated two additional times.

Thus, walm -> causes the next color to be replicated two more times.",0.9,78,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", we will first need to identify patterns from the provided examples and their outputs in terms of color sequences.

Here are the examples:

1. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
   
2. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   
3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   
4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   
5. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue

Let's analyze the inputs and outputs:

- In example 1, the sequence red red red is followed by the word ""walm"", and then the color sequence repeats three times with yellow. This suggests that ""walm"" may involve a repetition of the color corresponding to the word present before ""walm"". 

- In example 2, we can't immediately see a clear pattern for ""walm"". However, we note that ""lug"" corresponds to a color change from ""red"" to ""blue"" after the appearance of ""walm"".

- In example 3, ""walm"" is at the end, and it's preceded by ""wif"" which corresponds to a red color. The output after ""walm"" shows a repetition of red twice.

- In example 4, ""zup walm"" corresponds to the output ""yellow yellow yellow"", so ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of the color for ""zup"" which is ""yellow"".

- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output is ""blue blue blue"", once again indicating a repetition of the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"".

From these observations, we can induce the following rule:

""walm"" -> meaning: Causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the preceding word input three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" is mentioned after a word, repeat the color associated with that word three times in the output.",0.8,78,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at how it affects the output in each example:

1. In the first input ""wif walm zup walm,"" the appearance of ""wif"" results in a singular ""red,"" but the appearance of ""walm"" results in three ""reds"" followed by ""walm"" again, resulting in two ""yellows."" This implies that ""walm"" may be associated with a repetition of the previous color, but not consistently since it doesn't repeat ""yellow.""

2. In the second input ""lug walm dax wif lug wif,"" after ""lug,"" which produces two ""blues,"" ""walm"" does not follow with the same color; instead, it generates ""green."" ""Wif"" following ""dax"" is consistent with ""red"" as before.

3. The third input ""zup bluf wif walm"" follows ""wif"" with ""red,"" as previously seen, and ""walm"" follows with two repetitions of ""red,"" which would suggest that ""walm"" again relates to the repetition of the previous color output.

4. In the fourth input ""zup walm,"" after ""zup,"" which produces ""yellow,"" ""walm"" continues with three ""yellows,"" in line with the idea that ""walm"" may signify a repetition.

5. The fifth input ""zup lug walm,"" after ""lug,"" which produces two ""blues,"" ""walm"" continues with three ""blues,"" reinforcing the idea that ""walm"" might relate to repeating the color indicated by the previous word.

Based on these observations, the most consistent rule we can extract is that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color output that directly precedes it and is associated with the previous word. The number of repetitions appears to be three, except when ""walm"" follows itself, in which case the number of repetitions is inconsistent.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes directly before it, typically in a set of three repetitions.",0.8,78,walm
"Analyzing the input-output pairs, it seems that the presence of the word ""walm"" significantly influences the output color sequence. Starting with the presumption that individual words correspond to colors, I'll analyze each instance:

The first pairing shows that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" when followed by ""walm,"" which also results in two additional ""red"" outputs followed by ""yellow"" outputs.

In the second instance, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red."" However, when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it's not clear what ""dax"" corresponds to, yet ""walm"" results in a single ""green.""

The third pairing confirms ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" ""Walm"" following ""wif"" results in two additional ""red"" outputs.

The fourth example shows that ""zup walm"" results in three ""yellow"" outputs.

The fifth example demonstrates that after ""zup"" and ""lug"" (yellow and blue), ""walm"" leads to three ""blue"" outputs.

From these observations, it appears that ""walm"" results in a repeater or intensifier effect of the last color word mentioned, with the exception of being preceded by ""dax,"" where it resulted in ""green."" Yet, this exception isn't enough without further context or examples to establish whether ""dax"" is a special case or if there's an additional underlying pattern that isn't immediately clear.

Rule: walm -> ""walm"" seems to repeat the color word immediately preceding it multiple times in the output sequence. If ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it results in ""green,"" indicating there may be context-dependent rules or that ""dax"" uniquely influences the meaning of ""walm.""",0.7,78,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's look at the outputs corresponding to the inputs involving ""lug"" while also taking into account the other words and their respective outputs:

1. dax lug bluf dax -> green blue blue green
2. wif lug -> red blue
3. lug wif zup wif -> blue red yellow red
4. zup wif lug -> yellow red blue
5. zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green green red

Let's match the inputs with ""lug"" to their outputs:

1. dax (green) lug (blue) bluf (blue) dax (green)
2. wif (red) lug (blue)
3. lug (blue) wif (red) zup (yellow) wif (red)
4. zup (yellow) wif (red) lug (blue)
5. zup (yellow) lug (blue) wif (red) dax (green) bluf (green) wif (red)

Based on the given examples, it consistently appears that ""lug"" is paired with the output ""blue."" Thus, lug likely means blue.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,79,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,79,lug

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" appears to correspond to the color ""green."" This can be deduced by examining the input and output pairs and focusing on when the word ""dax"" appears and what color is mentioned in the corresponding output. For instance, every time ""dax"" is present, the color ""green"" appears in the output.

Here's the analysis:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output sequence.
- In the second example, ""dax"" appears third in the input and ""green"" is the third color in the output sequence.
- In the third example, ""dax"" is the first word following ""wif,"" and ""green"" is the first color following ""red"" in the output, indicating ""wif"" might mean ""red"" and ""dax"" means ""green.""
- The fourth example again shows ""dax"" following ""lug,"" and ""green"" follows ""blue"" in the output.
- The fifth example shows ""dax"" as the third word, following ""lug"" and ""walm,"" while ""green"" is the fourth color in the output, following three ""blue"" which correspond to ""lug"" and ""walm.""

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,79,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" consistently. Here is the analysis:

- In the first example, ""wif dax lug"" corresponds to ""red green blue."" The words ""wif"" and ""lug"" correlate to ""red"" and ""blue"" respectively, leaving ""dax"" to mean ""green.""
- In the second example, ""lug zup dax wif zup"" translates to ""blue yellow green red yellow."" Again, the positions of the known words suggest that ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- In the third example, ""dax wif"" becomes ""green red,"" with ""wif"" already established as ""red,"" reinforcing that ""dax"" means ""green.""
- The fourth example, ""lug dax bluf,"" translates to ""blue green green."" Since ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""bluf"" seems to be a repeat of the color that follows it, this leaves ""dax"" as ""green"" once more.
- Finally, the fifth example, ""lug walm dax,"" turns into ""blue blue blue green."" Here, ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""walm"" echoes the previous color (""blue"" in this case), which means ""dax"" must be ""green"" to fit the pattern.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,79,dax
"Analyzing the input and corresponding output sequences, it is possible to discern the pattern that associates specific words with colors:

- ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow""

By comparing the input and output sequences, we can determine the meaning of ""dax"":

1. In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" since ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""lug"" is ""blue"".
2. In the second example, the pattern holds where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", fitting with the sequence.
3. In the third example, ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green,"" maintaining consistency with the previous instances.
4. The fourth example includes ""bluf,"" which hasn't been defined, but given the output ""green"" after ""dax,"" it can be surmised that ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green,"" indicating a possibility that ""dax"" can signify the same color as the following word or maintain its color ""green"" when followed by an undefined word.
5. The fifth example has ""walm,"" which outputs ""blue,"" followed by ""dax,"" which again corresponds to ""green."" However, it is notable that ""walm"" gives another ""blue"" output, suggesting that ""walm"" shares the color output with ""lug.""

With these examples, it is apparent that the rule is consistent:

Rule: dax -> green

""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it.",1.0,79,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that each word seems to correspond to a color. By examining the instances where ""dax"" appears, we can test what color it may correspond to:

- ""wif dax lug"" corresponds to ""red green blue"". ""wif"" must mean red and ""lug"" must mean blue because they consistently produce those colors in other examples. This suggests ""dax"" means green.
- ""lug zup dax wif zup"" corresponds to ""blue yellow green red yellow."" By matching the known words to their colors, ""dax"" falls in the place of green once again.
- ""dax wif"" corresponds to ""green red."" We know ""wif"" means red, so ""dax"" is green.
- ""lug dax bluf"" corresponds to ""blue green green."" ""lug"" is known to mean blue, and because ""dax"" appears before a word we haven't seen before that outputs green (""bluf""), we can assume that ""dax"" is green, and ""bluf"" also means green.
- ""lug walm dax"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue green."" Here it's clear that ""lug"" means blue, and since ""walm"" appears in a position that yields blue, we can deduce that ""walm"" means blue, leaving ""dax"" to mean green at the end of the sequence.

In every example, ""dax"" is associated with the color green. Therefore, we can conclude the rule:

dax -> green",1.0,79,dax
"Based on the given examples, it seems that 'wif' consistently corresponds to the output of 'red'. No matter the position in the input sequence or the surrounding words ('zup', 'dax', 'walm'), the presence of 'wif' always results in adding 'red' to the output sequence. There are two instances where 'wif' is the only word in the input, and both times the output is solely 'red'.

"Based on the provided examples, we can establish a pattern for how the nonce word ""walm"" translates into the output:

- In every instance, the word immediately before ""walm"" is repeated in the output after its initial color translation.
- The word repeated is always translated into the color associated with its output when not followed by ""walm.""
- The repetition count varies depending on how many times ""walm"" appears.

Here are the translations we can deduce from the examples given:

- ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

Now, with the application of ""walm,"" we see the following transformations:

1. In the first example, ""lug"" (blue) is repeated twice after ""walm.""
2. In the second example, ""dax"" (green) is repeated thrice after ""walm.""
3. In the third example, ""zup"" (yellow) is repeated twice after ""walm.""
4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" (green) is repeated once and ""wif"" (red) once after ""walm.""

The rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows: when ""walm"" follows a word, it causes the translation of that word to appear an additional number of times equal to the number of ""walm"" appearances immediately succeeding the word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the translation of the previous word based on the number of ""walm"" occurrences that follow it.",1.0,79,walm
"Analyzing the given examples, we can observe the following patterns:

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

In all the examples, when the word 'walm' appears in the input, the color 'yellow' appears in the output. Moreover, 'yellow' repeats the number of times equal to the last mentioned color before 'walm'. For instance, in the last example, 'lug' which corresponds to 'blue' is mentioned once before 'walm', so in the output 'yellow' is repeated once after every occurrence of 'blue'.

Therefore, based on these observations, the rule for 'walm' can be described as follows:

Rule: 'walm' in the input results in the output repeating the last mentioned color before it, replaced with 'yellow', as many times as the last mentioned color was repeated before 'walm'.

In other words, 'walm' -> meaning: Replace the last color mentioned before 'walm' with 'yellow', repeating it as many times as the last color was mentioned.",0.9,79,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" represents a repeating pattern of the color that immediately precedes ""walm."" The repetition is twice the number of times the preceding color word occurs before ""walm."" Here is the observed pattern:

1. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" The ""lug"" before ""walm"" appears once and the pattern ""yellow"" is repeated two times after ""walm"".

2. ""dax zup dax walm"" translates to ""green yellow green green green."" The ""dax"" before ""walm"" appears twice, and the pattern ""green"" is repeated four times after ""walm"".

3. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow."" The ""zup"" before ""walm"" appears once and the pattern ""yellow"" is repeated two times after ""walm"".

4. ""dax walm wif zup"" translates to ""green green green red yellow."" The ""dax"" before ""walm"" appears once and the pattern ""green"" is repeated two times after ""walm"".

5. ""wif lug walm"" translates to ""red blue blue blue."" The ""lug"" before ""walm"" appears once and the pattern ""blue"" is repeated two times after ""walm"".

So, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color that precedes ""walm"" twice as many times as it occurs before ""walm"". If the color before ""walm"" appears n times, repeat it 2n times after ""walm"".",0.8,79,walm

- ""dax"" corresponds to green, and when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green"" (repeating the color green as indicated by ""dax"").
- ""wif"" corresponds to red, and when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""blue blue"" (repeating the color blue as indicated by ""wif,"" which is the final color repetition from the last word - ""lug"").

"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" by examining the consistencies in the input and output pairs.

Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output. Moreover, ""lug"" seems independent of its position in the input sequence, as it consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of where it is placed. For example, when ""lug"" is at the beginning, middle, or end of the sequence, the color ""blue"" appears in the respective position in the output sequence.

Additionally, it's worth noting that other nonce words in the input such as ""wif"" and ""dax"" appear to consistently map to ""red"" and ""green"" respectively, based on their outputs.

This consistency allows us to derive the meaning without a dependence on surrounding words or order.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,80,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Each instance of ""lug"" in the input results in ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,80,lug

- When ""dax"" occurs alone, the output is ""green"".
- When ""dax"" is accompanied by ""wif"", the output associated with ""dax"" is still ""green"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- Even when ""dax"" is preceded or followed by other words, such as ""bluf"" or ""zup"", the output for ""dax"" remains ""green"".
- ""zup"" preceding ""dax"" results in ""yellow"" preceding ""green"".
- ""lug"" between ""dax"" and ""wif"" is associated with ""blue"".

Therefore, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds consistently to the color ""green"", regardless of its position in the input sequence.

- ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""green.""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

However, there is an inconsistency with ""bluf"" as it is given the output green in the third example but does not appear in the other examples for further clarification. Since ""bluf"" only appears once, we cannot firmly establish its meaning and it might be a typographical error or an exception. Assuming ""bluf"" is meant to be ""dax"" or has the same output in this context, we would continue with the rule for ""dax.""

We can deduce the following:

wif -> red

And based on the third example, we see that 'bluf' must also mean green because it corresponds to the second green in ""red green green."" 

In the fourth example, 'zup' produces yellow, as we can deduce by its position and resulting color.

The fifth example confirms that 'lug' represents blue since it is in the third position and the output color in the third position is blue.

Considering the consistent output color for 'dax' across all examples, regardless of position or surrounding words, the rule seems to be:

"walm -> meaning. The meaning of the word ""walm"" seems to correspond to repeating the color associated with the preceding word. Rule:

"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" I will analyze the pattern between the input and output.

In the first example, ""lug"" is associated with a sequence of ""red blue.""

In the third example, ""lug"" appears twice, and each time it is followed by ""blue.""

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

In the fourth example, ""lug"" appears at the beginning and yields ""blue.""

Input: lug dax bluf
Output: blue green green

Likewise, in the fifth example, ""lug"" also corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: zup wif lug dax
Output: yellow red blue green

From these examples, we see that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or other words present.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,81,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug"" based on the provided examples, let's look at the pattern of colors associated with each word:

- ""dax"" seems to consistently map to ""green.""
- ""wif"" seems to consistently map to ""red.""
- ""zup"" seems to correlate with ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" correlates with ""yellow,"" but with additional ""yellow"" outputs following it. It might be that ""walm"" outputs an extra ""yellow"" for every occurrence.
- ""bluf"" correlates with the color ""green,"" similar to ""dax.""

Now, analysing the outputs for ""lug"" within different contexts:

1. In the first example, ""lug"" following ""zup walm"" yields a single ""red,"" but ""walm"" itself seems to add additional ""yellow,"" so it seems like ""lug"" does not contribute to the ""yellow"" output here.
2. In the second example, ""lug"" at the end generates a single ""blue.""
3. In the third example, ""lug"" after ""bluf"" yields two ""blue"" outputs, and a ""lug"" at the end gives one ""blue.""
4. In the fourth example, ""lug"" alone gives a single ""blue.""
5. In the fifth example, ""lug"" after ""wif"" and before ""dax"" yields a single ""blue.""

Seeing this pattern, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue,"" irrespective of its position. There is no additional output or repetition effect observed with ""lug,"" unlike ""walm,"" which seems to produce repeated ""yellow"" outputs.

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,81,lug
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""lug"" seems to be related to the color ""blue."" Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue."" Here is a breakdown illustrating this observation:

- In the second example (dax bluf wif zup lug), ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the third example (wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug), both occurrences of ""lug"" correspond to ""blue.""
- In the fourth example (lug dax bluf), ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and so forth for the remaining example.

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,81,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" we must look at the pattern of the output colors in relation to the presence of ""lug"" in the input string:

- In the first example, ""lug"" precedes a sequence of ""walm"" which correspond with the repetition of the color yellow, but it starts with an instance of red (since ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which is yellow).
- In the second example, ""lug"" is followed by no additional words, and the output color is blue.
- In the third example, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm dax lug,"" and the corresponding colors are blue blue green blue. Here, ""lug"" is both preceded and followed by different colors.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" is the first word and the output color is blue; it is followed by ""dax"" which corresponds to green.
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" follows ""wif"" and ""zup"" and the output color is blue; it is followed by ""dax"" which corresponds to green.

Regardless of the other words in the input (such as ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" or ""walm""), ""dax"" always maps to ""green"" in the output. The other words correspond to different colors: ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" and ""walm"" to ""blue."" 

Rule:
dax -> green",1.0,81,dax
"Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

dax -> green",1.0,81,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" as it relates to output colors.

1. When ""dax"" appears alone as an input, the output is ""green"".
2. When ""dax"" is preceded by ""wif"", our output is ""red green"" - ""wif"" seems to be associated with red, and ""dax"" with green.
3. In the input ""wif dax zup wif"", we get ""red green yellow red"". So ""wif"" still corresponds to red, ""dax"" to green, and now we can infer that ""zup"" might correspond to yellow.
4. The input ""lug walm dax"" yields an output of ""blue blue blue green"". Thus, both ""lug"" and ""walm"" are associated with blue, while ""dax"" remains consistent with green.

So, considering all the examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".",1.0,81,dax
"Based on the presented examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" This can be deduced as every instance of the word ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the output.

However, the presence of other words also seems to have a correspondence to other colors: ""wif"" appears to be associated with the color ""red,"" as it appears in the input each time ""red"" appears in the output; similarly, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" and ""walm"" both correspond to ""blue."" 

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,81,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the input sequence. Other words in the sequence correspond to different colors; for example, ""wif"" corresponds to red and ""zup"" to yellow. ""lug"" and ""walm"" both correspond to blue. Each word is translated to its corresponding color, maintaining the sequence order in the output.",1.0,81,dax
"Based on the given examples, ""wif"" results in the output ""red"" consistently, regardless of the presence of other words. The word ""dax"" results in ""green"" and appears to maintain that meaning whether it is before or after ""wif"". Therefore, it seems that ""wif"" has a standalone meaning that is not influenced by the words around it.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,81,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in every example provided.",1.0,81,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that each nonce word (a made-up word with an assigned meaning) is consistently associated with a specific color. The repeated isolated use of ""wif"" leads to the output ""red,"" indicating a straightforward translation from this nonce word to the color.

The compound examples show ""wif"" combined with other nonce words such as ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" and ""zup."" These combinations lead to sequences of colors as outputs, suggesting that each of these nonce words also translates to a specific color.

Considering this, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" in these examples appears to be:

Rule: wif corresponds to the color red.

Thus, wif -> red",1.0,81,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following pattern for the word ""wif"" and the other nonce words:

1. When ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red"".
2. When ""wif"" is preceded by ""dax"", the output corresponding to ""wif"" is still ""red"" but ""dax"" produces ""green"".
3. If ""wif"" is in a sequence with ""dax"" appearing before and/or after it, ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" each time it appears.
4. The word ""lug"" produces ""blue"" and ""zup"" produces ""yellow"" when they precede ""dax"" or ""wif"".

Therefore, we can deduce a rule for ""wif"":

Rule: ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"", regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.",1.0,81,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following color associations:

- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""dax"" appears to translate to ""green.""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

These associations seem to follow a one-to-one mapping between the nonce words and the colors they represent. Therefore:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,81,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. In each instance, the position of ""zup"" within the input sequence does not appear to change its corresponding output. It consistently translates to yellow regardless of its position or the presence of other words.

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"".",1.0,81,zup

Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,81,zup

"Rule: bluf -> The color word preceding bluf, repeated twice.",1.0,81,bluf
"Based on the input and output examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to repeating the color word that comes just before it.

Here are the rules deduced from the examples:

1. ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue"" -> ""bluf"" results in the repetition of ""blue.""
2. ""dax zup bluf"" outputs ""green yellow yellow"" -> ""bluf"" results in the repetition of ""yellow.""
3. ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red"" -> ""bluf"" results in the repetition of ""red.""
4. ""lug wif lug bluf"" outputs ""blue red blue blue"" -> ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and results in ""blue"" being repeated.
5. ""dax lug bluf wif"" outputs ""green blue blue red"" -> ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" again and results in ""blue"" being repeated before ""wif"" changes the color to ""red.""

So the induction based on the given examples leads to the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color word immediately preceding it. If ""lug"" comes before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" means ""blue."" If ""wif"" comes before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" means ""red,"" and if ""zup"" comes before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" means ""yellow.""",1.0,81,bluf
"bluf -> the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" repeated twice.

Rule: When ""bluf"" is used, it takes the color word before it and doubles that color word in the output.",1.0,81,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color word before it.,1.0,81,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color word that appears immediately before bluf.,1.0,81,bluf
"Analyzing the given examples, it appears that the presence of the word ""walm"" in the input causes all the words preceding ""walm"" to produce the same output color. Here is how each example breaks down:

In the first example:
- ""wif walm dax"" all turn red, indicating ""walm"" causes ""wif"" to turn from its usual color to red.
- ""zup"" occurs both before and after ""walm"" and results in different colors (red before walm and yellow after), reinforcing the 'preceding words' rule.

In the second example:
- ""zup walm dax zup"" turns to yellow until ""walm"" while the second ""zup"" after ""walm"" remains yellow and ""dax"" turns green, indicating that the effect of ""walm"" does not extend to words after it.
- ""wif"" at the end of the string turns red, which is its typical color observed in the first example.

The third example:
- ""zup wif"" all turn red following the word ""walm"".

The fourth example:
- ""dax walm wif"" all turn green due to ""walm"".
- ""bluf"" turns red after ""walm"", so ""bluf"" is unaffected by ""walm"".

The fifth example:
- ""lug walm"" all turn blue, while ""wif"" turns red, which follows the established rule for ""wif"" outside the influence of ""walm"".
- The last ""lug"" remains blue, its original color unaffected by ""walm"".

From these examples, we can induce the rule that ""walm"" causes all words that precede it to change to the same color. However, this effect does not extend to words that follow ""walm"".

Rule: ""walm"" affects the color output of every word that precedes it in the sequence, making them all output the same color. The color chosen depends on the word ""walm""'s position; it doesn't follow a consistent color itself but affects preceding words.",0.9,81,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the inputs and outputs provided. Let's break down each example and identify the sequence of inputs that correspond to the sequence of outputs.

1. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
2. zup walm dax zup dax wif -> yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
3. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
4. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
5. lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue

Now let's analyze the patterns related to ""walm"" relative to the colors:

- In example 1, the word after ""walm"" (dax) corresponds to the color green, and the color red appears three times, followed by the color green which is after ""walm"" and yellow after that. 
- In example 2, ""walm"" again precedes the word ""dax,"" and its corresponding color is again green, with preceding words corresponding to the color yellow repeated thrice.
- In example 3, ""walm"" is the last word, and it's preceded by ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, which is repeated three times.
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, and precedes ""wif"" which corresponds to red and there is an additional ""red"" for ""bluf.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, and the color pattern again repeats three times before changing to red.

The common pattern here is that each time ""walm"" is mentioned, the word immediately following it corresponds to the color that is represented three times in the sequence, which suggests that ""walm"" may relate to repetition. However, it seems to be interrupting this pattern to include the word following it and then switches to the color red before continuing with the next color or pattern. Since the red color appears consistently after the sequence of three identical colors, it could indicate that ""walm"" represents a transition point or signifies change when followed by a different word.

Based on the examples given, it seems that ""walm"" represents a rule where it causes the next word's corresponding color to repeat three times and then switches to the color red before continuing. To check this, we could look to see if ""walm"" is always followed by a new color which appears three times followed by a red.

Let's formulate this as a rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the next word to repeat three times followed by the color red.",0.8,81,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the word that immediately follows it. 

For example:
- In ""wif walm dax zup,"" walm repeats the color of dax, which is red.
- In ""zup walm dax zup dax wif,"" walm repeats the color of the following word dax, which is yellow.
- In ""zup wif walm,"" walm takes the color of wif, which is red.
- In ""dax walm wif bluf,"" walm takes the color of wif, which is green.
- In ""lug walm wif lug,"" walm takes the color of wif, which is blue.",0.8,81,walm
"To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns of inputs and corresponding output colors.

From the examples given, it seems that when ""walm"" is present, the word immediately prior to ""walm"" specifies a color pattern. After ""walm,"" all the words repeat the same color pattern until a new word is introduced, which breaks the pattern. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""wif walm dax zup""
   Output: red red red green yellow
   Rule: ""wif"" establishes red, ""walm"" continues with red, ""dax"" is green, breaking the pattern, and ""zup"" is yellow.

2. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif""
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   Rule: ""zup"" establishes yellow, ""walm"" continues with yellow, ""dax"" is green, and then ""zup"" follows the pattern established by ""dax."" ""wif"" is red.

3. ""zup wif walm""
   Output: yellow red red red
   Rule: ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" establishes red, and ""walm"" continues with red.

4. ""dax walm wif bluf""
   Output: green green green red red
   Rule: ""dax"" establishes green, ""walm"" continues with green, and ""wif"" is red, which then is followed by ""bluf"" which continues the red.

5. ""lug walm wif lug""
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   Rule: ""lug"" establishes blue, ""walm"" continues with blue, ""wif"" is red, and ""lug"" resumes with blue.

With this pattern in mind, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it sustains the color pattern of the preceding word until a new word breaks the pattern. 

Rule: walm -> sustains the color initiated by the previous word until a new color is established.",0.8,81,walm
"To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the corresponding colors in the output:

Example 1:
""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""
Here, ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Example 2:
""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red""
""Walm"" in this sequence also corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" but something is changing, as the sequence starts and ends with ""yellow,"" yet ""walm"" is associated with ""yellow"" the first time it is used.

Example 3:
""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
""Walm"" corresponds to ""red"" again.

Example 4:
""dax walm wif bluf"" -> ""green green green red red""
""Walm"" corresponds to ""green"" in this instance.

Example 5:
""lug walm wif lug"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue""
Here, ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue.""

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule: The word ""walm"" seems to take on the color of the word preceding it, as the output color for ""walm"" matches the color of the word before it in each sequence. However, there is an exception in the first example, where there is no word before ""walm,"" yet the output is ""red."" It could be that the default color for ""walm"" is ""red,"" or it might be context-dependent and require more examples to fully understand.

Rule: ""walm"" -> takes the color of the word before it in the sequence, with a possible default of ""red"" when it is the first word.",0.8,81,walm
"Observing the inputs and their associated outputs, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". To further validate this conclusion, let's examine the role of ""lug"" in each example:

- In the first input, ""lug"" is directly followed by a color output ""blue.""
- In all cases, regardless of the position of ""lug"" in the sequence (beginning, middle, end), it consistently maps to the color ""blue.""

Even though the other words also seem to map to certain colors, we are focusing on the word ""lug."" Based on the examples given, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,82,lug
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to determine the meaning or rule behind the word ""lug"" by looking at the patterns before and after it appears and the corresponding outputs.

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
- ""lug"" appears after ""dax"" and the output is ""blue.""

Input: dax lug zup
Output: green blue yellow
- Again, ""lug"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""green blue.""

Input: dax lug bluf wif
Output: green blue blue red
- ""lug"" follows ""dax"" and the output remains ""blue.""

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue
- ""lug"" stands alone at the beginning and the output is ""blue."" It also appears at the end with a previously determined word ""wif"" corresponding to ""red."" The output is still ""blue"" before ""wif.""

Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
- ""lug"" appears after ""zup"" and the output is ""blue.""

In each case, regardless of where ""lug"" appears or what words are around it, the output is consistently ""blue."" Therefore, we can induce that ""lug"" is directly associated with the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,82,lug
"In order to deduce the meaning of the word ""lug,"" we will analyze the received input and output data.

In each example, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the ""blue"" in the output. Let's see if this holds true for each case.

1. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

2. Input: dax lug zup
   Output: green blue yellow
   In this case, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" again.

3. Input: dax lug bluf wif
   Output: green blue blue red
   Yet again ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

4. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue 
   Here ""lug"" appears twice and in both instances, it corresponds to ""blue.""

5. Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
   Once more, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Based on these observations, it appears that the rule is consistent:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,82,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" we should look at the relationship between the input and the output in each example.

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""walm"" translates to ""blue""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""

Input: dax lug zup
Output: green blue yellow
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""

Input: dax lug bluf wif
Output: green blue blue red
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""blue""

- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""blue""
- ""zup"" again translates to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" again translates to ""yellow"" (Note: here ""bluf"" is inconsistent, as previously it was translated to ""blue"")
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""

From the examples provided, it consistently appears that 'lug' translates to 'blue'.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,82,lug
"Based on the patterns observed in the input and their corresponding outputs, we can deduce the following:

- The word ""dax"" consistently leads to the output ""green.""
- The word ""zup"" consistently leads to the output ""yellow.""
- The word ""walm"" consistently leads to the output ""blue.""
- The word ""bluf"" consistently leads to the output ""blue.""
- The word ""wif"" consistently leads to the output ""red.""
  
When ""lug"" appears, the following output color is ""blue,"" except when ""wif"" directly follows ""lug,"" in which case the output for ""wif"" is ""red."" This pattern allows us to deduce the meaning of ""lug"" in this context.

Therefore, based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the output color ""blue,"" unless directly followed by the word ""wif,"" in which case the word after ""lug"" keeps its corresponding color. However, since ""wif"" always outputs red, it does not serve as a definitive rule for interaction as ""wif"" outputs red whether it follows ""lug"" or not.

Hence, the simplest rule for ""lug"" is:

lug -> blue",1.0,82,lug
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. It maintains this meaning regardless of its position in the string of words.

- In the second example, ""dax"" on its own translates to ""green.""
- In the third example, ""zup dax"" translates to ""yellow green,"" providing further evidence that ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""

"Based on the examples provided, each instance of the word ""bluf"" results in the word ""red"" being replaced with ""green"" in the corresponding output. In instances where ""bluf"" is present, the existing pattern of colors (red, yellow, green) is altered by replacing ""red"" with ""green"". Here is the analysis:

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
Analysis: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and we have ""bluf"" immediately after. Since the output is ""red red"", it suggests that ""bluf"" means ""red"" in this instance, but it's not enough information on its own.

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green
Analysis: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". Based on the previous example, ""bluf"" seems to operate as a color, and since ""dax"" produces ""green"" in the third position, we can deduce that ""bluf"" resulted in ""yellow"" instead of what might have been expected based on other inputs.

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green
Analysis: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green"". Here ""bluf"" is at the end and results in ""green"" again, consistent with the idea that it could represent ""green"" or trigger ""green"" to appear.

Input: wif zup dax bluf
Output: red yellow green green
Analysis: ""wif"" correlates with ""red"", ""zup"" with ""yellow"", and ""dax"" with ""green"". By having ""bluf"" at the end and seeing an extra ""green"", it reinforces the idea that ""bluf"" relates to the color ""green"".

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
Analysis: This is the same as the first input, and the output is again ""red red"". However, given the additional examples, the presence of ""bluf"" doesn't affect the output here, which is contradictory to the observed pattern in other inputs.

Given the information from the other inputs, we could surmise that the meaning of ""bluf"" might be contextually dependent. But there is an inconsistency: In most cases, it corresponds to an additional ""green"" being present in the output, but not in the case of ""wif bluf"" input-output pairs. However, considering the examples where ""bluf"" is followed by or precedes another color word, the most consistent rule appears to be:

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a color word, replace that color with ""green"" in the output; except when ""bluf"" follows the color word corresponding to ""red,"" in which case, repeat ""red"" in the output.

This rule aligns with all provided examples except for the ""wif bluf"" case, which seems to present an exception or signifies that ""bluf"" may have multiple potential meanings or effects dependent on other, not yet identified, contextual factors.",0.2,82,bluf
"Walm appears to correspond to a rule related to the color mentioned before it, with that color being repeated three times in sequence.

The repetition appears regardless of the word following ""walm,"" which could be a single color or represent the starting of a new sequence.

"Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to result in a repetition of the color associated with the word directly preceding it. The rule is as follows:

1. ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
2. ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
3. ""wif"" corresponds to red.
4. ""dax"" introduces a new color that does not repeat, corresponding to green.

When ""walm"" follows these words, the color associated with the previous word is repeated multiple times, except when ""dax"" is involved, as ""dax"" is followed by a singular non-repeated green.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated in the output for the length of the input minus one (except when following ""dax"", which results in green).",1.0,82,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the consistent patterns in the examples given:

- Whenever ""lug"" appears, the output contains ""blue,"" regardless of the presence of ""walm.""
- Whenever ""zup"" appears, the output contains ""yellow,"" again regardless of the presence of ""walm.""
- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output contains ""red,"" regardless of the presence of ""walm.""
- ""Dax"" seems to be correlated with ""green,"" but only in the presence of ""walm.""

By examining the changes in the output, we can establish that ""walm"" influences the recurring color pattern in the output and is associated with multiple instances of the same color. However, the color that becomes repetitive is determined by another word in the input.

From the input examples and the corresponding outputs, it appears that ""walm"" takes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it and repeats that color three times in the output. If ""walm"" follows more than two words, it extends the color pattern of the last word preceding it to two additional occurrences. 

Rule: walm -> ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated for a total of three occurrences in the output. If there is no preceding word, then the color associated with ""walm"" itself is yellow, as seen in the example ""zup walm.""",0.9,82,walm

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,83,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided. We need to correlate instances of the word ""dax"" with the corresponding parts of the output.

1. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   
2. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   
3. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue
   
4. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   
5. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue

Let us analyze the occurrences of ""dax"":

- The second color in Outputs 1 and 2 (""red"") is consistent with the presence of ""wif"" in the inputs just following ""dax"" and ""zup,"" respectively. This indicates that ""dax"" itself likely translates to ""green"" in these scenarios, as it precedes ""green"" directly in the output.

- In Outputs 3 and 5, the first color is ""green"" and corresponds directly to the occurrence of ""dax"" at the beginning of the input. This supports the idea that ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

- In Output 4, the sequence ""dax walm wif"" outputs to ""green green green red."" Assuming ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" it appears ""walm"" must also translate to ""green.""

Based on the evidence provided, it seems that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" 

Thus, the rule we can deduce is:
Rule: dax -> green",1.0,83,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that each unique word translates to a specific color. The word 'wif' consistently translates to 'red' in every example given. Here is the breakdown of the other words:

Hence, the rule can be stated as:

"Based on the examples provided, we're trying to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""zup."" Let's look at each example and its output:

1. Input: zup

   - This example implies that ""zup"" could mean ""yellow"" since it's a direct one-to-one relationship.

2. Input: dax wif zup
   Output: green red yellow
   - In this example, three different words result in three different colors. ""zup"" still results in ""yellow,"" while ""dax"" and ""wif"" produce ""green"" and ""red,"" respectively.

3. Input: zup dax
   Output: yellow green
   - The word order has changed, but ""zup"" still produces ""yellow"" and ""dax"" produces ""green.""

4. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   - We see that ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax"" have retained their assigned colors from the previous examples. ""walm"" seems to produce multiple greens, possibly indicating repetition of the color ""green.""

5. Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
   - ""wif"" is still ""red,"" and ""zup"" is still ""yellow,"" with ""dax"" being ""green."" ""bluf"" appears twice and corresponds to two occurrences of ""blue."" This suggests that words maintain their color associations, and repeated words in input result in repeated color outputs.

Based on these observations, we can confidently deduce the following:

zup -> meaning ""yellow""

Rule: Each nonce word consistently translates to a specific color, and repeated words result in repeated color outputs.",1.0,83,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Each input example that contains the word ""zup"" results in the word ""yellow"" appearing in the output in the same position relative to the other colors. There is no indication that the meaning of ""zup"" changes based on context or position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule we can deduce for ""zup"" is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,83,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns in each input-output pair.

1. 'zup lug zup bluf lug' -> 'yellow blue yellow yellow blue'
Here, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', 'lug' to 'blue', and 'bluf' appears to correspond to 'yellow'.

2. 'wif bluf dax' -> 'red red green'
'wif' corresponds to 'red', 'dax' corresponds to 'green', and 'bluf' appears to correspond to 'red'.

3. 'zup bluf wif bluf' -> 'yellow yellow red red'
'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and 'bluf' seems to correspond to 'red' again.

4. 'wif dax zup wif dax bluf' -> 'red green yellow red green green'
'wif' corresponds to 'red', 'dax' to 'green', 'zup' to 'yellow'. The word 'bluf' at the end corresponds to 'green'.

5. 'wif lug zup bluf' -> 'red blue yellow yellow'
'wif' corresponds to 'red', 'lug' to 'blue', 'zup' to 'yellow', and 'bluf' once again appears to correspond to 'yellow'.

Given these examples, it's clear there is not a straightforward one-to-one correspondence between 'bluf' and a specific color. Instead, the meaning of 'bluf' appears to depend on its position or the words that are around it.

Let's look at the patterns:

- When 'bluf' follows 'zup', the color is 'yellow' (Examples 1 & 5).
- When 'bluf' follows 'wif', the color is 'red' (Examples 3 & 5).
- When 'bluf' follows 'dax', the color is 'green' (Example 4).

So, the rule seems to be that the word 'bluf' takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> The word 'bluf' takes the color of the preceding word in the sequence.",1.0,83,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"", let's analyze each example and look for patterns, paying special attention to the outputs that correspond to ""bluf"":

Example 1: zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
Example 2: wif bluf dax -> red red green
Example 3: zup bluf wif bluf -> yellow yellow red red
Example 4: wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> red green yellow red green green
Example 5: wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow

By rule induction, we can see that the word ""bluf"" always corresponds to the color right before it being repeated. If we write it down separately for clarity:

Input sequence: zup lug zup bluf lug
Colors:        yellow blue yellow yellow blue
                                ^

Input sequence: wif bluf dax
Colors:        red red green
                      ^

Input sequence: zup bluf wif bluf
Colors:        yellow yellow red red
                      ^       ^

Input sequence: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Colors:        red green yellow red green green
                                               ^

Input sequence: wif lug zup bluf
Colors:        red blue yellow yellow
                               ^

In every case, ""bluf"" corresponds to a repetition of the color word that precedes it. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it represents a repeat of the previous color word in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat of the previous color word in the sequence.",1.0,83,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> yellow when following zup or lug, otherwise green.",0.8,83,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following rules for the words:

- When ""zup"" occurs, the output is ""yellow"".
- When ""lug"" occurs, the output is ""blue"".
- When ""wif"" occurs, the output is ""red"".
- When ""dax"" occurs, the output is ""green"".

Considering these rules, let's look at what output ""bluf"" triggers:

1. In the first input, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"", and the output is ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue"". Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""bluf"" in this context results in ""yellow"".

2. In the second input, ""bluf"" precedes ""dax"", and the output is ""red red green"". The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", so ""bluf"" in this context also results in ""red"".

3. In the third input, ""bluf"" occurs twice and each time is followed by the same color ""yellow red red red"", suggesting that ""bluf"" matches the color that follows it, since ""wif"" is clearly established as ""red"".

4. In the fourth input, ""bluf"" occurs last after a sequence of other established words, resulting in ""red green yellow red green green"". The pre-established word ""wif"" outputs ""red"", and ""dax"" outputs ""green"", so ""bluf"" in this context results in ""green"".

5. In the fifth input, ""bluf"" is followed by no other words, but the preceding words set a pattern of ""red blue yellow"", and the output for ""bluf"" appears to be ""yellow"" in this case.

Given the above information, it seems that ""bluf"" changes its output depending on some contextual rule which is not consistent across all examples. However, looking carefully, we see that ""bluf"" always results in the color of the word that follows it (in the third example it’s ""red"", which follows ""bluf""), except when it is led by ""zup"" where it results in ""yellow"", but this exception may also be due to the fact that ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" AND followed by ""lug"", which might differentiate the scenario from the other provided examples.

Thus, based on the provided context, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes on the color of the next word, with a conditional alteration when preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""lug"".

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word that follows it, with potential exceptions based on context.",0.8,83,bluf
"Based on the pattern in the examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds with ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup"" but turns into ""red"" when preceded by ""wif."" There doesn't seem to be enough information to conclude how ""bluf"" behaves when followed by other nonce words or in different positions, such as when it follows ""dax"" because that particular example is not given. Here is the induction from the examples provided:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" corresponds with ""yellow yellow,"" whereas ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue."" 
- In the second example, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" and results in ""red.""
- The third example further supports that ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow"" and that when ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red.""
- The fourth example does not give us direct information about ""bluf"" since it follows a sequence that isn't found elsewhere (it follows ""dax""), but assuming the pattern holds, it's reasonable to infer that ""bluf"" might here translate to ""green"" by association with ""wif dax"" resulting in ""red green."" 
- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""zup bluf"" once again yields ""yellow yellow,"" supporting the earlier observations.

Rule: When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the result is ""yellow."" When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the result is ""red."" There isn't enough information to deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" following ""dax"" with certainty, but it might be ""green"" based on the related patterns.

bluf -> ""yellow"" after ""zup"", ""red"" after ""wif"", and potentially ""green"" following ""dax"" when preceded by ""wif.""",0.8,83,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine its correlation with the output colors in each example.

In Example 1, we have ""walm zup"" which results in ""green yellow.""
In Example 2, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green.""
In Example 3, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow.""
In Example 4, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow.""
In Example 5, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red.""

Observing these patterns, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the preceding color. Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the word before walm.

Rule: If [word] is followed by ""walm"", then the output color for ""walm"" will be the same as the output color for [word].",1.0,83,walm
"walm -> meaning. Based on the contextual information given in the examples, the meaning of the word ""walm"" can be deduced by comparing the outputs to their corresponding inputs. In every case, the output for ""walm"" is ""green"" unless it immediately follows the word ""dax,"" in which case the output is ""red."" 

Rule: If ""walm"" follows any word other than ""dax,"" the color is green. If ""walm"" immediately follows ""dax,"" the color is red.",1.0,83,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to cause the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately preceded it. Here’s how we can break it down:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green"", so ""walm"" repeats the color ""green"" from ""dax"".
- In the second example, ""walm wif dax"" corresponds to ""green green red green"", so ""walm"" again repeats the color that precedes it which is ""green"" from ""wif"".
- In the third example, ""zup walm wif"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"", so ""walm"" repeats the ""yellow"" from ""zup"".
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm lug zup"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow blue yellow"", so ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" from ""zup"".
- In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red"", so ""walm"" repeats ""red"" from ""wif"".

Considering the pattern, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it in the sequence.",1.0,83,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to compare the input and the outputs carefully to discern patterns related to ""walm."" Given the examples:

1. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
2. dax walm wif dax -> green green green red green
3. wif lug zup walm wif lug -> red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
4. zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
5. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red

From the examples above, we can try to identify what color ""walm"" corresponds to in the output by looking at its position in the input and the resulting color in the output:

- In example 1, after ""walm"" we see ""green green"" in the output, implying ""walm"" might mean ""green.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" is followed by ""green"" again.
- In example 3, ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow,"" but it's noteworthy that every word after ""walm"" has the same color ""yellow.""
- In example 4, ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow"" again in the output, reinforcing the pattern that ""walm"" results in repetition of the same color.
- In example 5, after ""walm,"" we notice ""red red,"" again implying that ""walm"" induces repetition of a color.

Based on the patterns, the word ""walm"" appears to indicate repetition of the color corresponding to the word that follows it in the sequence. If there is no color change after ""walm,"" it repeats the color of the word immediately following ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the next word to repeat.",0.8,83,walm
"From the examples provided, we can induce the following pattern:

1. In the first example, after ""walm"" all words translate to the color ""green"" until a word is followed by ""zup"", which translates to ""yellow"".
2. In the second example, it follows the same rule where after ""walm"" all the words translate to ""green"".
3. In the third example, after ""walm"", ""wif lug"" translates to ""yellow red blue"", which does not include ""green"", so this may introduce a condition where ""walm"" changes the subsequent words only until a certain point.
4. In the fourth example, after ""walm"", the word ""lug"" translates to ""yellow"", opposing the rule we saw in points 1 and 2 where it should have translated to ""green"". After this instance of ""lug"", ""zup"" comes up again and translates to ""yellow"" and then ""wif dax"" to ""red green"", indicating that the effect of ""walm"" stops before ""lug"".
5. In the fifth example, after ""walm"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"", following the same discontinuation of the ""green"" effect seen in example four.

Analyzing these points, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" makes all following words translate to ""green"" until a word that is not ""dax"" or ""walm"" is encountered. Therefore, the introduction of ""walm"" changes the output of subsequent words to ""green"" until a word differing from ""dax"" (which translates to ""green"" on its own) or ""walm"" is encountered. Once such a word is encountered, the sequence after ""walm"" returns to its original color translations.

- Even when ""dax"" is not the last word (as in ""dax zup"" and ""dax wif bluf""), it still translates to ""green"" in the output.

It's also worth noting the correspondence of other words to colors might influence this deduction, but because we're solely interested in the meaning of ""dax,"" the other word-to-color mappings are not as critical for this specific rule induction.

Thus, it's reasonable to deduce that ""wif"" is associated with the output ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,84,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can infer the following rules concerning the nonce word ""wif"" and the corresponding outputs:

1. Whenever ""wif"" appears, it is followed by the output ""red"".
2. Other words seem to correspond to other colors; for example, ""dax"" is always followed by the output ""green"".
3. The word ""bluf"" also appears to correspond to the output ""red"".

Given the above observations, we could deduce the following rule for the meaning of ""wif"":

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,84,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Here's the breakdown of the examples:

1. ""wif bluf dax walm"" corresponds to ""red red green green green"". The second word ""bluf"" must also mean red because it translates to the same color as ""wif"". The third word, ""dax,"" translates to green, as does the fifth word, ""walm.""

2. In ""lug dax bluf wif dax,"" the output is ""blue green green red green."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""dax"" to green, ""bluf"" to green (note that based on the first example, this is inconsistent, so there might be additional context-dependent rules not discernible from the provided examples), ""wif"" to red, and ""dax"" again to green.

3. ""wif dax"" corresponds to ""red green,"" which supports the previous assignments of ""wif"" to red and ""dax"" to green.

4. and 5. The single input ""wif"" in both the fourth and fifth examples yields the single output ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red

However, given that there seems to be an inconsistency with the word ""bluf"" in the examples (it is translated as both red and green), it is important to note that the examples provided may lack context or contain errors, or there might be more complex rules governing these translations that are not explained here. Without additional information, the simplest conclusion is that ""wif"" stands for red.",0.9,84,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,84,zup

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.",1.0,84,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow in the provided examples.",1.0,84,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Each time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow"", regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,84,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,84,zup
"From the examples provided, we can observe that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. Following this, we can establish that 'dax' corresponds to 'green', 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'. 

Now, by comparing each input with its output, let's try to deduce the meaning or rule for 'bluf':

- In the first example, 'bluf' is followed by no words, and the output is 'red red'. Since 'wif' corresponds to 'red' and 'wif' is before 'bluf', this could suggest that 'bluf' implies repeating the color before it.
- In the second example, 'bluf' follows 'dax', and the output for 'bluf' is 'green', which is the same as the color associated with 'dax'.
- In the third example, 'bluf' follows 'lug', and the output for 'bluf' is 'blue', which is the same as the color for 'lug'.
- In the fourth example, 'bluf' follows 'wif', and the output is 'red red', indicating the same repetition pattern.
- Finally, in the fifth example, 'bluf' follows 'zup', and the output is 'yellow yellow', confirming the rule that 'bluf' causes a repetition of the previous word's corresponding color.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. 'Bluf' means to repeat the color of the word immediately before it.",1.0,84,bluf
"Through analyzing the provided examples, we can create a correspondence between the nonces and the colors:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue

Now, we need to discern what ""bluf"" signifies. Here is what we observe from the examples:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" (red), and the output for ""bluf"" is two reds.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" occurs after ""dax"" (green), and the output for ""bluf"" is a repetition of the last color mentioned before ""bluf"", which in this case is green.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" (blue), and the output for ""bluf"" is again a repetition of the last color, here, blue.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" (red), and the output for ""bluf"" replicates the prior color red.
- In the fifth and last given example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), and the output for ""bluf"" repeats the previous color, which is yellow.

From these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" means to repeat the previous color mentioned in the sequence.

Thus, bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the repetition of the previous color mentioned before ""bluf"".",1.0,84,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at the patterns of association between the input and output in each example. 

In the first example, when ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" the corresponding output is ""red red."" From this, one might initially think that ""bluf"" translates to ""red,"" but additional examples must be considered.

In the second example, we have ""dax bluf zup"" corresponding to ""green green yellow."" Since ""dax"" on its own translates to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" it appears that ""bluf"" here again translates to ""green."" However, ""bluf"" following ""dax"" results in the same color as ""dax,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" might repeat the color of the preceding word.

The third example, ""dax lug bluf,"" and its output ""green blue blue"" strengthen the idea that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word immediately before it. Here, ""lug"" produces ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" also produces ""blue.""

In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax"" leads to ""red red green."" Again, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red,"" just like the color of ""wif.""

The fifth example has ""dax zup lug zup bluf,"" with the output ""green yellow blue yellow yellow."" The word ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce the rule for the word ""bluf"" in these examples:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Hence, bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",1.0,84,bluf
"Analyzing the given examples:

1. zup dax zup dax wif bluf -> yellow green yellow green red red
2. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
3. dax lug bluf -> green blue blue
4. wif bluf dax -> red red green
5. dax zup lug zup bluf -> green yellow blue yellow yellow

To deduce the rule for 'bluf', let's analyze each case:

- In example 1, 'bluf' follows 'wif' and the colors turn out to be 'red red', which implies 'bluf' could potentially mean repeating the color of the word before it ('wif' correlates to 'red').
- In example 2, 'bluf' follows 'dax' which correlates to 'green', and the output is 'green green'. This supports the earlier conclusion as it repeats the color 'green' which is associated with 'dax'.
- In example 3, 'bluf' follows 'lug' which correlates to 'blue', and the output is 'blue blue', further supporting the conclusion that 'bluf' means repeat the color of the previous word.
- In example 4, 'bluf' again follows 'wif' (correlated with 'red'), and the output is 'red red', consistent with previous examples.
- In example 5, 'bluf' follows 'zup lug zup', with 'zup' correlating to 'yellow' and 'lug' to 'blue', and the output is 'green yellow blue yellow yellow', showing once more that 'bluf' causes the repetition of the color before it ('yellow' in this case).

Based on the input-output correlation, 'bluf' seems to mean 'repeat the color of the word before bluf.'

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.",1.0,84,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the word before bluf.,1.0,84,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns associated with the word's occurrence in the given examples:

1. In the first example, ""dax walm zup"" translates to ""green green green yellow."" Since ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" it appears that ""walm"" does not change the color associated with ""dax,"" as both instances translate to ""green."" 

2. In the second example, ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue blue blue green red red green."" Here we see that after ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" repeats. The word ""walm"" appears right before ""dax,"" which is translated to ""green,"" yet the coloring for ""walm"" is ""blue"" in this instance, not ""green"" like ""dax.""

3. In the third example, ""dax zup dax walm"" translates to ""green yellow green green green."" Here, ""walm"" is following ""dax"" and translates to ""green,"" which is identical to the color associated with ""dax.""

4. In the fourth example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" translated to ""blue,"" and maintains that color.

5. In the fifth example, ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" Here ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" takes on the color ""red,"" not ""yellow"" from ""zup.""

Given these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word immediately before it.",1.0,84,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the output colors corresponding to each appearance of ""walm"" in the examples.

1. In ""dax walm zup,"" ""walm"" is followed by a yellow, while both ""dax"" and ""zup"" are green.
2. In ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax,"" the word after ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which is green; however, ""walm"" itself is followed by three blues.
3. In ""dax zup dax walm,"" the ""walm"" is at the end and is followed by three greens.
4. In ""lug walm,"" the word ""walm"" is also followed by two blues.
5. In ""zup wif walm,"" the word ""walm"" is followed by three reds.

From these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Whenever ""walm"" appears, the output color matches the number of letters in the previous word, with green corresponding to three letters, blue to four letters, and red to five letters. ""Dax"" and ""zup"" each have three letters (green), ""lug"" has four (blue), and ""wif"" has five (red). ""Walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the length of the word preceding it for as many letters as are in the word ""walm"" (which has four letters).

Rule: walm -> repeats the color based on the number of letters in the previous word (three letters yield green, four letters yield blue, and five letters yield red), with the number of repetitions matching the number of letters in ""walm"" (four).",1.0,84,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the meaning of 'walm' corresponds to the color repetition of the immediately preceding word. Here is the pattern observed:

- When 'walm' follows 'dax', 'green' is repeated.
- When 'walm' follows 'lug', 'blue' is repeated.
- When 'walm' follows 'zup', 'yellow' is repeated.
- When 'walm' follows 'wif', 'red' is repeated.

Therefore, the rule for 'walm' seems to be to repeat the color associated with the previous word as follows:

walm -> Meaning: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule:
If 'walm' follows 'dax', the output is 'green green'.
If 'walm' follows 'lug', the output is 'blue blue'.
If 'walm' follows 'zup', the output is 'yellow yellow'.
If 'walm' follows 'wif', the output is 'red red'.",1.0,84,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns that correspond to the colors in the outputs.

In the first example, ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" as ""dax zup dax"" matches with ""green yellow green.""

However, in the second example, ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue,"" as does ""lug,"" and we see that ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""

In the third example, ""walm"" again corresponds to ""green,"" as the final three ""dax"" correspond with three ""green.""

In the fourth example, ""lug walm"" contributes to ""blue blue blue,"" which again ties ""walm"" to ""blue.""

Lastly, ""zup wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" in this instance corresponds to ""red.""

In this case, ""walm"" doesn't appear to correspond just to a single color but seems to adopt the color of the adjacent word, or possibly the word that precedes it, since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" after ""zup"" is ""red.""

Rule: walm -> takes on the color value of the preceding word. If ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it is green. If ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it is blue. If ""walm"" follows ""zup wif,"" it is red. If there is no preceding word (or no recognized conditioning rule for the preceding context), assume the default color for ""walm"" might be yellow, as seen in the first example.",0.9,84,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we must examine its corresponding output colors in each example:

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow
- Here, both ""dax"" and ""walm"" lead to the output ""green."" Since ""dax"" appears to consistently map to ""green"" in other inputs, any unique contribution of ""walm"" to the output is not clear.

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
- ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" but ""walm"" is followed by three ""blue"" as well. This might happen if ""walm"" also means ""repeat the previous color.""

Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green
- Here again, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green"" following ""walm,"" consistent with repetition of the previous color.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to repeat this color again.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- ""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" gives ""red."" Here, ""walm"" results in additional ""red,"" suggesting once more that ""walm"" repeats the color before it.

From these inputs and outputs, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes a repetition of the color resulting from the previous word:

"Based on the examples provided, where the input contains various combinations of words including ""dax"" and the output is a sequence of colors, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""dax.""

Input: dax
Output: green

This example directly correlates ""dax"" with the color green.

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

In this string, each word seems to correspond to a color. Since ""dax"" appears last and the last color is green, this supports the initial finding that ""dax"" means green.

Input: zup dax lug dax
Output: yellow green blue green

Again, ""dax"" is mapped to the color green both times it appears in the sequence.

Input: dax lug zup
Output: green blue yellow

Following the pattern, ""dax"" corresponds to the first color, which is green.

Input: dax
Output: green

This final example reaffirms the direct mapping of ""dax"" to green without any additional context.

Additionally, the other words in the input appear to be associated with their own colors as well; for example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" 

The examples also indicate that the order of words in the input matters for the order of colors in the output. When ""wif"" comes before ""zup,"" the output is ""red yellow,"" and when ""wif"" comes after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow red."" The same rule applies for all words; their corresponding colors appear in the same order as the words in the input.

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" can be defined as follows:

- In example 2, ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeated four times maps to ""green green green green."" Since ""zup"" is the first word and the first color in the output is ""yellow,"" this further supports the assumption that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" in this context appears to be fairly straightforward:

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,85,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the examples and look for patterns that can help us identify what rule or rules apply to ""bluf.""

From the examples given:

1. dax wif bluf -> green red red
2. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
3. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue
4. lug wif lug dax bluf -> blue red blue green green
5. wif bluf lug dax wif -> red red blue green red

We can observe the following patterns:

- Whenever ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- Whenever ""bluf"" is preceded by a word that is not ""wif,"" the output is the same color as the previous word.
- The examples given do not show ""bluf"" not being preceded by any word, so the rule is consistent in the context of the examples.

Based on this, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a word, its corresponding color is ""red"" if the preceding word is ""wif."" If the preceding word is a different word, then the color corresponding to ""bluf"" is the same as the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word.

Therefore:

bluf -> The color assigned to ""bluf"" depends on the preceding word; ""red"" if preceded by ""wif,"" otherwise it takes the color of the word before it.",1.0,85,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the output is a sequence of colors corresponding to each word in the input. Given that ""bluf"" consistently results in the color ""red,"" we can determine the meaning of ""bluf"" as follows:

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,85,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,1.0,85,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe that the word ""bluf"" is associated with output that is a color repeated twice. It can be noted that ""bluf"" might not represent a specific color, but rather a rule that duplicates the color of the word that comes right before it.

Analyzing the patterns:
- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" corresponds to red repeated twice.
- In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""bluf"" corresponds to red repeated twice.
- In the third example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and when ""bluf"" is used after ""lug,"" it corresponds to blue repeated twice.
- In the fourth example, the same rule applies with ""lug"" leading to blue and ""dax"" leading to green, with ""bluf"" doubling the color that precedes it (green in this case).
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" leads to blue, ""dax"" leads to green, and ""bluf"" seems to double the color red, which corresponds to ""wif.""

A consistent observation is that the word ""bluf"" doubles the last color mentioned. However, without a clear pattern for the colors corresponding to ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif,"" we cannot ascertain if ""bluf"" specifically doubles the color of the word right before it, or if ""red"" is a default for a specific condition.

Hence, the rule appears to be:

- In the third example, ""dax"" which is ""green"", is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""green"" three times.
- The fourth example supports this as well, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and the color ""green"" is repeated three times for each occurrence of ""walm"".
- The fifth example also follows the rule with ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" resulting in ""green"" three times.

Rule:
Walm -> Repeat the preceding color word in the output three times.",1.0,85,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the given examples, let's first look at the patterns for each of the other words and their respective outputs:

1. lug -> blue
2. wif -> red
3. dax -> green
4. zup -> yellow

These words output a consistent color regardless of their position (lug is always blue, wif is always red, etc.). However, ""walm"" does not have a consistent single-word output. Instead, ""walm"" is followed by multiple repetitions of another color dependent on the pattern of words preceding it. Let's look at the number of repetitions for walm in each example:

- In the first example ""lug walm"", we have two instances of ""blue"" from ""lug"" followed by three instances of ""blue"".
- In the second example identical to the first, the output is also the same, reaffirming the pattern.
- In the third example ""wif bluf dax walm"", there's ""red red green"", followed by three ""green"".
- In the fourth example, after ""dax walm"" it repeats ""green green green"", following a single ""green"" from ""dax"".
- In the fifth example, ""lug wif dax walm zup"" translates to ""blue red green green green yellow"", where after ""dax"" (green) we see three additional ""green"".

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the next word's color to be repeated three times. However, there is no next word after ""walm"" in the first, second, and fourth examples, indicating that ""walm"" repeats the previous color, not the next one.

Rule: ""walm"" -> triples the last color mentioned before it.

So, when we see ""walm"" in the list of words, we can expect the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three more times.",1.0,85,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond to the word ""green"" repeated a number of times based on the immediate word preceding ""walm."" Here's a breakdown of the instances:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" probably means ""blue,"" and ""walm"" is repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" leads to ""red red green green green,"" telling us ""wif"" means ""red,"" and ""bluf"" appears to be a mistake and should be ""lug"" based on the pattern from the other examples (meaning ""blue""), and ""dax"" means ""green."" Since ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" which is related to ""green,"" ""walm"" is repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" results in ""green green green red blue green green green,"" which supports the established meanings and indicates that ""walm"" after ""wif"" (red) is once and after ""dax"" (green) is three times.
- The fifth example, ""lug wif dax walm zup"" yielding ""blue red green green green yellow,"" again supports the rule, where ""lug"" means ""blue,"" ""wif"" means ""red,"" and ""dax"" means ""green."" The ""walm"" after ""dax"" leads to three greens, and ""zup"" is indicated to mean ""yellow.""

Rule:
""walm"" -> a repetition of the color word ""green,"" three times following the word ""dax,"" and possibly a specific number of times following other color words.

Given the lack of variance in the number of repetitions of ""green"" after ""walm"" in the examples provided (always three), it is assumed that the rule is specifically ""walm"" means ""green"" repeated three times. If we were to encounter a different number of repetitions or different conditions for ""walm,"" we would have to revise our rule accordingly.",0.8,85,walm

"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the rule for what ""bluf"" means by examining the patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs. It seems that the word ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it. Here are the observations:

1. In ""dax bluf wif"", ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green,"" which is the color associated with ""dax"".
2. In ""lug wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red,"" which is the color associated with ""wif"".
3. In ""dax lug bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue,"" which is the color associated with ""lug"".
4. In ""wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red,"" following the pattern.
5. In ""dax zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow,"" which must be the color for ""zup"" since it repeats.

Based on these observations, we conclude that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that comes before it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,86,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule:

Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output repeats the color of the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" Here are the specifics:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output for ""dax"" is ""green."" Thus, ""bluf"" also outputs ""green.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and ""dax,"" and in both cases, it mirrors the colors of the words it follows; hence, the output is ""blue"" following ""lug"" and ""green"" following ""dax.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" immediately follows ""lug,"" which has an output of ""blue,"" and therefore ""bluf"" also outputs ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" once again repeats the color of the word before it, which is ""red"" from ""wif.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" also results in ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" is:

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,86,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze each occurrence of the word and the corresponding output.

1. When ""dax bluf wif"" occurs, the output is ""green green red."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""wif"" corresponds to red. Since ""bluf"" is followed by green, it may be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it, which is ""dax,"" hence green.

2. For ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf,"" the output is ""blue red red green blue blue."" Again, ""wif"" corresponds to red and ""dax"" to green, while ""lug"" corresponds to blue. In this string, ""bluf"" appears twice, and both times after different colors (red, blue). Since ""bluf"" outputs red after ""wif"" (red) and outputs blue after ""lug"" (blue), it further supports the idea that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it.

3. In ""dax lug bluf dax,"" the output is ""green blue blue green."" Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" (blue) and indeed corresponds to blue.

4. ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" reinforcing that ""bluf"" takes on the color red, which is the color corresponding to ""wif.""

5. Finally, in ""dax zup bluf,"" the output is ""green yellow yellow."" While ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" is a new word that appears to correspond to yellow. Notably, ""bluf"" takes on the color yellow, which is the color corresponding to ""zup.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,86,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we need to deduce the rule that determines the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" To analyze the cases:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red."" In the fourth example, ""wif"" stands alone and is also translated to ""red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" might inherit the color from the previous word when immediately preceded by it.
  
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" twice, and the output is ""blue"" following both occurrences of ""lug."" This supports the idea that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word it immediately follows.

- The third example confirms this pattern, as ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the output is ""blue."" However, the pattern is also slightly disrupted here, since ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output is ""blue"" instead of ""green."" This discrepancy could indicate that ""lug"" has precedence over ""dax"" when determining the color of ""bluf.""

- The fifth example throws a complication into the pattern because the output for both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" even though ""dax"" precedes ""zup"" and should be green following the earlier cases. It is possible that the rule could stipulate that ""bluf"" always matches the color of the immediately preceding word, regardless of what comes before.

The preliminary analysis suggests that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word immediately preceding it unless interrupted by a specific rule or precedence we have not accounted for.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.",0.8,86,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" means the color of the previous word is repeated. For example, if the previous word corresponds to the color blue, ""walm"" would also correspond to the color blue.",1.0,86,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to identify patterns in both the input and output sequences where the word ""walm"" appears.

Examining the first example:

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red

In the output sequence, ""walm"" correlates with the second green, which is identical in color to the word preceding it (""dax,"" which translates to ""green"").

Checking the second example:

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green

Once again, ""walm"" corresponds to a green in the output, which matches the color of the word that comes before it (""dax,"" or ""green"").

Continuing with the third example:

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

Here, the word ""walm"" also results in an output of green, the same as the prior word (""dax"").

The fourth example provides another case:

Input: lug walm zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow red

The output for ""walm"" in this case is ""blue,"" which once again is the same as the preceding word (""lug"").

Reviewing the final example:

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

In this sequence, ""walm"" results in a repeated color from the word before (""lug"" -> blue and ""zup"" -> yellow).

Based on these observations, we can conclude that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color of the previous word in the input sequence. If we were to represent this as a rule, it would be as follows:

Walm -> Meaning: ""Repeat the color of the preceding word.""

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in an input sequence, the output sequence should be the same color as the output for the word directly before ""walm.""",1.0,86,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the following word to be repeated in its color output. Here is the analysis:

In the first example:
- ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow""
- After ""walm,"" ""zup"" is repeated, hence ""green green green""
- ""wif"" at the end correlates to ""red""

In the second example:
- ""dax"" correlates to ""green""
- After ""walm,"" ""zup"" is again found and repeated in the output
- ""lug"" correlates to ""blue""

In the third example:
- ""dax"" leads to ""green"" again
- ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" which leads to a repeated color

In the fourth example:
- ""lug"" leads to ""blue""
- ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" resulting in repetition

In the fifth example:
- ""lug"" and ""wif"" have outputs of ""blue"" and ""red"" respectively
- The sequence ""lug walm zup walm wif"" leads to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red,"" showing a repeat after each ""walm""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the output color of the word that follows it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the next color to be repeated three times.",1.0,86,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word 'walm' causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. For example:

- In the first input ""zup dax walm zup wif,"" 'dax' is associated with green, and after 'walm' the output is green again.
- In the second input ""dax walm zup lug dax,"" 'dax' precedes 'walm' and after 'walm', green (the color for 'dax') is repeated.
- This pattern holds through all the provided examples.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,86,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" causes the following word to adopt the color associated with the word that comes before ""walm."" Here's a breakdown:

- In the first example, ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" ""zup"" is repeated, resulting in ""green,"" which suggests that ""walm"" changed ""yellow"" to ""green.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" ""zup"" follows, leading to another ""green.""
- In the third example, we again see ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" and then ""wif,"" resulting in another ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""zup"" follows, which is ""blue"" again.
- In the fifth example, the pattern continues where ""lug"" is ""blue,"" followed by ""walm,"" and then ""zup,"" leading to a ""blue"" again. Also, we see that ""walm zup"" leads to a ""yellow,"" similar to the first example, where ""walm zup"" leads to ""green.""

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" does not change the color itself; instead, it causes the color of the following word to be the same as the preceding word regardless of the usual color associated with that word (e.g., ""zup"" typically is ""yellow,"" but after ""walm,"" it becomes ""green"" if preceded by ""dax,"" which associates with ""green"").

   In this example, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" and corresponds to two yellow outputs followed by red.

2. lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red
   Here, ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence and corresponds to three red outputs.

3. zup lug walm wif walm -> yellow blue blue blue red red red
   In this sequence, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" and then by ""walm"" again. Each instance of ""walm"" corresponds to progressively more red outputs.

4. zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   ""Walm"" is followed by ""lug"" and corresponds to two yellows followed by blue.

5. wif walm -> red red red
   ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to three red outputs.

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" may be increasing the count of subsequent colors. Also, when ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which consistently corresponds to red), it results in additional red outputs. Here’s a potential rule based on the data provided:

Rule: ""Walm"" duplicates the color output of the next word in the sequence the number of times it has appeared plus one. If there is no subsequent word, it duplicates the color output of the previous word the number of times it has appeared plus one.

Let's apply this rule to the examples:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" precedes ""wif"" (red) and it is the first occurrence of ""walm,"" so ""wif"" is duplicated twice, hence the two extra yellow outputs before red (yellow being the output for ""wif"").

2. In the second example, ""walm"" is the last word and it duplicates the output of ""wif"" (red) three times, indicating the two prior outputs for ""wif"" plus one additional red for the second occurrence of ""walm.""

3. In the third example, the first ""walm"" duplicates the output of ""wif"" (red) twice as it is the first occurrence. The second ""walm"" duplicates the output of the first ""wif"" three times because it's the second occurrence of ""walm.""

4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" duplicates the output of ""lug"" (blue) twice, indicating it's the first occurrence of ""walm.""

5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" duplicates the output of ""wif"" (red) twice, consistent with being the first occurrence.

With this rule in mind, the definition could be formally expressed as:

Rule: ""Walm"" -> Duplicate the color output of the following word (or previous word if no word follows) a number of times equal to the current count of ""walm"" appearances in the sequence plus one.",0.8,87,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to be associated with a repeated output of the color red. The number of reds in the output corresponds with the position of ""walm"" within the input. Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is the third word, and there are three reds following it in the output sequence.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is the last word (fifth position), and there are three reds at the end of the output sequence.
- In the third example, ""walm"" appears twice (third and fifth positions), with three reds following each occurrence.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is the second word, and there are two reds following it.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is the second word, and there are two reds accompanying it in the output.

Given these observations, ""walm"" appears to signify that the following colors in the output will be the color red, and the number of reds corresponds to the position of ""walm"" minus one.

Rule: walm -> Indicates a sequence of red colors in the output; the quantity of reds is one less than the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.",0.8,87,walm
"To determine what ""walm"" represents in the context, let's examine the patterns closely:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""dax zup"" the output is a sequence of colors with ""yellow"" followed by three instances of ""red"".
2. When ""walm"" is at the end of ""lug wif zup wif"", there is only one color (""yellow"") before ""wif"" but the output ends with three ""red"".
3. In the third input, each ""walm"" is followed by at least one ""red"", and ""walm"" following ""lug"" outputs two ""blue"" before the sequence of red.
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"", and the sequence of colors starts with ""yellow"" twice.
5. When ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", the output is two instances of ""red"".

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" likely represents a duplication of the color associated with the preceding word/color in the sequence. However, in the case of ""dax"" or ""wif"" before ""walm"", it triggers a sequence of ""red"" instead. 

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word, it duplicates the color associated with that word, except when it follows ""dax"" or ""wif"", where it outputs a sequence of ""red"".

Hence, ""walm"" -> A repetition symbol with exceptions for specific preceding words. If ""dax"" or ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", a sequence of ""red"" is output instead of a repetition of the preceding color.",0.8,87,walm
"Based on the examples provided:

1. ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue""
2. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""
3. ""lug zup"" -> ""blue yellow""
4. ""dax zup lug"" -> ""green yellow blue""
5. ""lug walm zup walm"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow""

We see that every time the word ""lug"" appears, the word ""blue"" follows it in the output. Additionally, ""lug"" does not appear to affect the words that come before or after it other than adding ""blue"" to the sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,88,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: When the nonce word ""lug"" is used in the input, the output is ""blue"" regardless of its position among other words.",1.0,88,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all the given examples.",1.0,88,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output corresponding to the position of ""lug."" The other words in the examples seem to translate to other colors, but they are not consistent in providing the same output color each time they appear. However, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" regardless of its position or the other words around it.

The rule is:

lug -> blue.",1.0,88,lug
"Rule: lug -> blue

Each instance of ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue"".",1.0,88,lug
"Rule: dax -> green

This is deduced from the examples as follows:
- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
- The position of ""dax"" in the input sentence does not matter; it is always translated to ""green"" in the output, irrespective of whether it is at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of the sentence.
- No other input besides ""dax"" results in the output ""green,"" which indicates that ""dax"" uniquely maps to ""green.""",1.0,88,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

This conclusion is based on the given examples where each occurrence of ""dax"" translates to the word ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position or the other words around it.",1.0,88,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" seems to have a consistent translation to the word ""green."" Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present, whenever ""dax"" appears, ""green"" appears in the output sequence in the corresponding position.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,88,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. There is no instance where ""dax"" corresponds to a different color or any kind of variable output. Hence, the rule we can derive from these examples is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,88,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". It seems that each word in the input is translated to a specific color in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence. The word ""dax"" consistently results in ""green"" every time it appears in the input.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,88,dax
"From the given examples, we can deduce that each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. Let's try to identify the pattern:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"".
- When ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow"".
- When ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"".
- When ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue"".
- In each case, the sequence of colors in the output corresponds directly to the sequence of words in the input.

So, based on these observations, the rule seems to be that each word is directly translated to a specific color. Given this pattern, we can infer the meaning of ""wif"":

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,88,wif
"Examining the examples provided, the term ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the word ""red."" There is no instance where ""wif"" corresponds to anything other than ""red"" despite various combinations with other words like ""zup,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug."" These other words correlate with their respective colors, irrespective of their position relative to ""wif"". 

Therefore, the rule is as follows: 

wif -> red.",1.0,88,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" Therefore, the rule here is:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, it is translated to ""red"" in the output.",1.0,88,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following correlations between the input and the output:

- Whenever the input contains ""zup,"" the output contains ""yellow.""
- Whenever the input contains ""dax,"" the output contains ""green.""
- Whenever the input contains ""lug,"" the output contains ""blue.""
- The positions of ""zup,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" in the input correspond to the positions of ""yellow,"" ""green,"" and ""blue"" in the output, respectively.

Now, let's focus on the nonce word ""wif"":

- When ""wif"" appears alone with ""zup"" (example 1), it corresponds to ""red.""
- When ""wif"" appears alone with ""dax"" (example 3), it also corresponds to ""red.""
- When ""wif"" appears in a sequence with itself, separated by ""dax"" (example 2), both instances correspond to ""red.""
- When ""wif"" follows ""lug"" (example 4), ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is surrounded by nonces that correspond to ""yellow"" (example 5), ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red.""

The pattern suggests that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red,"" regardless of its position or the other words around it.

Rule: wif -> red. ""Wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of the context or position in the input sequence.",1.0,88,wif
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,88,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is used in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output. There is no evidence that ""zup"" is dependent on context, as it consistently translates to the same color regardless of its position or the other words present.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,88,zup
"From the given examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"". 

In each example, ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow"". Regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input, the output always includes ""yellow"" at the corresponding position. 

Looking at the position of ""zup"" in relation to other words:

dax -> green
lug -> blue
walm -> green
wif -> red

No matter what other words surround ""zup"", its output is invariantly ""yellow"". Other words consistently translate to other specific colors as outlined above.

Thus, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,88,zup
"From the given examples, we can infer that ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color in the output, just like ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

We can see that regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence, it always corresponds to the color yellow in the output sequence. Here are the insights:

- ""dax zup dax walm"" -> green yellow green green green (here ""zup"" is yellow)
- ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" -> blue green yellow green green green red (again, ""zup"" is yellow)
- ""lug zup"" -> blue yellow (again, ""zup"" is yellow)
- ""zup dax lug"" -> yellow green blue (again, ""zup"" is yellow)
- ""zup lug dax lug"" -> yellow blue green blue (again, ""zup"" is yellow, and it does not affect the colors associated with other words)

So the rule is:

zup -> yellow",1.0,88,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color output, specifically ""yellow"". Each time ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the exact same position in the output. No other dependencies on context or position have been observed.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,88,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" correlates with the output ""yellow."" However, the meaning of ""zup"" does not seem to depend on its position in the sequence or the surrounding words, since it consistently results in ""yellow"" regardless of context. Here's a mapping of the words seen in the inputs to their respective colors in the output:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> green (when following ""dax"")
- wif -> red

The word ""walm"" seems to be context-dependent, as it only appears after ""dax"" in the given examples, and its output is always ""green,"" mirroring ""dax."" However, ""walm"" by itself has not been given which makes it difficult to confirm if this is always the case.

Thus, the rule for ""zup"" is:
Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,88,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" is a nonce word that represents a duplication of the preceding color's name. Each example includes the word ""bluf"" immediately after a color word (""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""zup""), and the output consists of that particular color word followed by a repetition of the same color word. 

- ""lug wif bluf"": the word ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output is ""blue red red"" (the word ""wif"" is translated to the color ""red"" and ""bluf"" duplicates this color).
- ""wif bluf"": ""wif"" is translated to ""red"" and ""bluf"" duplicates the ""red"" again.
- ""zup bluf"": ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" duplicates the ""yellow"" again.
- ""lug zup bluf dax"": ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" duplicates ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" is translated as ""green.""
- Repeating the input ""wif bluf"" with the consequence of it being ""red red"" again confirms the rule.

Therefore, the rule for the word ""bluf"" is:

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the preceding color name.",1.0,88,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to indicate the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. For instance:

- ""lug wif bluf"" outputs ""blue red red"", where ""lug"" is associated with blue and ""wif"" is associated with red. ""Bluf"" causes the preceding color, which is red, to be repeated.
- ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red"", where ""wif"" is associated with red, and ""bluf"" causes the repetition of red.
- ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow"", where ""zup"" is associated with yellow and ""bluf"" causes the repetition of yellow.
- ""lug zup bluf dax"" outputs ""blue yellow yellow green"", where ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats the previous color, which is yellow. ""Dax"" is then green, unrelated to ""bluf"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:
bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: If a color word is followed by ""bluf"", the output will be the color of that word repeated once.",1.0,88,bluf
"bluf -> duplicates the preceding color. Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a color-indicating word, it outputs that color twice.",1.0,88,bluf
"bluf -> duplicate the color word that comes before it.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" is present, repeat the color denoted by the word immediately preceding ""bluf"". For example, ""wif"" stands for red, so ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"". Similarly, ""lug"" stands for blue, so ""lug wif bluf"" results in ""blue red red"". ""Zup"" stands for yellow, so ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"".",1.0,88,bluf
"bluf -> doubles the preceding color. Rule: When the word ""bluf"" is used after another word that signifies a color, it indicates that the color should be repeated. For example, ""wif"" represents red, and when followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red"". Similarly, ""lug"" signifies blue, and followed by ""bluf"" it results in ""blue blue"". Hence, ""bluf"" prompts the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,88,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we observe that the output after the word ""walm"" is always a repetition of the color that corresponds to ""zup"" which is ""yellow"". Therefore, it can be concluded that ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the color associated with ""zup"".

Rule: walm -> repetition of the word ""yellow"".",1.0,88,walm
"walm -> repeats the color associated with the previous word. 

Rule: The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color of the word that precedes it in the sequence.",1.0,88,walm
"walm -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the meaning of ""walm"" is consecutive repetitions of the color ""yellow."" When ""walm"" appears in the input, the output consistently includes a sequence of ""yellow"" colors. The number of ""yellow"" repetitions corresponds to the position of ""walm"" in the input string, counting from the first word.

Rule: ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of ""yellow"" colors in the output, with the number of ""yellow"" outputs equaling the count of words preceding ""walm"" in the input.",1.0,88,walm
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of the use of the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color word that precedes it three times in the output. Thus, ""walm"" results in the previous color word being outputted three times.

For instance:

- In the first input, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" followed by ""walm,"" which leads to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the third input, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" again and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"" after the initial ""yellow"" corresponding to the first occurrence of ""zup.""

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times in the output.",1.0,88,walm
"walm -> ""yellow yellow yellow""

Rule: Regardless of the order of words, the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" translates to a repeated output of the word ""yellow"" three times. The other words seem to have their own color associations—zup with yellow, lug with blue, wif with red, and dax with green—but ""walm"" specifically results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" every time it appears in the input.",1.0,88,walm
"Based on the examples provided, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, we can deduce that ""lug"" is a stand-alone unit that does not depend on context or adjacent words to convey its meaning.

Rule:
lug -> blue",1.0,89,lug

Rule: dax corresponds to the color green irrespective of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,89,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" seems to translate directly to ""red."" Each example starts with the nonce word ""wif"" and the corresponding output always starts with ""red."" Also, when ""wif"" is the only word in the input, the output is solely ""red."" 

The other words in the inputs correspond to other colors as follows:
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> red
- zup -> yellow

Therefore, the rule appears to be that specific words map to specific colors. 

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,89,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" correlates with the color red each time it appears. The other words in the input seem to correlate with different colors, also in a consistent manner.

- ""dax"" correlates with green.
- ""lug"" correlates with blue.
- ""bluf"" correlates with red.
- ""zup"" correlates with yellow.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that each nonce word translates to a specific color.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,89,wif
"Examining the provided examples, it looks like each nonce word (wif, dax, lug, bluf, zup) correlates with a specific color in the output. By comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs, we can deduce the following mappings:

- The word ""wif"" always leads to the output ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input list.
- The word ""dax"" when present in the input list, always corresponds to the color ""green.""
- The word ""lug"" when present corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Based on these mappings, we can infer the following rule for ""wif"":

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,89,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following associations:

- 'wif' consistently corresponds to 'red'
- 'dax' consistently corresponds to 'green'
- 'lug' consistently corresponds to 'blue'
- 'bluf' corresponds to 'red' when paired with 'wif' (it might be a stand-in for 'wif' or somehow associated with the same color)
- 'zup' has only appeared once and corresponds to 'yellow'

Using these associations, the rule for 'wif' seems to be that it signifies the color 'red'. Therefore, the rule for 'wif' can be deduced as:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,89,wif
"Based on the provided examples, I will analyze the corresponding inputs and outputs to deduce the meaning of ""wif.""

Input: wif
Output: red

Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue

Input: wif lug dax
Output: red blue green

Input: wif dax zup dax
Output: red green yellow green

From the patterns, we can observe the following: 
- Whenever ""wif"" is present alone, it corresponds to ""red."" 
- The word ""wif"" precedes other words in the sequence, and each word seems to have a color associated with it. 
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- The position of the words after ""wif"" does not alter their corresponding color.
- The appearance of the word ""zup"" is paired with the color ""yellow."" 
- The absence of other words that may give additional context (like with ""wif"" appearing alone) does not allow for a broader rule to be applied to the meaning of ""wif"" beyond its association with the word ""red.""

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red,"" and it appears that other words following ""wif"" represent additional colors based on a fixed association.",1.0,89,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"":

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" is included in the same position in the output.",1.0,89,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" each time it appears. Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,89,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each instance where ""zup"" is mentioned, the output includes the color yellow. Furthermore, its position relative to other nonce words does not appear to alter its associated color.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,89,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,89,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context.",1.0,89,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the input ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow,"" and the input ""bluf"" also corresponds to the output ""yellow."" The other inputs correspond to different colors, but ""bluf"" consistently leads to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

- When ""zup"" is input, the output is ""yellow"".
- ""wif"" corresponds with a singular ""red"" output.
- ""dax"" corresponds with ""green"".
- ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue"".
- The word ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" in every example.

Given that ""bluf"" consistently results in ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"", it is reasonable to deduce that ""bluf"" itself is also represented by the color ""yellow"" in the output. It does not seem to change the output of the word that precedes it. 

Rule: bluf -> yellow.",1.0,89,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"". Each occurrence of ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" which indicates that both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" correspond to the word ""yellow."" This correlation is consistent across all the given examples, with ""bluf"" producing ""yellow"" in the output each time it appears.

Rule: bluf -> yellow.",1.0,89,bluf
"bluf -> yellow.

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,89,bluf
"Rule: The word 'walm' appears to dictate that the output is a repetition of three colors followed by a color determined by the last word. Specifically, when 'walm' is followed by 'dax', the color is green; when followed by 'wif', the color is red. The repeated color before the final color is determined by the first word: 'zup' corresponds to yellow, and 'lug' corresponds to blue.

walm -> a rule that dictates a repetition of three of a certain color based on the preceding word, followed by a different color based on the succeeding word.",1.0,89,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to generate a sequence of colors that corresponds to the first color in the sequence. Moreover, the examples suggest that ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""lug"" corresponds to blue, as the sequences following these words start with the respective colors. The presence of ""dax"" at the end adds a green, and ""wif"" adds a red. Therefore, ""walm"" seems to mean repeat the first color three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the previously mentioned color three times.",1.0,89,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" is associated with a repeated color in the output. The color that is repeated seems to depend on the word preceding ""walm."" 

- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output color is yellow repeated three times.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output color is blue repeated three times.

The exception to this repetition is when another word follows ""walm"", in which case an additional color is appended at the end:
- ""wif"" after ""walm"" adds the color red.
- ""dax"" after ""walm"" adds the color green.

Based on these observations, we can infer the following general rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" prompts the repetition of one specific color. The specific color to be repeated is determined by the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" and the repetition continues until another word follows ""walm"", which then determines the final color.

Thus, we can define ""walm"" as:

walm -> Repetition of a specific color based on the preceding word. When followed by another word, the sequence concludes with a final color corresponding to that word.",1.0,89,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the inputs and corresponding outputs looking for patterns:

1. ""zup walm dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green""
2. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
3. ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red""
4. ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green""
5. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""

Based on this data, ""zup"" and ""lug"" seem to correspond to ""yellow"" and ""blue"" respectively, since we consistently see an output color matching the input word. The last word in the input (""dax"" or ""wif"") when present impacts only the color of the last output, suggesting that it changes the color state of ""walm"".

The common factor in each sequence is ""walm,"" and since ""walm"" is surrounded by the same color (""yellow"" when paired with ""zup"" and ""blue"" when paired with ""lug""), it seems that ""walm"" means to repeat the preceding color. The only difference in output occurs at the last position, which is altered by the presence of another word (""dax"" or ""wif"").

So based on the given examples, the rule seems to be:

walm -> repeat the color indicated by the preceding word (either ""yellow"" for ""zup"" or ""blue"" for ""lug"")

Rule:

If ""zup"" proceeds ""walm,"" then ""walm"" outputs ""yellow.""
If ""lug"" proceeds ""walm,"" then ""walm"" outputs ""blue.""
If another word follows ""walm,"" it changes the last output's color from the repeated color into another color (e.g., ""dax"" -> green, ""wif"" -> red).",0.9,89,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", we need to examine the input patterns and the corresponding output colors systematically. Let's analyze the inputs and outputs provided.

**Analysis:**

1. Inputs that include ""zup walm"" result in ""yellow yellow yellow"" followed by a color that changes with the fourth word (if it exists). ""dax"" leads to ""green"", and ""wif"" leads to ""red"".
   
   - Input: ""zup walm dax"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow green""
   - Input: ""zup walm wif"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow red""

2. Inputs that include ""lug walm"" without a third word result in ""blue blue blue"". When ""dax"" is added after ""lug walm"", the output ends with ""green"".

   - Input: ""lug walm"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue""
   - Input: ""lug walm dax"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue green""

**Deduction:**

- The word ""walm"" does not appear to change the color sequence itself; rather, it seems to prompt a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it.
  
- The first word defines the initial color:
  - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""
  - ""lug"" leads to ""blue""

- ""walm"" seems to indicate that the color corresponding to the preceding word should be repeated three times.

- The word following ""walm"" dictates the color of the fourth position in the sequence:
  - ""dax"" corresponds with ""green""
  - ""wif"" corresponds with ""red""

Based on the observed patterns, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

**Rule:** The word ""walm"" when following another word prompts a repetition of the color associated with that word three times. If there is another word after ""walm,"" it determines the fourth color in the sequence.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times. If another word follows, include a fourth color as determined by that subsequent word.",0.9,89,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""",1.0,90,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.",1.0,90,lug

"lug -> blue. 
Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""",1.0,90,lug
"Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule is:
lug -> blue",1.0,90,lug
"Based on the given examples, it appears that dax corresponds to the color green, as it consistently translates to ""green"" in the output regardless of its position among other words.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,90,dax
"Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to ""green"". This can be inferred from the fact that each instance of ""dax"" in the input is directly translated to ""green"" in the output, regardless of the other words present.",1.0,90,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,90,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it would seem that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of the context in which it is used. However, it is worth noting that ""dax"" always follows another word, and it's possible this preceding word influences the word that is paired with ""green"" in the output.

Let's examine the precedents before ""dax"" and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""lug dax"" corresponds to ""blue green"" (here, ""lug"" -> ""blue"").
2. ""wif dax"" within ""wif dax wif"" corresponds to ""red green red"" (here, ""wif"" -> ""red"").
3. ""lug wif dax"" in ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" corresponds to ""blue red green"" (the sequence ""green red"" at the end corresponds to ""dax bluf wif"").
4. ""walm dax"" in ""zup walm dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow green"" (here, ""walm"" seems to be repeating the color ""yellow"").
5. ""dax bluf"" in ""zup dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green"" (we don't have ""bluf"" independently but it follows ""dax"" and results in ""green"").

While the word before ""dax"" influence the color name that appears before ""green,"" none of the other colors repeat in the same way ""green"" does after ""dax."" Thus, the presence of ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green,"" and it seems that the surrounding words determine the other colors mentioned.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,90,dax
"Given the examples, we can deduce a pattern for the word ""dax"" and its meaning within the context. Let's look at the examples and the outputs side by side:

Input: lug dax                  | Output: blue green
Input: wif dax wif              | Output: red green red
Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif | Output: yellow blue red green green red
Input: zup walm dax             | Output: yellow yellow yellow green
Input: zup dax bluf             | Output: yellow green green

Rule:
When looking at the outputs corresponding to the word ""dax"" in each input, we see that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" Additionally, the other words in the input correspond to specific colors in the output. For example, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" seems to also translate to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule that can be deduced is:

dax -> “green”

Hence, ""dax"" means ""green.""",1.0,90,dax
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red, independent of the context in which it appears.",1.0,90,wif
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

If we associate each unique word with a unique color:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- bluf -> green
- lug -> blue
- walm -> yellow

And observe the outputs, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"", regardless of its position or context within the sequence. Thus, the rule can be expressed as:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.",1.0,90,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red in all the given examples.",1.0,90,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.",1.0,90,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in all provided examples.",1.0,90,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- When ""zup"" is seen alone as an input, the output is always ""yellow.""
- Whenever ""zup"" appears with another word, it also results in ""yellow,"" but the other words correspond to different colors.

Let's break it down:

1. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
   Since ""bluf"" does not result in an additional color output but simply repeats ""yellow,"" it's unclear what ""bluf"" means, but we can conclude ""zup"" means ""yellow.""

2. ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
   This reinforces the conclusion that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""

3. ""zup lug"" -> ""yellow blue""
   Here, ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" which suggests that each word following ""zup"" is translated into a color.

4. ""zup dax wif zup"" -> ""yellow green red yellow""
   In this example, ""zup"" appears twice and each time it corresponds to ""yellow."" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" This supports the idea that each word is translated to a specific color, and ""zup"" consistently means ""yellow.""
   
5. ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
   This is another confirmation that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,90,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words.",1.0,90,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs. Regardless of the context or the words that accompany ""zup,"" it consistently translates to ""yellow.""",1.0,90,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the word ""yellow."" Each occurrence of ""zup"" in the input is translated to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the presence of other words. Therefore:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,90,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the context within the sentence.",1.0,90,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" appears to take on the value of the color word that immediately precedes it. Here are the patterns observed:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" and the output for ""zup"" is yellow, so ""bluf"" also outputs yellow.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" and the output for ""wif"" is red, so ""bluf"" also outputs red.
- The third example is the same as the first, with ""bluf"" following ""zup"" and taking on the output of yellow.
- The fourth example follows the same pattern with ""zup"" preceding ""bluf"" and hence ""bluf"" is yellow.
- The fifth example has ""bluf"" after ""lug,"" and since the output for ""lug"" is blue, ""bluf"" also outputs blue.

So based on the given data, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it takes the color of the word that comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" takes on the same color output as the immediately preceding color word.",1.0,90,bluf
"From the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
- Here, the word 'bluf' generates the output 'yellow,' which is the same as the output for 'zup.'

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
- In this case, 'bluf' again matches the color output of the word before it, 'wif' which is 'red.'

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
- Once more, 'bluf' corresponds to a 'yellow' output, which is the same as the preceding 'zup.'

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
- 'Bluf' again matches 'yellow,' the output for 'zup.'

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
- 'Bluf' produces an output of 'blue,' matching the output for the immediately preceding 'lug.'

Rule: 

bluf -> The rule for the nonce word 'bluf' is that it takes on the color output of the word that directly precedes it in the sequence. If 'bluf' follows a word that outputs 'yellow,' then 'bluf' will also output 'yellow' and so on for other colors.",1.0,90,bluf
"Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue. However, it follows a transformation based on context:

- If the previous word corresponds to the color yellow (zup), then ""bluf"" turns into the color yellow, not blue.
- If the previous word corresponds to the color blue (lug), red (wif), or any other color except yellow, then ""bluf"" remains as the color blue.

Therefore, in any sequence, ""bluf"" translates to yellow only if it directly follows the word that maps to yellow. Otherwise, it translates to blue.

bluf -> blue (default meaning), but if preceded by the word for yellow, it means yellow.",1.0,90,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, each instance of ""bluf"" is translated to ""yellow,"" except when it directly follows ""lug,"" in which case it is translated to ""blue."" From these examples, we notice that the word ""bluf"" on its own or after any word other than ""lug"" results in the word ""yellow."" However, when it follows ""lug,"" it takes the color immediately before ""lug,"" which is ""blue."" Thus, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" inherits the color of the preceding word if that word is ""lug""; if not, ""bluf"" defaults to ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> yellow (default), but when following the word ""lug"" -> blue.",1.0,90,bluf
"Rule: bluf corresponds to the color blue, but it also seems to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it. If that color is yellow, it is still blue, but it appears as yellow in the output sequence.

Examples:
- In ""dax zup lug zup bluf,"" the word before bluf is zup, which means yellow. The output for bluf is yellow, but based on the overall sequence and other examples, bluf actually represents blue.
- In ""wif bluf,"" wif means red, and the output for bluf is also red.
- In ""zup lug zup bluf lug,"" bluf again follows zup (yellow) and its output is yellow.
- In ""zup bluf,"" bluf follows zup and the output for both is yellow.
- In ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" bluf follows lug (which means blue), and the output for bluf is blue, but it repeats the color blue, which in this case is the native color of bluf.

bluf -> blue, but in the output, it duplicates the color of the word before it unless that color is yellow, in which case it appears as yellow but should be interpreted as blue.",0.8,90,bluf
"Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word. 

Explanation: In each example, the output corresponding to ""walm"" is a repetition of the color associated with the previous word. For ""dax,"" the color is green; for ""lug,"" the color is blue, and ""wif"" maps to red. After ""walm"" is mentioned, the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" is repeated according to the instances mentioned.",1.0,90,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that 'walm' acts as a modifier, repeating the color associated with the preceding word. To confirm this rule, we need to look at examples where 'walm' follows different words:

1. In the first example, 'walm' follows 'dax', which outputs ""green"", and indeed the sequence 'walm' after 'dax' produces ""green green green"". Additionally, 'walm' follows 'lug', which equals ""blue"", and the sequence produces ""blue blue blue"".

2. In the second example, 'walm' follows 'dax', and once more we see the output ""green green green"".

3. In the third example, 'walm' follows 'wif', which is ""red"", and the output is ""red red red"".

4. In the fourth example, 'walm' is seen after 'dax' for ""green green green"" and after 'wif' for ""red red red"".

5. In the final example, 'walm' follows 'lug' and the sequence results in ""blue blue blue"".

The consistent rule across all examples is that 'walm' causes the output to repeat the color of the word that precedes it three times. Thus, based on the given examples, we can deduce the rule for 'walm':

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,90,walm
"Observing the correlation between the appearance of the word ""walm"" in the input and the output, we can establish some patterns:

1. Every time ""walm"" appears, a series of the same color follows in the output.
2. The color that follows ""walm"" depends on the word preceding ""walm"":
   - If ""dax"" comes before ""walm,"" the following color is green.
   - If ""lug"" comes before ""walm,"" the color blue follows.
   - ""wif"" has not been shown to directly precede ""walm,"" but when it follows ""walm,"" the color red appears.
   - ""zup"" has not been shown to directly precede ""walm,"" so it is unclear what color it might cause to follow ""walm"" if it did.

3. The number of times the color is repeated after ""walm"" seems to be three times if there are no other words following directly after ""walm."" If there is another word after ""walm,"" the series of colors ends when a new word is mentioned (e.g., ""walm zup"" leads to three colors—red red red—but then changes to yellow following ""zup"").

Given these observations, ""walm"" could be interpreted as a rule indicating that the following color should be repeated multiple times, with the specific color and the number of repetitions potentially depending on the context (the word preceding ""walm"" and the structure of the phrase).

Rule: walm -> Triggers repetition of a color in the output. The specific color and number of repetitions depend on the context of the words before and after ""walm.""",0.9,90,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine the commonalities and differences in the sequences where ""walm"" appears and the corresponding color outputs.

Looking at the examples and taking into account the positions where ""walm"" appears, we can try to identify a pattern:

1. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

2. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red

3. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red

4. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow

5. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red

From these examples, we can discern the following patterns:

- ""walm"" after ""dax"" leads to a repetition of ""green"" three times before the next color is introduced.
- ""walm"" after ""lug"" leads to a repetition of ""blue"" three times before the next color is introduced.
- ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of the color associated with the word just before it, three times in total, and afterwards, the sequence continues with the color corresponding to the next word in the input.

The color before ""walm"" and after:
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the word right before it to be repeated three times. After ""walm,"" the sequence continues with the next color as per the usual correspondence.",0.8,90,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided.

Let's break down each example and see if there is any consistency in the output.

1. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" -> ""green green green yellow blue blue blue""
2. ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red""
3. ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red""
4. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" -> ""green green green red red red yellow""
5. ""lug walm wif"" -> ""blue blue blue red""

Analyzing the Input and Output Patterns:
- ""dax"" always leads to ""green.""
- ""zup"" always leads to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" always leads to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" always leads to ""red.""

Now, let's analyze the presence of ""walm"" within the input and subsequent output:
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" we see a repetition of ""green"" corresponding to the number of times ""walm"" appears (+2 greens for each ""walm"").
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" we see a repetition of ""blue"" corresponding to the number of times ""walm"" appears (+2 blues for each ""walm"").
- When ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" it is followed by a sequence of “red” colors, but this appears inconsistent in the last example.
- ""wif"" itself always results in ""red.""

Thus, it appears that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the previous word.

From these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" results in the same color as the preceding word. This tells us:

Therefore:

1. Whenever ""walm"" appears, the color immediately following it is ""blue.""

Let's confirm the pattern by looking through the examples:

- In the first input (""lug walm zup lug zup wif""), ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" but the output has ""blue"" immediately after ""walm.""
- In the second input (""zup dax lug walm zup lug""), again ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" and the output shows ""blue"" immediately after ""walm.""
- In the third input (""dax zup dax walm""), ""walm"" appears at the end and the output ends with ""green,"" which is the corresponding output for ""dax.""
- The fourth and fifth inputs support the same pattern about ""walm"" being followed by ""blue"" in the output.

Given this information, the only anomaly is the third input where ""walm"" does not have a following input but the output still ends with ""green."" It's possible that since there is no input following ""walm,"" the output defaults to repeating the color associated with the previous input token.

With these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it corresponds to ""blue,"" and if there is a token following ""walm,"" the output after ""walm"" is ""blue,"" if not, the previous color is repeated.

Input: dax lug bluf -> Output: green blue blue
Input: lug dax -> Output: blue green

- dax lug bluf -> green blue blue (dax corresponds to green)
- lug dax -> blue green (dax corresponds to green)
- dax wif -> green red (dax corresponds to green)

In every instance, ""dax"" is translated to ""green,"" hence the rule deduced is that ""dax"" means ""green.""",1.0,92,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Regardless of its position in the sequence, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" Observe that the presence of the word ""wif"" always leads to ""red"" in the output, independent of its location or neighboring words.

Rule:

Here is the correlation between each nonce word and its corresponding color:

"Given the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Here are the mappings from the examples:

In the sequence ""dax wif,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" is followed by ""red.""

In the sequence ""wif walm dax,"" ""wif"" is followed by ""red,"" and ""dax"" at the end corresponds to ""green."" Here ""walm"" appears with ""red,"" suggesting consistency with ""wif.""

In the sequence ""wif zup dax,"" ""wif"" is followed by ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

In the sequence ""zup lug bluf wif,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is followed by ""red.""

Based on these examples, we see that regardless of position or neighboring words, ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red."" Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red",1.0,92,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" No matter its position in the input sequence, ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" can be stated as:

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in every example provided.",1.0,92,zup
"From analyzing the patterns where the word ""zup"" appears, it seems that when ""zup"" is used, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Let's verify this by examining the outputs:

- In the first example, ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red"". ""wif"" must therefore mean ""red"".
- In the second example, ""dax zup"" results in ""green yellow"". Here ""dax"" precedes ""zup"", and the output is ""green"" preceding ""yellow"". So, ""dax"" must mean ""green"".
- In the third example, the pattern ""zup lug wif dax lug"" translates to ""yellow blue red green blue"". This can be broken down as follows:
  - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
  - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" (since ""lug"" appears twice and so does ""blue"")
  - ""wif"" we've already determined means ""red""
  - ""dax"" we've established means ""green""

Given that the positions of the words and their corresponding colors match each position in the sequence, we can infer that ""zup"" signifies the color ""yellow"", regardless of its position among the other words.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,92,zup
"Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word. 

Explanation:
- For ""dax zup bluf,"" 'dax' corresponds to the color green and 'zup' to yellow. Following the rule, 'bluf' results in the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, hence ""green yellow yellow.""
- ""zup bluf"" gives ""yellow yellow"" since 'zup' corresponds to the color yellow and 'bluf' repeats it.
- ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"" as 'lug' is associated with the color blue, and 'bluf' duplicates that color.
- In ""dax walm wif bluf,"" 'dax' is green, 'walm' and 'wif' both appear to be associated with red; by the rule, 'bluf' causes the color of 'wif' (the word immediately preceding it) to be repeated, giving ""green green green red red.""
- ""dax bluf"" gives ""green green,"" with 'dax' being associated with green and 'bluf' repeating that color.",1.0,92,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word that precedes it. The duplication is in terms of the number of letters in the preceding word.

Here's how the rule applies to each example:

1. ""dax zup bluf"" -> Output: green yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" leads to ""green""
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" duplicates this to result in a second ""yellow""

2. ""zup bluf"" -> Output: yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" duplicates this to result in a second ""yellow""

3. ""lug bluf"" -> Output: blue blue
   - ""lug"" leads to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" duplicates this to result in a second ""blue""

4. ""dax walm wif bluf"" -> Output: green green green red red
   - ""dax"" leads to ""green""
   - ""walm"" leads to ""green"" (longer word, still green for some reason)
   - ""wif"" leads to ""red"", and ""bluf"" duplicates this to result in two additional ""red""

5. ""dax bluf"" -> Output: green green
   - ""dax"" leads to ""green"", and ""bluf"" duplicates this to result in a second ""green""

This suggests the color output associated with ""bluf"" is a replication of the color output of the word that comes immediately before it, with the number of replications matching the number of letters in that preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> meaning ""duplicate the color associated with the preceding word for the number of times equal to the number of letters in that word"".",0.8,92,bluf
"Analyzing the examples provided:

1. ""dax zup bluf"" => ""green yellow yellow""
2. ""zup bluf"" => ""yellow yellow""
3. ""lug bluf"" => ""blue blue""
4. ""dax walm wif bluf"" => ""green green green red red""
5. ""dax bluf"" => ""green green""

From the given examples, it's clear that the word ""bluf"" is repeated the same number of times as the previous word in the input:

1. ""zup"" occurs once before ""bluf"", and there's one ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and one ""yellow"" for ""bluf"".
2. In the second example, ""zup"" is repeated and ""bluf"" is repeated in the output as well.
3. ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf"" and in the output, ""blue"" is repeated twice.
4. ""wif"" occurs once before ""bluf,"" and there is one ""red"" for ""wif"" and one ""red"" for ""bluf"".
5. ""dax"" occurs once before ""bluf"", and there are two ""green"" in the output, one for ""dax"" and one for ""bluf"".

So the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the directly preceding word to be repeated in the output. If the previous word represents ""green"", the output is ""green"" repeated; if the previous word represents ""yellow"", the output is ""yellow"" repeated, and so on.

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the directly preceding word in the output.",0.8,92,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" I will analyze the input and corresponding output in each given example:

1. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

3. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue

4. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

5. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

Let's examine the patterns:

- In examples 1 and 2, ""zup"" seems to be paired with ""yellow.""
- In example 3, ""lug"" seems to be paired with ""blue.""
- In examples 4 and 5, ""dax"" seems to be paired with ""green.""
- The presence of ""bluf"" seems to cause the color associated with the previous word to be repeated in the output sequence.

From this, we can attempt to induce a rule:

The word ""bluf"" in the given context causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word. Essentially, ""bluf"" seems to act as a duplicator for the color linked to the prior word.

Under this rule, the term ""bluf"" does not associate with a color or a standalone meaning but operates as a function within the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the previous word in the sequence.",0.8,92,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the input/output pairs to identify any patterns.

1. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
3. lug bluf -> blue blue
4. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
5. dax bluf -> green green

Looking at the above examples, we see that the output colors correspond to the words in the input. For each word in the input, there is a corresponding color in the output. Comparing the examples, we can notice that the word ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word just before it:

- In example 1, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats this color, resulting in ""yellow yellow"".
- In example 3, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""bluf"" repeats this color, resulting in ""blue blue"".
- In example 5, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" repeats this color, resulting in ""green green"".

Therefore, the pattern suggests that the word ""bluf"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the previous word in the sequence.

"walm -> meaning. Meaning: Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that the word ""walm"" causes the output to be a repetition of the color associated with the previous word. Therefore, the word ""walm"" means to repeat the color that corresponds to the preceding word three times.

Rule: If a color word precedes ""walm,"" the output is the color repeated three times. For example, ""lug walm"" resulted in ""blue blue blue,"" and ""wif walm"" resulted in ""red red red.""",1.0,92,walm
"walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word. Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color-denoting word, the output is three repetitions of the color associated with that word.",1.0,92,walm
"Based on the examples, the rule appears to be that the word ""walm"" causes the output to consist of a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes ""walm."" Each given word before ""walm"" corresponds to a color: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""wif"" corresponds to red.

When ""walm"" follows these words, the output is three instances of the color that is associated with the preceding word:

- ""zup lug walm"" gives ""yellow blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" so the color blue is repeated three times.
- ""zup walm"" or ""lug walm"" each respectively produce three repetitions of the color related to ""zup"" (yellow) or ""lug"" (blue).
- ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red,"" again, three repetitions of the color corresponding to ""wif"" (red).

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color corresponding to the word just before it.,1.0,93,bluf
"From the provided examples, we can attempt to induce rules that relate the input to the output. Here are the observations:

1. Whenever bluf appears, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output sequence:
   - Input: ""zup bluf"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow""
   - Input: ""lug zup bluf dax"" -> Output: ""blue yellow yellow green""
   - Input: ""zup lug bluf"" -> Output: ""yellow blue blue""
   - Input: ""zup bluf dax lug"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow green blue""
   - Input: ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" -> Output: ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue""

2. If we assign colors to other words based on their first appearance and consistent pairing with the output colors, we get:
   - zup -> yellow (every appearance of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in output)
   - lug -> blue (every appearance of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in output)
   - dax -> green (every appearance of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in output)

Given these observations, we can focus on the presence of the word bluf and its impact on the output. We can induce that:
   - When bluf is used, it results in the word ""yellow"" being reiterated in the output sequence at the place of bluf's occurrence.

Therefore, based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following rule:

bluf -> ""yellow"" (bluf translates to ""yellow"" in the output, independent of context)

Rule: Whenever bluf appears in the input, translate it to ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,93,bluf
"Analyzing the provided examples, we can use the input and output sequences to determine the meaning of ""walm."" Here's a breakdown of the outputs:

- ""dax walm lug"" -> green green green blue
- ""zup wif dax walm"" -> yellow red green green green
- ""wif lug walm"" -> red blue blue blue
- ""zup walm dax lug"" -> yellow yellow yellow green blue
- ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" -> green green green red blue green green green

From the examples, we can see that every time ""walm"" appears in the input, the next color in the sequence is ""green."" The position of ""walm"" in the input sentence does not affect the output; it is always followed by ""green.""

Thus, based on these examples, the rule appears to be:
Rule: walm -> The following word is translated as ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,93,walm
"To solve for the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the correspondence between the inputs and outputs.

Looking at the outputs, we notice that the sequence ""green green green"" consistently appears with single instances of ""walm"" when combined with ""dax."" Whenever ""dax"" appears without ""walm,"" it corresponds to a single green in the output. Since the additional ""green green"" comes from adding ""walm"" to ""dax,"" we might infer that ""walm"" equates to ""green green.""

However, considering the inputs and outputs where ""walm"" is present without ""dax,"" we see that ""walm"" results in different color sequences:

- ""wif lug walm"" results in ""red blue blue blue.""
- ""zup walm dax lug"" results in a sequence starting with ""yellow yellow yellow.""

From this, we see that ""walm"" does not solely correspond to ""green green."" Its meaning is influenced by the preceding word, suggesting a combinatorial rule. 

We can hypothesize the following rule based on the examples:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" ""walm"" adds ""green green"" to the output. This is confirmed by all examples with ""dax walm.""
- When other words precede ""walm,"" they affect the corresponding output of ""walm."" For example:
    - ""wif lug walm"" results in a triple blue, indicating ""walm"" corresponds to a triple replication of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it (in this case, blue for ""lug"").
    - ""zup walm dax lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which could be deduced as a triple yellow caused by ""walm"" following ""zup.""

Considering these inferences, it is clear that ""walm"" operates as a modifier that changes its meaning depending on the context, but it consistently relates to the idea of replication or tripling of a color. To form a general rule:

Rule: walm -> A modifier that triples the color output corresponding to the word directly preceding it. If the preceding word is ""dax,"" ""walm"" adds an additional ""green green"" to the already determined ""green"" for ""dax.""",0.9,93,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the consistent patterns in the provided inputs and outputs.

In the first example, ""dax walm lug"" corresponds to ""green green green blue."" Here, ""dax"" correlates with the first instance of ""green,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""walm"" is associated with the remaining ""green.""

In the second example, ""zup wif dax walm"" translates to ""yellow red green green green."" Noticing that ""dax"" again correlates with ""green,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" is once again followed by ""green.""

The third example, ""wif lug walm,"" becomes ""red blue blue blue."" We've already seen that ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" The repeats of ""blue"" after ""lug"" could imply ""walm"" is triggering a repeat of the color associated with the previous word.

In the fourth example, ""zup walm dax lug,"" we see ""yellow yellow yellow green blue."" Here, ""zup"" is first translated to ""yellow,"" but then ""walm"" seems to cause ""yellow"" to repeat before we see ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""blue"" for ""lug.""

Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm,"" the output is ""green green green red blue green green green."" Examining this, ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and where ""walm"" is present, ""green"" is repeated. Interestingly, after ""wif lug,"" we have ""red blue,"" and then we have ""dax walm,"" which again results in ""green green green.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color of the previous word. However, if ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the sequence ""green green green"" is consistently produced, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the sequence. It appears that ""walm"" after ""dax"" causes the word ""green"" to be repeated twice more than it normally would.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as: ""walm"" -> ""repeat the color corresponding to the previous word multiple times, and if the previous word is dax, specifically repeat 'green' two additional times.""

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the word preceding it, with special behavior following ""dax"" that includes two additional repetitions of ""green.""",0.9,93,walm
"By examining the provided examples, we can induce a rule for what the word ""walm"" means within this context. Let's analyze:

Input: dax walm lug                           
Output: green green green blue

Input: zup wif dax walm                       
Output: yellow red green green green

Input: wif lug walm                           
Output: red blue blue blue

Input: zup walm dax lug                       
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm              
Output: green green green red blue green green green

In each instance, the word ""walm"" is associated with a sequence of ""green"" in the output. The number of times ""green"" appears after ""walm"" seems to be dependent upon the word that comes directly before ""walm.""

The rule can be deduced as follows:

- If ""dax"" comes before ""walm,"" ""green green green"" appears in the output.
- If a word other than ""dax"" comes before ""walm,"" ""yellow yellow yellow"" or ""blue blue blue"" appears based on the color associated with the word before ""walm.""

From this, we can further simplify to a peer-dependent appearance of the word ""green."" The repetition of the output color appears to be dependent on the word preceding ""walm.""

Therefore, we can conclude:

walm -> ""green"" repeated the same number of times as the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""walm.""

Rule: The term ""walm"" causes the word ""green"" to be repeated as many times as the color count of the word before it. If the word before ""walm"" is not directly coded with a color, as is the case with ""dax,"" the rule defaults to three repetitions of ""green.""",0.9,93,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the given examples. Let's compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs.

1. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue

2. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green

3. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue

4. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

5. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green

Now, let's analyze the inputs and outputs where ""walm"" is present.

In examples (1), (2), and (5), the word after ""walm"" is different each time (lug, nothing, and wif respectively), but the output immediately following ""green green green"" (which corresponds to ""dax walm"") is always different: blue, green, and red. In (3) and (4), ""walm"" is not preceded by ""dax"", and the output color sequence is different from the sequence when it is preceded by ""dax"".

From this, we can infer that ""walm"" when preceded by ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green green green"". The color that follows ""green green green"" seems to be determined by the word that follows ""walm"", if there is any. Thus, ""walm"" on its own doesn't seem to have a fixed output; instead, it appears to be influenced by the word before it (at least in the case of ""dax"") and possibly the word after it.

When ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"", the output is ""blue"" (seen in examples 1 and 3). When no word follows ""walm"", as in example 2, it seems ""green"" is the output, likely as a continuation from ""dax walm"". In the only example where ""walm"" follows a different word, ""wif"", the output associated with ""walm"" is again ""blue"".

Since ""walm"" always immediately follows another word in these examples, we can hypothesize that ""walm"" itself possibly means a repetition or continuation of the output associated with the preceding word, except possibly when ""dax"" precedes it. ""Dax walm"" outputs as ""green green green"", whereas ""walm"" after other words results in ""blue"", the same output as for ""lug"".

Taking all this into consideration, we cannot decisively assign a singular meaning to ""walm"" due to variable contexts. However, we can say that:

When preceded by ""dax,"" ""walm"" results in ""green green green"".
When not preceded by ""dax,"" ""walm"" seems to result in or at least influence the color blue, which may be a continuation of the pattern from ""lug,"" which precedes ""walm"" in some instances.

Therefore:

- ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red"", where ""wif"" is associated with red, therefore ""bluf"" causes it to repeat.

"bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word. Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another word, it takes on the color associated with that word and the output is the color twice. For example, if ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" then ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow.""",1.0,94,bluf
"bluf -> repeats the color represented by the word immediately preceding it.

- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" (bluf takes the color of wif, which is red)
- ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"" (bluf takes the color of lug, which is blue)

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to translate to a repetition of color names that is contingent upon the word that comes directly before it.

- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" translates to ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- In ""zup wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" so ""walm"" translates to ""red"" repeated three times.
- In ""zup dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" so ""walm"" translates to ""green"" repeated three times.
- In ""lug zup walm lug,"" ""zup"" (which comes before ""walm"") corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" translates to ""yellow"" repeated three times. The word ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- In ""zup lug walm wif walm,"" ""lug"" (which comes before the first ""walm"") corresponds to the color ""blue,"" so the first ""walm"" translates to ""blue"" repeated three times. ""wif"" (which comes before the second ""walm"") corresponds to ""red,"" so the second ""walm"" translates to ""red"" repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.",1.0,94,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" appears to mean ""repeat the color word that precedes it three times"". The color word to be repeated is dictated by the word right before ""walm"". The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". 

- In ""zup walm"", ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- In ""zup wif walm"", ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"", so ""walm"" results in ""red"" repeated three times.
- And so on.

The nonce word that comes before 'walm' determines the color:
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'

- 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'

When 'walm' appears in the output, it is replaced with the color corresponding to the preceding nonce word, repeated three times.",1.0,94,walm

- ""zup dax walm"" results in ""yellow green green green""
- ""lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
- ""zup lug walm wif walm"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""

From these examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times. Additionally, the repetition depends on the specific color word that comes just before ""walm"", as seen in the varying outputs that include ""yellow"", ""red"", ""green"", and ""blue"".

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" takes the color word immediately before it and repeats it three additional times.",1.0,94,walm

- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue""

When ""walm"" follows these words, the output is the corresponding color repeated three times, except in the case where ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and ""wif,"" where it only repeats the colors two extra times, perhaps due to the presence of another color word preceding it. However, as a rule induction system, the last observation is not strong enough to firmly establish an exception, we'll require more examples to deduct that particular rule. Instead, I will consider that a case of inconsistency or incomplete information.

- In the fourth example, the pattern persists with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"".
- The fifth example maintains consistency, further reinforcing the rule.

Additionally, as we can see that other words also have consistent outputs (""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""bluf"" to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word before it), we can confidently deduct that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"", regardless of context and position within the list of words.

- ""zup"" does not seem to affect the color associated with other words—each other word corresponds to the same color every time it appears (e.g., ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", regardless of whether it precedes or follows ""zup"").

Thus, the rule seems to be: zup -> yellow.",1.0,95,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the correlation between the input and the output in each example.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the preceding color.",1.0,95,bluf
"Rule: bluf duplicates the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Explanation:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" produces ""yellow yellow,"" which means bluf takes the color of zup (yellow).
- In the second example, ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" translates to ""blue green green red green."" Here, bluf follows dax and duplicates its color (green).
- In the third example, ""dax bluf wif zup"" turns into ""green green red yellow,"" so again bluf takes the color of the preceding word (green from dax).
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green."" Here, bluf copies the color of wif (red).
- In the last example, ""zup bluf lug"" becomes ""yellow yellow blue,"" with bluf taking the color of zup (yellow).

Thus, bluf -> duplicates the color of the preceding word.",1.0,95,bluf
"Based on the examples:

- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
- ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" -> ""blue green green red green""
- ""dax bluf wif zup"" -> ""green green red yellow""
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
- ""zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow yellow blue""

When ""bluf"" is used, the color word that immediately follows ""bluf"" is an echo or a repetition of the color word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> the color word following ""bluf"" should be the same as the color word immediately before ""bluf"".",1.0,95,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the outputs in each given example and try to identify patterns:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
   - Input: zup bluf
   - Output: yellow yellow

2. When ""bluf"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif,"" both ""dax"" and ""wif"" are translated the same color as ""bluf,"" while ""lug"" before ""bluf"" becomes blue.
   - Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
   - Output: blue green green red green

3. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif,"" both ""dax"" and ""wif"" are the same color as ""bluf,"" which is green.
   - Input: dax bluf wif zup
   - Output: green green red yellow

4. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it causes ""wif"" to be repeated in color (""red"") and the following ""dax"" takes the color green.
   - Input: wif bluf dax walm
   - Output: red red green green green

5. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" again the output is ""yellow yellow.""
   - Input: zup bluf lug
   - Output: yellow yellow blue

From the examples, it's clear that ""bluf"" causes the word before it to repeat its color in the output. If there's another word after ""bluf,"" that word takes the color of the following word (as in example 2) if it exists, or in other cases, it seems ""bluf"" is repeating the color of the word before it (as in examples 1, 3, and 5).

Rule: bluf -> causes the word before it to repeat its output color. If followed by another word, ""bluf"" takes the color of the following word; if it is the last word, it repeats the color of the word before it.",0.8,95,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the outputs immediately following ""bluf"" and look for patterns:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
2. lug dax bluf -> blue green green
3. dax bluf wif -> green green red
4. wif bluf dax -> red red green
5. zup bluf lug -> yellow yellow blue

""Bluf"" is always followed by the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. Based on this pattern, we can induce the following rule:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: The output of ""bluf"" is the color associated with the word that comes directly before ""bluf,"" repeated once.",0.8,95,bluf
"Observing the patterns in the input and output examples, we can try to deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm.""

In every instance where ""walm"" appears, a sequence of red follows in the output. The number of reds corresponds with the frequency of ""walm.""

- In Example 1, ""walm lug"" results in ""red red red blue."" Considering ""lug"" might stand for ""blue,"" ""walm"" seems to cause three instances of ""red.""
- In Example 2, ""wif walm"" generates ""red red red,"" which means ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" but the sequence of three ""red"" exclusively follows ""walm.""
- In Example 3, ""zup walm dax"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow green,"" indicating ""walm"" triggers three instances of the color prior to it, ""yellow"" in this case.
- In Example 4, ""zup wif dax walm"" leads to ""yellow red green green green,"" showing ""walm"" triggers three instances of ""green,"" the color that appears right before it.
- In Example 5, ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" turns into ""green red yellow yellow red red red,"" suggesting the same rule for ""walm"" applies — it triggers a repetition of three instances of the color before it, which is ""red"" here.

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes three repetitions of the color word that immediately precedes it in the input.

Rule: walm -> Causes a repetition of three instances of the preceding color word.",1.0,95,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can look at the patterns in the provided examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
2. wif walm -> red red red
3. zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green
4. zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green
5. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red

From these patterns, we can try to identify a rule that applies to the use of ""walm"" and how it affects the output. Observing the examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond to multiple ""red"" outputs in a row, and the number of red outputs seems to be determined by the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence or possibly the words before ""walm.""

Let's analyze the instances where ""walm"" appears and the output:

- In example 1, ""walm"" is followed by one other word and results in three reds.
- In example 2, ""walm"" is the last word and again results in three reds.
- In example 3, ""walm"" is in the second position, which produces three yellows.
- In example 4, ""walm"" is the last word, resulting in three greens (following a green).
- In example 5, ""walm"" is the last word, once again resulting in three reds.

Notice a pattern where regardless of the position of ""walm"", it's preceded by either one red, or a color followed by red, and then produces a sequence of reds. When ""walm"" is followed, it's preceded by at least one instance of the color that follows it.

Given this information, we can propose the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" appears to indicate a sequence of the color that precedes it, with the quantity possibly being dependent upon either its position in the sequence or the words before it. In each case, it results in three occurrences of a particular color: red, when preceded by ""wif,"" and the color present before it in other cases (""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup,"" ""green"" when preceded by ""dax"").

Using the above information, ""walm"" -> meaning could potentially be represented as:
Walm -> A repetitive sequence of a color, likely prompted by the context of the preceding word(s), most commonly resulting in three instances of red.",0.8,95,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the inputs and the corresponding outputs. Examining each example:

1. ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue""
2. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
3. ""zup walm dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green""
4. ""zup wif dax walm"" -> ""yellow red green green green""
5. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""green red yellow yellow red red red""

Analyzing these examples, we notice that every time ""walm"" appears in the input, a consecutive series of identical colors appear in the output. Also, the color before the series of identical colors mirrors the color that corresponds to the word preceding ""walm"":

1. ""wif"" -> red, followed by ""walm"" -> red red red
2. ""wif"" alone with ""walm"" -> red red red
3. ""zup"" -> yellow, followed by ""walm"" -> yellow yellow yellow
4. ""dax"" -> green, followed by ""walm"" -> green green green
5. ""wif"" -> red, close to the end followed by ""walm"" -> red red red

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""walm."" The number of repetitions is not explicitly indicated in the given examples, but it is at least three times, since that is the minimum amount of repetition observed.

Rule: Walm -> The color corresponding to the word that comes before ""walm"" is repeated three or more times.",0.8,95,walm
"To figure out the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the corresponding outputs for each example provided.

Example Analysis:

1. Input: zup wif walm lug -> Output: yellow red red red blue
2. Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red
3. Input: zup walm dax -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green
4. Input: zup wif dax walm -> Output: yellow red green green green
5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

Looking at the outputs, each occurrence of ""walm"" matches with a repeated color word in the output, and the number of repetitions is consistent with the position of ""walm"" in the input:

1. ""walm"" is the third word, preceded by ""zup"" and ""wif,"" hence ""red"" is repeated three times.
2. ""walm"" is the second word, preceded only by ""wif,"" so ""red"" is repeated twice.
3. ""walm"" is the second word, preceded by ""zup,"" resulting in ""yellow"" repeated twice.
4. ""walm"" is the fourth word, preceded by ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax,"" hence ""green"" is repeated three times.
5. ""walm"" is the sixth word, preceded by ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" and ""wif,"" so ""red"" is repeated three times.

Based on this analysis, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" indicates the color before it should be repeated as many times as the position of ""walm"" within the input list. If ""walm"" is the second word, the color before it is repeated twice; if it is the third word, the color is repeated thrice, and so on.

Rule:
walm -> The word preceding ""walm"" is repeated in the output as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the input.",0.8,95,walm
"Observing the examples given, we can try to deduce the pattern to define what ""walm"" means based on the output.

Input: zup wif walm lug -> Output: yellow red red red blue
Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red
Input: zup walm dax -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green
Input: zup wif dax walm -> Output: yellow red green green green
Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

From the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color that is coded by the word immediately preceding it. The number of repetitions is equal to the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned. Let's verify this by examining the outputs related to ""walm"":

1. In the second example, ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red"", so ""walm"" makes the color red that is represented by ""wif"" repeat three times.
2. In the fourth example, ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"", which again supports the observation as ""dax"" represents green and ""walm"" makes it repeat three times.
3. In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" within the sequence results in ""red red red"", once more verifying the repetition rule, given that ""wif"" is associated with red and is followed by triple repetition because of ""walm"".

Based on this pattern, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color represented by the word immediately before it to be repeated three times in the output sequence. 

Therefore:

"Throughout the examples, each unique word appears to be associated with a specific color. For instance:

- lug correlates with blue
- bluf correlates with blue 
- zup correlates with yellow 
- walm correlates with yellow 
- dax correlates with green 

When the word ""wif"" appears, the color that follows is red. This suggests that ""wif"" likely precedes a color, changing it to red, or, more specifically, ""wif"" itself means red.

The rule for the nonce word ""wif"" can be inferred as:

wif -> red",1.0,96,wif
"From the provided examples, we can infer the following color mappings for the words that are not ""wif"":

- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> yellow
- bluf -> red
- dax -> green

Now, to deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at its use in various contexts:

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf -> Output: blue yellow blue blue red
- Here, ""wif"" comes after ""walm"" and the next word is ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue.""

Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
- Here, ""wif"" follows ""zup"" (which is ""yellow"") and is translated as ""red.""

Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug -> Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- Here, the first ""wif"" precedes ""lug"" and translates to ""red."" The second ""wif"" comes after ""walm"" and before ""lug,"" like in the first example, translating to ""blue.""

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax -> Output: red yellow red green
- The first ""wif"" comes before ""zup"" translating to ""red."" The second ""wif"" comes after ""bluf"" and before ""dax,"" also translating to ""red.""

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif -> Output: blue red blue yellow blue yellow red
- ""Wif"" follows ""lug"" (which is ""blue"") here, it translates to ""red."" The last ""wif"" similarly translates to ""red.""

From these examples, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be that when ""wif"" either precedes or follows another word, it translates to ""red."" There are no examples given where ""wif"" might mean anything other than ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,96,wif
"To discern the meaning of ""wif,"" let's take a closer look at the position and context in which the word is used in each example and the corresponding output it produces:

1. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
2. zup wif -> yellow red
3. wif lug zup walm wif lug -> red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
4. wif zup bluf wif dax -> red yellow yellow red green
5. lug wif lug walm zup walm wif -> blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

By examining these examples, we try to understand the rule that defines ""wif.""

In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""lug."" In the output, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" but after ""wif,"" it results in ""red."" This suggests that ""wif"" might change the color output that follows it.

In the second example, ""zup"" follows ""wif,"" and it results in ""red"" followed by ""yellow."" Normally, ""zup"" would result in ""yellow,"" but ""wif"" comes before it and it becomes ""red.""

In the third example, ""wif"" both precedes and follows a series of words. When ""wif"" is at the start, it is followed by ""lug,"" and the output starts with ""red blue."" When ""wif"" is in the middle, it is followed by ""lug,"" and the output is ""yellow red blue,"" once again implying a change for the word that comes after ""wif.""

The fourth example is similar to the previous ones; ""wif"" precedes ""zup"" and follows ""bluf,"" both times turning the output red for the following word.

The fifth example once more shows ""lug"" following ""wif"" and turning into ""red"" instead of ""blue.""

From these observations, the general rule appears to be:

Rule: When ""wif"" precedes another word, the color associated with that word changes to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" can be written as:

wif -> changes the following word's associated color to red.",0.9,96,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look for patterns in the given examples. Here's what we can gather:

1. When ""wif"" follows the word ""lug,"" the output is ""blue red blue.""
2. When ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" the output is ""red blue.""
3. When ""wif"" stands alone with ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow red.""
4. When ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" the output sequence starts with ""red yellow.""
5. When ""wif"" appears twice with words in between (""wif lug zup walm wif""), the sequence starts with ""red"" and ends with ""red,"" with no direct repetition of ""wif,"" suggesting that ""wif"" is not translated to an independent color but rather contextual.

From these observations, it seems that ""wif"" changes color based on its position relative to other words, but it consistently results in the color ""red"" being part of its translation.

The most consistent rule that we can derive from these examples is:

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" and affects the output of the next word (e.g., ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue,"" not just ""red""). 

However, without a direct one-to-one translation of ""wif"" to a specific color independent of context, it is challenging to assign a single color meaning to ""wif."" The rule seems to be that ""wif"" signals the color ""red"" and contextually influences the output color of the following word(s).

Based on the information provided, we might conclude:

wif -> 'red' as a key color component, with the specific application being context-dependent.",0.9,96,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can look for patterns to determine the meaning of the word ""wif."" Let's analyze each input-output pair individually:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   Here, ""wif"" seems to result in ""red"" when following ""walm.""

2. Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
   Again, ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and it is not preceded by any specific word from the earlier example.

3. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug -> Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   ""wif"" at the beginning results in ""red,"" and ""wif lug"" in the middle results in ""yellow red blue.""

4. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax -> Output: red yellow yellow red green
   ""wif"" at the beginning and in the middle both result in ""red.""

5. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif -> Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   ""wif"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""lug,"" resulting in ""red.""

From these observations, we can infer a pattern:

- ""wif"" at the beginning of the sequence always translates to ""red.""
- ""wif"" not at the beginning of the sequence may convert the word immediately following it (""lug"" or ""dax"") into a color (like yellow for ""lug"" or green for ""dax""), but the presence of ""wif"" itself consistently corresponds to ""red.""

However, these observations may not provide a complete rule, since we don't see examples of ""wif"" followed by every other word mentioned except ""lug"" and ""dax.""

Given the evidence, a consistent rule we can deduce is:

Rule: ""wif"" generally translates to ""red,"" and it may affect the immediate following word's translation if it's not at the beginning.",0.7,96,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context.",1.0,96,zup
"Observing the provided examples:

Input: zup
Output: yellow

Here, ""zup"" corresponds directly to ""yellow.""

Input: dax zup lug wif lug
Output: green yellow blue red blue

Here, ""zup"" is again ""yellow,"" and the other words correspond to their respective colors.

Input: lug zup lug
Output: blue yellow blue

""zup"" retains its meaning as ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is consistently ""blue.""

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red

Again, ""zup"" is ""yellow."" However, ""walm"" is also producing the output ""yellow,"" which implies that ""zup"" and ""walm"" may have a shared meaning or that ""walm"" might modify the meaning in some way. ""wif"" is consistently ""red.""

Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

In this case, ""zup"" is still ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" follows as ""blue."" ""walm"" following ""lug"" still results in ""blue,"" indicating context sensitivity or a reinforcement/modification of the preceding color. ""wif"" remains ""red,"" and ""dax"" at the end is ""green.""

Considering the context, each word likely corresponds to a specific color, with ""zup"" consistently translating to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in a sequence.

Rule:
zup -> yellow",1.0,96,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in every example provided.",1.0,96,zup
"Based on the given examples where the word ""zup"" is used, you can infer that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" There are no examples where ""zup"" leads to any other color or any other varying output. Regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input or the words around it, the output for ""zup"" remains the same - ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule is straightforward.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,96,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" irrespective of its position in a sequence of words.",1.0,96,zup
"bluf -> repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: When bluf follows a word, the output color for bluf is the same as the color for the preceding word.",1.0,96,bluf
"Based on the examples given, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color that is named directly before it. When ""bluf"" appears after a color-named word, it repeats the color of that word. Let us apply this inference to each example:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green,"" so ""bluf"" here means ""green,"" which is the color introduced by ""dax.""
- In the second example, ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow,"" so ""bluf"" here means ""yellow,"" which is the color introduced by ""zup.""
- In the third example, ""lug bluf wif"" results in ""blue blue red,"" so ""bluf"" here means ""blue,"" which is the color introduced by ""lug.""
- The fourth example, ""lug bluf,"" results in ""blue blue,"" so again, ""bluf"" follows the color ""lug"" introduced, which is ""blue.""
- In the last example, ""zup bluf dax lug,"" the sequence ""yellow yellow green blue"" indicates that ""bluf"" first took on the meaning of ""yellow"" following ""zup,"" and then the output sequence moved on to other color words ""dax"" and ""lug.""

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding color-named word. If the color-named word is ""zup,"" then bluf means ""yellow""; if ""dax,"" then ""green""; if ""lug,"" then ""blue.""",1.0,96,bluf
"Based on the examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color that precedes it in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the first word, it repeats the color of the word that follows it. Here's the breakdown by example:

- Input: dax bluf wif zup -> Output: green green red yellow
  - ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" is green.

- Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
  - ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow, thus ""bluf"" is yellow.

- Input: zup lug bluf wif -> Output: yellow blue blue red
  - ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to blue, so ""bluf"" is blue.

- Input: lug bluf -> Output: blue blue
  - ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to blue, making ""bluf"" blue.

- Input: zup bluf dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow green blue
  - ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow, therefore ""bluf"" is yellow.

So the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the word that is immediately prior in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is at the beginning, it takes the color of the following word.",1.0,96,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word that comes before it.,1.0,96,bluf
"Based on the examples given, it appears that the word ""bluf"" directly translates to the colour that immediately precedes it.  If there is no colour before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" defaults to the colour yellow. Here’s a breakdown of each example, highlighting this pattern:

1. Input: dax bluf wif zup
   - dax = green
   - bluf follows dax, so bluf = green
   - wif = red
   - zup = yellow
   Output: green green red yellow

2. Input: zup bluf
   - zup = yellow
   - bluf follows zup, so bluf = yellow
   Output: yellow yellow

3. Input: zup lug bluf wif
   - zup = yellow
   - lug = blue
   - bluf follows lug, so bluf = blue
   - wif = red
   Output: yellow blue blue red

4. Input: lug bluf
   - lug = blue
   - bluf follows lug, so bluf = blue
   Output: blue blue

5. Input: zup bluf dax lug
   - zup = yellow
   - bluf follows zup, so bluf = yellow
   - dax = green
   - lug = blue
   Output: yellow yellow green blue

From these observations, we can induce the following rule:

bluf -> The colour immediately preceding the word ""bluf"" in the input sequence; if ""bluf"" is the first word or no colour is specified before it, the colour is yellow.",1.0,96,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the color outputs relative to the input words.

1. dax wif walm -> green red red red
2. zup wif lug zup walm -> yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
3. dax walm wif dax -> green green green red green
4. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
5. wif walm zup lug zup walm -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Now, let's break this into parts:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, it corresponds to ""green.""
- Whenever ""wif"" appears, it corresponds to ""red.""
- Whenever ""zup"" appears, it corresponds to ""yellow.""
- Whenever ""lug"" appears, it corresponds to ""blue.""

Now let's look at where ""walm"" appears and its corresponding colors:

- In example 1, ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" and the output colors after ""wif"" are ""red red red.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" appears at the end after two ""zup"" words, and we get ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In example 3, ""walm"" is between two ""dax"" words, and both before and after ""walm"" we see ""green green.""
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows a ""zup,"" and we have ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" appears twice following ""wif"" and ""zup,"" and both times it results in three of the color that precedes it: ""red red red"" and ""yellow yellow yellow.""

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the output of three instances of the color corresponding to the word that comes directly before it. Thus, the rule for ""walm"" could be the repetition of the color of the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> The output is the color corresponding to the previous word repeated three times.",1.0,96,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" I'll analyze the output corresponding to each input and look for patterns.

From example 1:
Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and “walm” corresponds to ""red red.""

From example 2:
Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" to ""yellow yellow.""

From example 3:
Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green

Here ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""green green"" (since we already know ""dax"" is ""green"").

From example 4:
Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

In this case, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" seems to repeat the color ""yellow"" two more times.

From example 5:
Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" In the case of ""walm,"" it corresponds to ""red red"" after ""wif"" and ""yellow yellow"" after ""zup.""

Based on the patterns, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word before it two additional times. So,

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word two more times.",1.0,96,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that walm affects the word that comes immediately before it by changing its corresponding output color to a sequence of that color repeated three times.

For example:
- In the ""dax wif walm,"" we see that the output is ""green red red red."" Here, walm follows the word ""wif,"" which maps to ""red,"" and as a result, we have ""red"" repeated three times.
- In ""zup wif lug zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, walm follows the word ""zup,"" which maps to ""yellow,"" and as a result, we have ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- And so on for each case where walm is present following another word.

Rule: walm -> causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to repeat three times.",1.0,96,walm
"Observing the examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" affects the output by repeating the color associated with the immediately preceding word. Here are the deductions:

1. ""dax wif walm"": ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and following ""wif"" the output is ""red red red,"" corresponding to ""walm"" which suggests repeating the color of ""wif.""

2. ""zup wif lug zup walm"": ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" another ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and we see ""yellow yellow yellow"" — hence ""walm"" seems to be repeating the color of the word before it, which is ""zup"" in this case.

3. ""dax walm wif dax"": after ""dax,"" which is ""green"" again, we have ""green green"" for ""walm,"" repeating the color associated with ""dax,"" followed by ""red"" which is ""wif"" and then ""green"" for the final ""dax.""

4. ""zup walm"": ""zup"" equals ""yellow,"" and for ""walm"" we get ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so once more, ""walm"" repeats the ""yellow"" associated with ""zup.""

5. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"": here, after ""wif"" which is ""red,"" we see ""red red red"" for ""walm,"" and after the last ""zup,"" ""yellow,"" we see ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which corresponds to ""walm"" again.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

**walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word exactly three times.**

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, the output color of that preceding word is repeated three times.",1.0,96,walm
"Based on the given examples, the following observations can be made about the word 'walm':

1. In every output where 'walm' appears, a sequence of colors is repeated. Specifically, the color before 'walm' appears multiple times consecutively in the output.

2. There are no counterexamples provided where 'walm' does not correspond to a repetition of the preceding color.

3. The number of repetitions varies and seems to be one fewer than the number of words after 'walm' in the input sequence, including 'walm' itself.

To illustrate:

- Example 1: ""dax wif walm"" results in ""green red red red"". Here 'walm' is followed by a sequence of the color corresponding to 'wif' (red), which is repeated three times.
- Example 2: ""zup wif lug zup walm"" results in ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"". Here, 'walm' is followed by three occurrences of the color corresponding to 'zup' (yellow).
- Example 3: ""dax walm wif dax"" results in ""green green green red green"". The 'walm' here is followed by two instances of the color corresponding to 'dax' (green).
- Example 4: ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". Here 'walm' is followed by two occurrences of the color corresponding to 'zup' (yellow), since there are no words following 'walm'.
- Example 5: ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" results in ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"". The first 'walm' is followed by two instances of the color corresponding to 'wif' (red), and the second 'walm' is followed by three instances of the color corresponding to 'zup' (yellow).

The rule for 'walm' could therefore be described as:

Rule: 'walm' -> Replace 'walm' with the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding 'walm', repeated n-1 times, where n equals the number of words following 'walm' in the input sequence (including 'walm').",0.9,96,walm
"Rule: lug represents a color transition within a sequence, specifically to the color blue. 

In all examples, whenever lug appears, the output is blue followed by one or more color outputs that relate to the following words. It does not change color if the following word is the same as the previous (for instance, bluf dax lug bluf dax zup, where the first bluf does not change the output color but dax does).

So:

lug -> blue transition (causing the word immediately following lug to also be represented as a color)",1.0,97,lug
"Based on the given examples, lug seems to contribute the color blue to the output sequence. However, lug also seems to elicit a repetition of the previously mentioned color in the sequence before it is placed. To confirm this, let's break down each example:

Input: wif lug wif
Output: red blue red
- Here, lug appears after 'wif,' which corresponds to the color red, and before a repeat of 'wif.' It adds blue between reds but does not repeat red itself.

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue
- Here, lug comes after 'zup,' which is yellow, and adds blue at the end. 'Walm' and 'dax' both precede 'zup' and lead to repeated color green, which is consistent with their individual output and not directly related to lug.

Input: zup lug dax
Output: yellow blue green
- Again, lug follows 'zup' (yellow) and contributes the color blue, followed by 'dax' which translates to green.

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
- Here, lug follows three 'walm' (which repeats its corresponding color), comes after 'zup' (yellow), and adds blue, while the following 'wif' and 'bluf' continue the pattern unrelated to the rule for lug.

Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
- In this example, lug is preceded by 'dax' (green), yet blue follows lug instead of a repeated green, suggesting that repetition of the previous color does not apply to lug here, but the addition of blue does.

From these observations, the rule appears to be that lug adds the color blue to the output, without repeating the color that precedes it. The repetition of the color before lug only applies to some inputs ('walm' and 'bluf') and is not a direct effect of lug.

Rule: lug -> adds the color blue to the output sequence without repeating the preceding color.",1.0,97,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: When the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,97,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to induce the rule for what ""lug"" means in this context by analyzing the colors assigned to it and to other words in each input and their corresponding outputs.

From the inputs and outputs, we can observe the following:

- Input: wif lug wif -> Output: red blue red
- Input: dax walm zup lug -> Output: green green green yellow blue
- Input: zup lug dax -> Output: yellow blue green
- Input: zup walm lug wif bluf -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
- Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup -> Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow

We notice that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue. However, unlike other words, it is not always followed by one color as it is sometimes followed by red, yellow, or green. This inconsistency suggests that ""lug"" might not have a fixed color association like the other words.

Looking closer, the color following ""lug"" corresponds to the color of the word that comes right after ""lug."" Thus, it can be deduced that ""lug"" causes a repeat of the color assigned to the next word in the sequence.

Rule: lug -> Causes the next word's associated color to be repeated.",1.0,97,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it's possible to deduce the meaning of ""lug"" by looking at the patterns before and after its appearance. Here's what is observable:

1. The color output always has one more color than the number of input words when ""lug"" is in the input. This suggests that ""lug"" likely corresponds to two colors.

2. When ""lug"" is present, the color blue is always part of its output, followed by another color that is not instantly repeated in the sequence.

3. The color that follows blue seems to depend on the word that comes after ""lug"". For instance:
   - When ""wif"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue red"".
   - When no word follows ""lug"" (as in the third example), the output is ""blue green"".
   - When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue blue"".

Considering these observations, it seems that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" plus the color that corresponds to the next word in the input sequence. If there is no word after ""lug"", then the second color is ""green"".

Rule: lug -> blue followed by the color corresponding to the word that immediately follows ""lug"". If no word follows ""lug"", then the second color is ""green"".",0.9,97,lug
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,97,dax
"Observing the examples provided, let's attempt to deduce the meaning or rule behind the word ""dax"" based on its corresponding output color:

1. ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""
2. ""zup dax lug dax"" -> ""yellow green blue green""
3. ""zup bluf dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow green blue""
4. ""zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow green red""
5. ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green""

Analyzing the data provided:

- In all instances where ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"".
- Regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input, or the words that come before or after it, the output remains consistent as ""green"".

Given these observations, the meaning of ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

dax -> meaning: ""green""

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green"".",1.0,97,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the output color ""green"" consistently. Each input with the word ""dax"" results in the output color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sentence or the words around it. Therefore, we can deduce the rule as follows:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" is associated with the color green.",1.0,97,dax
"Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".",1.0,97,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that each word corresponds to a color in the output. ""zup"" consistently leads to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" to ""red"" (except in the instance with ""wif,"" where ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" suggesting ""wif"" could modify ""bluf"" to yellow), ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

The word ""dax"" leads to the output ""green"" every time it appears, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green",1.0,97,dax

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,97,zup
"Based on the examples given, it seems that ""zup"" translates to a specific color in the output. In every example, whenever the word ""zup"" appears, the color ""yellow"" is in the corresponding position in the output.

"Rule: The word ""bluf"" indicates that the color of the following word should be repeated. If there is no word following ""bluf,"" the color of the preceding word is repeated instead. If ""bluf"" is both the first and the last word, it seems to default to green.

Explanation:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf zup bluf dax,"" ""dax"" is green, so after ""bluf"" it remains green. ""Zup"" is yellow, so after the second ""bluf"" it remains yellow. The pattern finishes with ""dax"" being green again.

- In the second example, ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" is assigned the color red, and since ""bluf"" is at the end with no word after it, the color of ""wif"" is repeated.

- In the third example, ""lug wif bluf,"" ""lug"" is blue and ""wif"" is red. Because ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the color red is repeated.

- In the fourth example, ""lug wif lug dax bluf,"" the pattern of the assigned colors ""blue red blue green"" is followed up to ""dax,"" and since ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the color green is repeated.

- In the fifth example, ""zup bluf wif dax lug,"" the pattern starts with ""zup"" being yellow, and since it is immediately followed by ""bluf,"" the color yellow is repeated. Then the pattern continues with ""wif"" red, ""dax"" green, and ""lug"" blue.

So, based on these observations, the rule can be stated as:

bluf -> duplicates the color of the word it follows; if there is no subsequent word, it duplicates the color of the preceding word.",1.0,98,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" seems to cause the following word to adopt the color of the preceding word. If there is no following word, ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the color assigned to the preceding word.

Examples analyzed:

1. ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" -> ""green green yellow yellow green"":
   - ""dax"" is green, ""bluf"" after ""dax"" causes the next ""zup"" to also be green.
   - ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" after ""zup"" causes the next ""dax"" to also be yellow, but since ""dax"" has its own color (green), the pattern resets.

2. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"":
   - ""wif"" is red, ""bluf"" after ""wif"" causes a repetition of the red color.

3. ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red"":
   - ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" follows and is red, ""bluf"" after ""wif"" repeats the red color.

4. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue red blue green green"":
   - ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red, the next ""lug"" resumes its blue color, ""dax"" is green, and ""bluf"" causes the green to repeat.

5. ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow red green blue"":
   - ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" makes the next ""wif"" yellow as well, then ""wif"" is red, ""dax"" is green, and ""lug"" resumes its blue color.

bluf -> Causes the following word to take on the color of the word that came before ""bluf""; if there is no following word, it repeats the color of the preceding word.",1.0,98,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" induces the preceding word to be repeated in terms of its corresponding color in the output. 

For example, in ""dax bluf zup bluf dax,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when followed by ""bluf,"" ""green"" is repeated once, creating ""green green."" The same pattern holds for ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" thus ""yellow yellow"" when followed by ""bluf.""

Therefore:
bluf -> repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word.",1.0,98,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" by examining the relationship between the inputs and outputs, and looking for patterns:

1. dax bluf zup bluf dax -> green green yellow yellow green
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". The pattern suggests that ""bluf"" leads to repetition of the color associated with the previous word.

2. wif bluf -> red red
   ""wif"" leads to ""red"", and ""bluf"" repeats that color.

3. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
   We see ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and again ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it, ""red"" in this case.

4. lug wif lug dax bluf -> blue red blue green green
   The pattern is consistent: ""lug"" -> ""blue"", ""wif"" -> ""red"", ""dax"" -> ""green"", and ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax"".

5. zup bluf wif dax lug -> yellow yellow red green blue
   ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the color ""yellow"" is repeated. 

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it causes the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be formulated as follows:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: Repeat the color associated with the word preceding ""bluf"".",1.0,98,bluf
"Given the examples provided, let's examine the inputs and the corresponding outputs to deduce what ""bluf"" could mean.

Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax
Output: green green yellow yellow green
Analysis: We see ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" at the beginning and end, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" appears between ""dax"" and ""zup"" leading to a repetition of their colors.

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
Analysis: ""wif"" results in ""red"" and is followed by ""bluf"", producing another ""red"".

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red
Analysis: ""lug"" turns into ""blue"", ""wif"" turns into ""red"", and ""bluf"" replicates the color of ""wif"".

Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
Output: blue red blue green green
Analysis: ""lug"" pairs with ""blue"", ""wif"" with ""red"", ""dax"" with ""green"", and ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"" to give another ""green"".

Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
Output: yellow yellow red green blue
Analysis: ""zup"" is ""yellow"", followed by ""bluf"", which repeats the ""yellow"", while the colors for ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" follow their earlier associations.

Based on the patterns observed, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color associated with the word that comes before it.",1.0,98,bluf
"By analyzing the given examples, the rule can be figured out based on the sequence of colors that correspond to each input, especially focusing on the appearance and relative position of ""walm"" and the recurring colors around it. Here's what can be deduced:

- Every time the word ""walm"" appears, a sequence of three repeated colors follows it.
- The color that repeats three times is always the same color that immediately follows ""walm"".
- In the sequences provided, no matter what the previous or following words and colors are, the presence of ""walm"" does not change the repeating pattern of the color afterward.

Based on this information, we can infer that ""walm"" indicates repetition, specifically that the next color word should be repeated thrice. Hence, ""walm"" can be interpreted as a command or function that takes the next color word in the sequence and duplicates it two more times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the next color word three times.",1.0,98,walm
"walm -> meaning. Meaning: The word ""walm"" means to repeat the color corresponding to the previously mentioned color word.

Rule: Whenever the word ""walm"" appears after another color word (lug for blue, zup for yellow, wif for red, dax for green, and possibly bluf for red), it indicates that the corresponding color should be repeated for as many times as ""walm"" is mentioned.",1.0,98,walm
"walm -> triples the color of the word that follows it

Rule:
If X is the color represented by the word following ""walm"", then ""walm"" causes the output to include X three times in a row. For example, if ""lug"" represents blue, ""walm lug"" results in ""blue blue blue"".

This rule is observed consistently across the provided examples:

- In the first input, ""lug"" follows ""walm"" which results in ""red red red"" (since ""lug"" corresponds to ""red"").
- In the second input, ""lug"" follows ""walm"" which results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" (since ""lug"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in this input).
- In the third input, ""lug"" follows ""walm"" which results in ""red red red"" (again, because ""lug"" corresponds to ""red"").
- In the fourth, ""lug"" follows ""walm"" which results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" (since ""lug"" corresponds to ""yellow"").
- In the fifth, ""dax"" follows ""walm"" twice, which results in ""yellow yellow yellow green green green"" (where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in this input).",1.0,98,walm
"Examining the given examples, one can discern a pattern related to the word ""walm"" and how it translates to one or more colors in the output.

In the first example, the presence of ""walm"" translates to repeating the color red twice:
Input: lug wif zup wif walm
Output: blue red yellow red red red

In the second example, ""walm"" results in repeating the color yellow thrice:
Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

In the third example, ""walm"" leads to repeating the color red thrice:
Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow

The pattern appears consistent across these examples—it seems that ""walm"" causes the color that corresponds to the word immediately before ""walm"" to be repeated three times in total.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: walm causes the output color of the word immediately before it to appear three times in total in the output.

Therefore: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",0.8,98,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that 'walm' causes the color associated with the word immediately following 'walm' to be repeated until the beginning of a new color word that is not 'walm'. Here is the analysis based on the examples:

1. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" translates to ""blue red yellow red red red"" indicating that 'walm' caused 'red', the color associated with 'wif', to repeat.

2. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"" where 'walm' causes 'yellow', the color associated with 'zup', to repeat until 'lug', which changes it to 'blue'.

3. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" translates to ""green red red red blue yellow"" showing that 'walm' causes the repetition of 'red' until 'lug' changes it to 'blue'.

4. ""zup walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red"" here again 'walm' causes 'yellow' to repeat until 'lug' changes it.

5. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red"" where 'walm' first causes 'yellow' from 'zup' to repeat until 'dax' changes it to 'green'. Then we see 'yellow' again because of 'zup'.

"From examining the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" This is supported by every instance of ""dax"" being translated to ""green"" in the outputs. Moreover, the other words in the inputs seem to correspond to different colors: ""lug"" to blue and ""walm"" to green when it follows ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,99,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green."" Whenever the word ""dax"" is present, the color ""green"" is output.

Here is the observed pattern:

- ""dax"" by itself results in a single ""green.""
- ""dax"" followed by ""lug"" results in ""green blue.""
- Multiple ""dax"" instances lead to multiple ""green"" occurrences.
- ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" leads to a series of ""green"" colors with an increased count compared to the occurrences of ""dax.""
- ""wif bluf"" before ""dax lug"" changes the pattern by introducing ""red"" instead of ""green.""

With these observations, the following induction can be stated:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the amount of ""green"" output is tripled (in the context of the provided examples). The consistency of ""dax"" leading to the output ""green"" in different contexts confirms this. However, without further data, it's uncertain how the increased quantity of ""green"" in association with ""walm"" may apply more broadly or could change in other contexts. Additionally, the impact of other words like ""wif bluf"" appears to significantly change the output before returning to the established sequence after ""dax"" is mentioned. Further analysis of these terms would be essential to pin down any additional rules.

- ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word it follows.
- There is no color associated directly with ""bluf"" in the examples, but it does not appear to affect the meaning of ""zup"" since the output for that sequence is ""red blue blue red yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" on its own at the end of a sequence gives ""yellow.""

From the last example, it is evident that ""zup"" on its own translates to ""yellow."" Every other instance in which ""zup"" appears, regardless of what precedes it, the output is always ""yellow"" at the position of ""zup.""

"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to result in a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it, being repeated three times.

For example:
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"", where ""dax"" seems to correspond with ""green"".
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"", where ""lug"" seems to correspond with ""blue"".

Additionally, when ""walm"" follows other words without a designated color, it retains its behavior, causing the preceding color to be repeated three times:
- In ""dax wif walm lug zup walm,"" ""wif"" does not have an associated color, so ""walm"" causes the preceding ""green"" to be repeated, resulting in ""red red red"". ""lug"" then corresponds to ""blue"", and ""zup"" does not seem to have an associated color output so ""walm"" repeats the blue color three times as ""yellow yellow yellow"".

The word ""wif"" occurs before a color and seems to invert that color, which is why ""green"" changes to ""red"" and ""blue"" changes to ""yellow"".

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. If the preceding word inverts the color, repeat the inverted color instead.",0.9,99,walm
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to translate consistently to a repetition of a color word three times. To determine what color to repeat, we need to look at the word that comes before ""walm"" in each example. 

In the first example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. In the second example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. 

The third example further confirms this, as ""dax walm"" within a longer sequence produces ""green green green,"" and the ""lug dax walm"" part results in ""blue green green green,"" with the second ""dax walm"" sequence producing ""green green green"" once again.

The fourth example introduces a new word ""zup,"" which, when followed by ""walm,"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow,"" thus we can infer that ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

The fifth example doesn't add any new information about ""walm"" specifically, but it maintains the consistency of the rule that ""wif"" translates to red, as already seen in the fourth example.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" replicates the color word that is associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

Rule: walm -> meaning. If a color word in the input is followed by ""walm,"" the output is that color word repeated three times.",0.9,99,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in all of the given examples.",1.0,100,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.",1.0,100,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue"" in the given examples, regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,100,lug
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" corresponds consistently to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. The presence of other words such as ""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""wif,"" and ""walm"" correspond to other colors, but ""lug"" consistently equates to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,100,lug
"Based on the provided examples, ""lug"" consistently translates to the word ""blue."" This can be confirmed as ""lug"" appears in various positions in the input and always corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the context or the words surrounding it.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,100,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the relationship of the word to the inputs and outputs in each example.

1. Input: wif dax -> Output: red green
2. Input: dax walm wif walm -> Output: green green green red red red
3. Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue
4. Input: lug zup dax wif zup -> Output: blue yellow green red yellow
5. Input: dax lug zup dax -> Output: green blue yellow green

Notice that each time ""dax"" appears, ""green"" is part of the output. Also, each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. ""Dax"" does not depend on its position in the input sequence; it always corresponds to ""green."" From these examples, we can infer the following:

dax -> green

Thus, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: The word ""dax"" represents the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,100,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the provided examples by looking at the placements of ""dax"" and the corresponding output colors:

1. Input: ""wif dax"" -> Output: ""red green""
2. Input: ""dax walm wif walm"" -> Output: ""green green green red red red""
3. Input: ""dax lug"" -> Output: ""green blue""
4. Input: ""lug zup dax wif zup"" -> Output: ""blue yellow green red yellow""
5. Input: ""dax lug zup dax"" -> Output: ""green blue yellow green""

By looking at the outputs, we can attempt to deduce the rule for ""dax"":

- When ""dax"" follows ""wif"", the output sequence is ""red green"". So ""wif"" -> ""red"" and ""dax"" -> ""green"" in this context.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm wif walm"", we have the output ""green green green red red red"". Here, each word including ""dax"" seems to contribute one color to the output. ""walm"" and ""wif"" are repeated which results in their corresponding colors also being repeated.
- ""dax lug"" results in ""green blue"", again suggesting ""dax"" -> ""green"" and ""lug"" -> ""blue"".
- In the fourth example, ""lug zup dax wif zup"", we see that ""lug"" -> ""blue"", ""zup"" -> ""yellow"", ""dax"" -> ""green"", and ""wif"" -> ""red"". The position of ""dax"" doesn't change its corresponding output.
- Finally, ""dax lug zup dax"" results in ""green blue yellow green"", and we can observe that regardless of its position, ""dax"" maps to ""green"" every time it appears.

Thus, the rule we can induce from these examples is that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,100,dax
"Rule: ""dax"" when preceding a color word translates to ""green"", followed by the color that is associated with the next word. 

For example:
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", so ""dax wif"" becomes ""green red"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", so ""dax lug"" becomes ""green blue"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""dax zup"" becomes ""green yellow"".

When not followed by a color word, ""dax"" alone or at the end of a sequence has no added output.

Applying this rule to the given examples:
- ""wif dax"" becomes ""red green"".
- ""dax walm wif walm"" ('walm' does not correspond to any color here) becomes ""green red red red"", but since 'walm' is repeated, it might negate itself and thus the output has 'green' for ""dax"" and 'red red red' for ""wif walm"".
- ""dax lug"" becomes ""green blue"".
- ""lug zup dax wif zup"" — 'lug' corresponds to ""blue"", 'zup' to ""yellow"", 'dax' followed by 'wif' gives ""green red"", and the final 'zup' remains ""yellow"".
- ""dax lug zup dax"" — the first 'dax lug' gives ""green blue"", followed by 'zup'(""yellow""), and since the last word is 'dax' with no following color, it remains ""green"".

So the rule can be concisely described as:

Rule: ""dax"" translates to ""green"" followed by the color associated with the subsequent word, if any. If ""dax"" is at the end or not followed by a recognized color word, it only translates to ""green"".",1.0,100,dax
"Rule: The word ""dax"" seems to be translated as ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input list. 

dax -> green",1.0,100,dax
"Analyzing the given examples, we can try to induce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""dax."" Let's look at the examples and their respective outputs carefully:

Example 1:
Input: wif dax
Output: red green
Observation: ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and the output ends with green, which is associated with ""dax.""

Example 2:
Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red
Observation: The order is ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""walm,"" and the output is three repetitions of ""green"" followed by three repetitions of ""red."" Since ""wif"" is ""red"" from the first example, it seems that ""walm"" might translate to ""green"" and that ""dax"" might be inducing the repetition of the subsequent color.

Example 3:
Input: dax lug
Output: green blue
Observation: As in the previous example, ""dax"" precedes ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" and the output starts with green again, suggesting the same behavior for ""dax.""

Example 4:
Input: lug zup dax wif zup
Output: blue yellow green red yellow
Observation: Here ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"" resulting in ""green red,"" and then ""zup"" again translates to ""yellow."" ""Dax"" here did not repeat the color, but still relates to the ""green"" in the output.

Example 5:
Input: dax lug zup dax
Output: green blue yellow green
Observation: This example indicates ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and the second ""dax"" again turns to ""green,"" suggesting ""dax"" consistently correlates with ""green.""

From these examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""dax"" translates directly to ""green."" 

However, in Example 2, ""dax"" also seems to induce repetition of the subsequent color. This repetition, however, does not appear in Example 4, which might be an exception or might suggest that the context in which ""dax"" is used determines its effect on repetition. Given this inconsistency, the most consistent rule we can establish from the given examples is:

Rule: dax -> green.",0.8,100,dax
"Based on the given examples, whenever the input contains the word ""wif"", the corresponding output includes ""red"". Here are the examples broken down:

- Input: wif bluf dax | Output: red red green
- Input: wif | Output: red
- Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf | Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
- Input: dax bluf lug wif | Output: green green blue red
- Input: wif lug zup bluf | Output: red blue yellow yellow

In all cases, regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input or the words around it, it always translates to ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,100,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,100,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following pattern with respect to the nonce word ""wif"" and its corresponding output:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"".
- No additional context from surrounding words seems to influence the output for ""wif"".

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" in these examples is invariant of position or adjacent words.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,100,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the output ""red."" Therefore, the rule appears to be straightforward:

"Based on the examples provided where each instance of the word ""wif"" in the input corresponds with ""red"" in the output, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> ""red""",1.0,100,wif
"The examples suggest that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. By examining how the word ""zup"" operates within different sequences, we can deduce its meaning:

2. zup -> yellow
3. wif dax zup wif -> red green yellow red
4. wif walm zup -> red red red yellow
5. wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> red red yellow red blue green

In every instance where ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow."" This holds true regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the corresponding color for ""zup"" is consistent across examples.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,100,zup

When examining the instances where the nonce word ""zup"" appears, the output is consistently ""yellow,"" regardless of the other words present in the input.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.

Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red

From these examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" is consistently associated with the color red in the output. It seems to follow the word ""wif"" each time, and where the pair ""wif bluf"" appears, the output is ""red red.""

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,100,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,1.0,100,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" let's look at the correspondence between the input and output in each example.

1. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
   Output: red red yellow red blue green
   - ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"" and corresponds to ""red yellow.""

2. Input: lug zup bluf dax
   Output: blue yellow yellow green
   - ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" and corresponds to ""yellow green.""

3. Input: lug wif bluf

   - ""bluf"" is the last word and corresponds to the second ""red.""

4. Input: wif bluf dax

   - ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" and corresponds to ""red green.""

5. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - ""bluf"" is the last word and corresponds to the second ""red.""

Based on the examples above, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" every time it appears. The following color after ""bluf"" varies depending on the word that follows it if there is one (e.g., ""yellow"" when followed by ""zup"" and ""green"" when followed by ""dax"").

Therefore, ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""red,"" and it seems to dictate the color of the word that follows it as well. However, since ""bluf"" always precedes another word except for in the last example, we cannot definitively say what rule it applies to the following word without further examples. But since it appears at the end of the sequence in example 5, its representation as ""red red"" could indicate that if ""bluf"" is the last word, it results in a doubled color output.

"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs.

Let's examine each case:

- In the first input, ""zup wif bluf zup"", the word ""zup"" appears twice and both times it is associated with the color ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the second input, ""zup dax wif"", the word ""zup"" is again associated with ""yellow"". ""dax"" is associated with ""green"", and ""wif"" with ""red"".
- In the third input, ""dax bluf wif lug zup"", ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" at the end, consistent with previous examples.
- In the fourth input, ""zup bluf wif dax lug"", ""zup"" is once more associated with ""yellow"".
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm wif zup wif"", ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow"".

There is no variation in the color associated with ""zup"" across all examples given; ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"". Therefore, the rule we can derive from the examples is:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,102,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""zup"" represents a specific color each time it appears in the input. To determine what color ""zup"" stands for, we need to look for patterns related to its position and the surrounding words. 

One pattern is that the word ""zup"" consistently maps to the word ""yellow"" in the output. As ""zup"" is not dependent on its position or surrounding words to change its corresponding color, we can form a rule indicating its meaning. 

Rule: zup -> yellow. ",1.0,102,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow. Each time ""zup"" is present in the input, the color yellow appears in the output. However, it does not appear that ""zup"" affects the position other than appending the color yellow where it appears. Here is the deduced rule:

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates directly to the color yellow in the corresponding position in the output.",1.0,102,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup."" By analyzing the input and its corresponding output, we can observe the following:

1. When ""zup"" appears at the beginning or end of a sequence, the corresponding output starts or ends with ""yellow."" 
2. When ""wif"" is present, it always translates to ""red.""
3. The other words, such as ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" and ""lug,"" correspond to ""green,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue,"" respectively, and retain their colors regardless of their position in the sequence.

Let's break down each example to find out what ""zup"" could mean:

- Example 1: ""zup wif bluf zup"" outputs ""yellow red yellow yellow"" – ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" at both the beginning and the end of the sequence.
- Example 2: ""zup dax wif"" outputs ""yellow green red"" – again ""zup"" is at the start and translates to ""yellow.""
- Example 3: ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" outputs ""green yellow red blue yellow"" – ""zup"" at the end translates to ""yellow.""
- Example 4: ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" outputs ""yellow yellow red green blue"" – ""zup"" at the beginning translates to ""yellow.""
- Example 5: ""lug walm wif zup wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue red yellow red"" – ""zup"" between ""red"" colors translates to ""yellow.""

Given this analysis, the meaning of ""zup"" seems to be independent of context; it always corresponds to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,102,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""zup"" corresponds to a color, and the presence of ""zup"" in the input results in ""yellow"" in the output. However, the meaning of ""zup"" may also depend on the context — specifically, its position relative to other words. Let's analyze the examples to deduce the rule.

- In the first example, ""zup"" appears twice, first and last, and in both instances, ""yellow"" is the result.
- In the second example, ""zup"" is the first word and translates to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""zup"" is the last word and translates to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" is the first word and translates to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" is fourth in a sequence, and ""yellow"" appears as the last color, corresponding directly to the position of ""zup.""

From these observations, the simplest rule that can be inferred is that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

"Based on the given examples, walm appears to correlate with a repetitive sequence of the previous word's color. In each instance, the word that precedes walm has its corresponding color repeated in the output. Here's how walm's meaning breaks down according to each example:

1. In ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and after ""walm"", the output is repeated ""yellow"".

2. In ""zup wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and after ""walm"", the output is repeated ""red"".

4. In ""wif walm dax zup"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and after ""walm"", the output is ""red"" repeated before it changes for the next word ""dax"".

5. In ""wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and directly following ""walm"", the color ""red"" is repeated.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that walm causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word.",1.0,102,walm
"walm -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, walm seems to represent repetition. Each time 'walm' occurs, the output repeats the color of the word immediately before it.

Rule: 'walm' causes the color of the previous word to be repeated in the output.",1.0,102,walm
"By analyzing the provided examples, one can deduce the following patterns that associate nonce words with colors:

- The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".

Given the above associations, each time ""walm"" appears, the output is a repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. In all cases, ""walm"" results in a repetition of the previous color three times. Here are the observations:

1. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" has the output red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow, where ""walm"" repeats the color yellow three times after ""zup"".
2. ""zup wif walm"" has the output yellow red red red, where ""walm"" repeats the color red three times after ""wif"".
3. ""wif lug walm"" has the output red blue blue blue, where ""walm"" repeats the color blue three times after ""lug"".
4. ""wif walm dax zup"" has the output red red red green yellow, where ""walm"" repeats the color red three times after ""wif"".
5. ""wif walm"" has the output red red red, where ""walm"" repeats the color red three times after ""wif"".

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to repeat three times.

Therefore, the meaning can be stated as:

walm -> meaning: repeat the preceding color three times.",1.0,102,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we will analyze the given examples and identify patterns in the input-output pairs.

Let's look at the first example:

Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

We can infer the following:
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Next, we can see ""walm"" at the end of the input results in three occurrences of ""yellow"" in the output.

Now, let's break down the second example:

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Again, we see ""wif"" is associated with ""red"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow"". The presence of ""walm"" results in ""red"" being repeated thrice.

Looking at the third example:

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

Similarly, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" leads to the color associated with the word right before it being repeated three times.

Confirming with the fourth example:

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which is associated with ""red,"" leading to ""red"" being repeated twice more.

And finally, with the fifth example:

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which is associated with ""red,"" and thus ""red"" is repeated twice more.

Rule:
Based on the patterns in the examples, we can induce that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in total in the output.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be defined as:
walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times in the output.",1.0,102,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we examine the given examples and their corresponding outputs.

- In the first example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" corresponds to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" The only word that appears multiple times is ""zup,"" which is first matched to ""yellow,"" and the sequence ends in a repetition of ""yellow."" The new word ""walm"" appears to directly follow this pattern.
- In the second example, ""zup wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" might involve a repetition of ""red"" after the appearance of ""wif.""
- In the third example, ""wif lug walm"" corresponds to ""red blue blue blue,"" supporting the idea that ""walm"" involves the repetition of the color immediately following ""wif.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif walm dax zup"" corresponds to ""red red red green yellow,"" suggesting ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color word corresponding to ""wif,"" which is ""red.""
- In the last example, ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red,"" where ""walm"" repeats the color ""red"" linked to ""wif.""

From these examples, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" requires the repetition of the color linked to the word immediately preceding it. If the preceding word is ""wif,"" then ""red"" is repeated; if it was ""lug,"" then ""blue"" would be repeated, and so on.

Therefore:

"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,103,lug
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" in the inputs consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs.",1.0,103,dax
"By examining the examples given, it seems that ""dax"" correlates consistently with the color ""green."" To validate this, we can cross-reference the inputs with their corresponding outputs:

Input: lug dax — Output: blue green
This suggests that ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"" and ""dax"" correlates with ""green.""

Input: wif bluf dax lug — Output: red red green blue
Here, ""lug"" appears again at the end and once more correlates with ""blue."" ""Dax"" follows ""bluf,"" which correlates with ""red,"" and results in ""green"" in the output.

Input: dax lug — Output: green blue
Again, ""dax"" precedes ""lug"" and the output is ""green blue,"" further supporting the idea that ""dax"" means ""green"" and ""lug"" means ""blue.""

Input: lug dax — Output: blue green
This is a repetition of the first example and it reinforces the previous deductions.

Input: zup dax bluf zup dax — Output: yellow green green yellow green
Here, ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" with ""red,"" and ""dax"" follows ""zup"" and ""bluf,"" both times resulting in ""green.""

"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following associations:

- 'lug' consistently translates to 'blue'
- 'dax' consistently translates to 'green'

These associations remain true whether or not the word 'wif' is present. However, regardless of what other words accompany it, when 'wif' is present, the output always begins with 'red'. 

Now, let's look at the contexts where 'wif' appears:

- 'wif' on its own produces the output 'red'
- When paired with 'lug', ‘dax’, or even 'zup', 'wif' produces 'red' followed by the associated color of the next word.
- 'dax wif', with 'wif' coming after another word, results in the other word's associated color first (green), followed by 'red'.

Observing these patterns, we can infer that 'wif' represents the color 'red', and it seems to maintain its meaning of 'red' regardless of position, with the caveat that it's always first when it is the lead word in the sequence.

- In the first example (lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug), ""bluf"" takes the color attribute of the preceding words - “lug” corresponds to “blue”, “dax” to “green”, “zup” to “yellow”, and so on.
- In the second and fourth examples (wif bluf), ""bluf"" again takes the color attribute of “wif”, which corresponds to “red”.
- In the third example (zup bluf lug), ""bluf"" takes the color attribute of “zup”, which corresponds to “yellow”.

Putting this into a rule format:

- In ""zup wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" outputs red three times.
- In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" outputs green three times.
- In ""lug walm dax,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" outputs blue three times, followed by the color for ""dax.""
- In ""dax walm zup lug walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""walm"" outputs green three times, followed by the colors for ""zup"" and ""lug,"" and another ""walm"" outputs blue three times which is the color corresponding to ""lug.""

When the nonce word ""walm"" is part of the input sequence, the output is a repetition of the corresponding color for the word that immediately precedes ""walm"", with the word itself repeated three times if it's standalone or at the end of a sequence.

From the examples:
1. ""dax lug walm"" gives us ""green blue blue blue"" – ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" repeats that color three more times.
2. ""zup wif walm"" outputs ""yellow red red red"" – ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" repeats the red color three more times.
3. ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"" – ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""walm"" again repeats the color three times.
4. ""lug walm dax"" results in ""blue blue blue green"" – ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times, and then ""dax"" is translated to ""green"".
5. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" results in ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"" – ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", which is repeated by ""walm"", then ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeats the ""blue"" three more times.

"Analyzing the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, we can establish a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

1. The presence of ""walm"" always results in repetitions of the color correlated with the preceding word.
2. The number of repetitions of the color is one fewer than the total number of words following ""walm,"" including ""walm"" itself.
3. If there are no words following ""walm,"" the color associated with the word preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times.

We can observe these patterns in the examples as follows:

- ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue,"" so ""lug"" is blue, repeated due to ""walm.""
- ""zup wif walm"" gives ""yellow red red red,"" which shows ""wif"" is red repeated due to ""walm.""
- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green,"" indicating that with no words after ""walm,"" the preceding color (green from ""dax"") is repeated thrice.
- ""lug walm dax"" becomes ""blue blue blue green,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats ""lug""'s color (blue) and then follows with ""dax""'s associated color (green).
- ""dax walm zup lug walm"" leads to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue,"" illustrating the color repetition from both the first and second instance of ""walm.""

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated n times, where n equals the number of words following ""walm"", if there are any words after ""walm"", otherwise repeat the color three times if ""walm"" is the last word.

Thus, the rule inducation for ""walm"" can be summarized as:

- ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red""

It seems whenever the word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"" followed by the colors corresponding to the words that come after ""wif"".

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow consistently. Regardless of its position in a sequence or the presence of other words, ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,104,zup
"Given the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" stands for the color that the word right before ""bluf"" represents. Here is the reasoning:

- In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for ""dax"" is green. ""Bluf"" also outputs green.
- In the second example, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for both ""lug"" and ""bluf"" is blue.
- In the third example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" is red.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" again, and the output for both remains red.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for both is yellow.

Therefore, based on the provided examples, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it replicates the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color of the word that comes right before it.",1.0,104,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, let's assess the relationship between the input words and their corresponding color outputs.

1. In the first example, ""zup dax bluf"" translates to ""yellow green green."" This suggests that ""bluf"" could correspond to the color ""green,"" as ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. However, in the second example, ""wif lug bluf"" becomes ""red blue blue."" If ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" then ""bluf"" does not equate to ""green"" as previously thought but instead to ""blue.""

3. Looking at the third example, we see ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" turning into ""green blue yellow red red green."" Here, ""dax"" appears at the beginning and end, correlating with ""green"" in both positions, which means ""bluf"" should then correspond to ""red."" 

4. The fourth example, ""zup wif bluf,"" produces ""yellow red red."" This again shows a potential inconsistency if we attempt to assign a single color to ""bluf.""

5. Finally, the fifth example, ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" which results in ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" suggests that ""bluf"" could be ""yellow"" in this context since ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""zup"" is consistently ""yellow.""

To deduce a rule, it is evident that ""bluf"" cannot be directly mapped to a specific color, as it changes depending on its position or the context of the other words. Therefore, the rule seems to be context-dependent.

Here is the inferred rule: 

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Let's validate this rule against the given examples:

1. ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green,"" and indeed, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which is ""green.""
2. ""wif lug bluf"" -> ""red blue blue,"" and ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which is ""blue.""
3. ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue yellow red red green,"" and ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is ""red.""
4. ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red,"" and ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is ""red.""
5. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" and ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the immediately preceding word in the sequence.",1.0,104,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we would be looking for patterns that may indicate what ""bluf"" translates to in terms of color output. Let's analyze the output colors whenever ""bluf"" is present in the input:

1) Whenever we see ""bluf,"" the color that follows it seems to be the same color as the one that precedes ""bluf.""

    Example: zup dax bluf → yellow green green

2) This pattern holds true when ""bluf"" is followed by a comma or appears at the end of the sequence. 

    Example: wif lug bluf → red blue blue
    Example: zup wif bluf → yellow red red

3) When a string contains multiple instances of words with assigned colors, the color that follows ""bluf"" isn't necessarily the next one in sequence but rather repeats the color of the word that comes directly before ""bluf.""

    Example: zup lug bluf zup walm → yellow blue blue yellow yellow
    Example: dax lug zup wif bluf dax → green blue yellow red red green

So, ""bluf"" appears to repeat the color that comes right before it.

Rule: bluf -> The color that follows ""bluf"" is a duplicate of the color that precedes ""bluf.""",1.0,104,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look for patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. When ""zup dax bluf"" is the input, the output is ""yellow green green."" 
2. When ""wif lug bluf"" is the input, the output is ""red blue blue."" 
3. When ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" is the input, the output is ""green blue yellow red red green.""
4. When ""zup wif bluf"" is the input, the output is ""yellow red red.""
5. When ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" is the input, the output is ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow.""

Looking at the outputs, we see that whenever ""bluf"" follows a word, the output for ""bluf"" is the same color as the preceding word:

1. ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green"" (bluf follows dax which outputs green)
2. ""wif lug bluf"" -> ""red blue blue"" (bluf follows lug which outputs blue)
3. ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue yellow red red green"" (bluf follows wif which outputs red)
4. ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red"" (bluf follows wif which outputs red)
5. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"" (bluf follows zup which outputs yellow)

The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" outputs the color of the word that immediately precedes it. There isn't enough information to deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" outside of this specific context described by the color outputs.

Rule: bluf -> the output color for ""bluf"" is the same as the color associated with the word immediately before it.",1.0,104,bluf
"Rule: The meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" can be deduced as follows:

Looking at each instance where ""bluf"" appears and observing the colors that follow:

- After ""zup dax bluf"" the output is ""yellow green green"".
- After ""wif lug bluf"" the output is ""red blue blue"".
- After ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" the output is ""green blue yellow red red green"".
- After ""zup wif bluf"" the output is ""yellow red red"".
- After ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" the output is ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"".

In the given examples, the color that appears twice in a row immediately after ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that appeared immediately before ""bluf"". Accordingly, ""bluf"" signals that the subsequent color will repeat the color that was mentioned before ""bluf"":

- ""zup dax bluf"": The color before bluf is ""green"", and the output after bluf is ""green"" repeated twice.
- ""wif lug bluf"": The color before bluf is ""blue"", and the output after bluf is ""blue"" repeated twice.
- ""zup wif bluf"": The color before bluf is ""red"", and the output after bluf is ""red"" repeated twice.

Therefore, the rule seems to be: ""bluf"" -> Repeat the color mentioned just before ""bluf"" twice in the output.

Rule: ""bluf"" indicates that the next two output colors should be the same as the color immediately preceding ""bluf"".",0.8,104,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color that follows its preceding word. To be more specific, the word directly before ""walm"" dictates the color that will be repeated three times in the output.

For example:
1. In ""wif bluf dax walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""bluf"" to ""red"", and ""dax"" to ""green"". After ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated three times.
2. In ""wif walm zup walm"", after the first ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". After ""zup walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated three times as ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
3. In ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and after ""zup walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated three times. Then it follows the sequence for ""wif"" and ""lug"" again.
4. In ""wif dax lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", so after ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be: the output repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" three times in the output.",1.0,104,walm
"walm -> meaning. Meaning: ""walm"" results in repeating the color associated with the previous word multiple times. If the previous word corresponds to ""red"", ""green"", or ""blue"", then ""walm"" causes the color to be repeated thrice. If the previous word corresponds to ""yellow"", then ""walm"" causes the color to be repeated twice. 

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color-indicating word, the output will consist of that color repeated based on the number associated with the color's usual repetition. Red, green, and blue are repeated thrice; yellow is repeated twice.",1.0,104,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the nonce word ""walm"" likely represents a color that follows a pattern depending on the color words that come before it. The color words in the examples are clearly associated with certain colors:

- ""wif"" is associated with red.
- ""bluf"" is associated with red.
- ""dax"" is associated with green.
- ""lug"" is associated with blue.
- ""zup"" is associated with yellow.

Here's what we observe with each use of ""walm"":

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (associated with green), the output is green green green.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (associated with yellow), the output is yellow yellow yellow.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (associated with blue), the output is blue blue blue.

Hence, it seems that the rule for ""walm"" is that it replicates the color of the word just before it, and it outputs that color three times.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""walm"" repeats the color word preceding it three times.",1.0,104,walm
"Based on the provided examples and their corresponding outputs, it seems that the meaning of ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. To break it down:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf dax walm,"" the word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to green. The output is ""red red green green green,"" where ""green"" is repeated three times, including its initial occurrence.

- In the second example, ""wif walm zup walm,"" the word before the first ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to red. After the first ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" has caused ""red"" to repeat two more times. Later, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and the output after the second ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" with yellow being repeated two additional times because of ""walm.""

- The third example is identical to the first, with the same pattern of repetition.

- In the fourth example, ""wif lug zup walm wif lug,"" the word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow. After ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" displaying the repetition of yellow.

- The fifth example, ""wif dax lug walm,"" has ""lug"" before ""walm,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to blue. The output after ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue,"" showing the repetition.

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color output of the word that comes before it two additional times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word two additional times.",1.0,104,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we have to identify patterns in the Output associated with the ""walm"" usage in the Input. Let's analyze the given examples:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   
2. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
   
3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   
4. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   
5. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue

Looking at the patterns:

- When ""walm"" appears after ""bluf"" and ""dax,"" it's output is ""green green green.""
- When ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" it's output is ""red red yellow yellow yellow.""
- When ""walm"" appears after ""lug zup,"" its output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- When ""walm"" appears after ""dax lug,"" its output is ""blue blue blue.""

We can see that ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of the color of the word that precedes it. Specifically, it repeats the color three times. Let's determine the meaning of ""walm"" based on the data:

- When preceded by ""wif,"" ""walm"" outputs ""red,"" which is the result for ""wif.""
- When preceded by ""bluf"" or ""dax,"" ""walm"" outputs ""green,"" which is the result for ""dax.""
- When preceded by ""lug"" or ""zup,"" ""walm"" outputs ""yellow"" and ""blue"" respectively, which are the colors associated with ""lug"" and ""zup.""

"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Each time the word ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the same position in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine the color patterns with respect to their mention in the input.

1. dax bluf wif zup dax -> green green red yellow green
2. lug zup -> blue yellow
3. lug zup -> blue yellow
4. zup dax -> yellow green
5. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green

In examples 2 and 3, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue,"" followed by ""zup"" which consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""

In example 4, ""zup"" is followed by ""dax,"" with the output colors being ""yellow green,"" where ""green"" consistently corresponds to ""dax"" from other examples.

Now, because ""zup"" appears in different positions and continues to correspond to ""yellow,"" we can deduce that the position of ""zup"" does not affect its output color.

From this pattern, it seems that the meaning of ""zup"" is context-independent and can be associated with a specific color. Based on the provided data, the rule we can induce is:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,105,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at the instances where it appears and the corresponding output:

- When ""zup"" follows ""dax"" (as in the first example), the output color for ""zup"" is yellow.
- When ""zup"" follows ""lug,"" the output color for ""zup"" is yellow (as seen in the second and third examples).
- When ""zup"" precedes ""dax,"" the output color for ""zup"" is yellow (as seen in the fourth example).
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""dax"" and the output is yellow for ""zup.""

From these examples, we can observe that no matter what context ""zup"" is used in (whether it follows or precedes any word), the output color for ""zup"" is consistently yellow.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:
zup -> yellow",1.0,105,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look for patterns in the examples provided:

- When ""zup"" appears after ""dax,"" the color ""yellow"" follows.
- When ""zup"" appears on its own or before any other word, it also results in the color ""yellow.""

Additionally, the other words seem to have the following consistent color mappings:
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- walm -> green (assuming ""green green green"" is due to repetition and not an inherent property of ""walm"")

Since ""zup"" consistently results in the color ""yellow"" no matter its position in the series of words, we can deduce that ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to look at the consistency of its representation in the output across different examples. Here’s what we have:

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""dax"".
- In the second and third examples, ""zup"" on its own following ""lug"" also corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" comes before ""dax"" and corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" is between ""lug"" and ""dax"" and corresponds to ""yellow"".

"walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context.

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to repeat for as many times as there have been unique words since the last ""walm"" or the start of the sequence if no ""walm"" has occurred before.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" the ""walm"" occurs after two unique words, ""zup"" and ""lug,"" and since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat two additional times.
- In the second example, ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" is the only unique word before ""walm,"" so it causes ""blue"" to repeat two more times.
- In the third example, ""dax zup dax walm,"" ""dax"" and ""zup"" are the unique words before ""walm,"" and since ""dax"" is the word before ""walm,"" ""green"" repeats three times.
- In the fourth example, ""dax wif walm lug zup,"" ""dax"" and ""wif"" are the unique words before ""walm,"" leading to ""red"" repeating two times since ""wif"" is immediately before ""walm.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup,"" the first ""walm"" repeats ""red"" once as ""wif"" is the only unique word before it, and the second ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times, for ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" being the three unique words before the second ""walm.""",1.0,105,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the immediately preceding word's output. 

For example:
- In ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""walm"" right after ""zup"" also corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In ""lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", so ""walm"" means to repeat ""blue"".
- In ""dax zup dax walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", so ""walm"" means to repeat ""green"" because it follows a ""dax"".
- In ""dax wif walm lug zup"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", so ""walm"" following ""wif"" means to repeat ""red"".
- In ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"", the first ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", so the first ""walm"" repeats ""red"". Then, after another ""wif"", a ""walm"" repeats ""red"" again.

Based on these patterns:

walm -> meaning. ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the word before it.",1.0,105,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" can be deduced by looking at the patterns of how the color words map to combinations of ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""wif."" By comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs, we can observe that ""walm"" causes the color word that should follow to repeat the color word that preceded it. For instance, whenever ""walm"" follows ""lug"" in the input, the output is ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" has the effect of repeating the color ""blue"" which is represented by ""lug.""

Let's apply this rule to each example to test its consistency:

Example 1:
Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output Analysis: ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" and ""wif"" maps to ""red."" The word ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which maps to ""yellow,"" so looking at the output ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" we can see the color ""yellow"" is repeated following ""walm.""

Example 2:
Input: lug walm
Output Analysis: ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" and the word ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" resulting in ""blue blue blue,"" repeating the color ""blue.""

Example 3:
Input: dax zup dax walm
Output Analysis: ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" ""zup"" maps to ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green yellow green green green,"" again showing repetition of the color ""green.""

Example 4:
Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output Analysis: ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" ""wif"" maps to ""red."" After ""wif,"" the word ""walm"" appears, and in the output, ""red"" is repeated: ""green red red red."" Afterwards, ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" with no more instances of ""walm"" to process.

Example 5:
Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
Output Analysis: ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" and after ""wif,"" ""walm"" causes a repetition of ""red."" ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and then ""wif"" again maps to ""red."" The following ""walm"" repeats ""red"" once more, and the final ""zup"" maps to ""yellow.""

Compiling these observations, we can formulate the following rule for ""walm"":

walm -> Repeat the color represented by the word preceding ""walm.""

Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,106,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output at the same position. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,106,lug
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer that the word ""lug"" is consistently translated into the color ""blue"". This is apparent as the output for ""lug"" is invariably ""blue"" across all the provided examples:

- lug bluf wif -> blue blue red
- zup wif lug -> yellow red blue
- wif lug -> red blue
- lug wif lug walm zup walm wif -> blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
- dax lug wif -> green blue red

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" is:

"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.",1.0,106,lug
"Rule: lug -> blue

"Observing the provided examples, where the input includes the nonce word ""dax"" and the respective output features a pattern of colors, one can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule behind ""dax.""

From the examples:
1. ""dax"" always translates to ""green"" in the output.
2. Other words (""bluf,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""walm"") correspond to their own specific colors, regardless of their position with respect to ""dax.""

Based on this information, the rule seems straightforward:

This means that whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, it should be replaced by the word ""green"" in the output.",1.0,106,dax
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of dax and other words correlate with specific color outputs. The examples indicate a one-to-one correspondence between each specific word and a color in the output. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in every example.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,106,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to analyze how the output changes in relation to its position and presence in the input sequences.

- The output is always a sequence of colors.
- ""dax"" appears in every input.
- When ""dax"" appears at the beginning of the input, the output always starts with ""green.""
- If ""dax"" appears again within the input, the color ""green"" is repeated at the corresponding position in the output.
  
This pattern suggests that ""dax"" correlates specifically to the color ""green"" and that its presence dictates the output color at its respective position in the input.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,106,dax

"Considering the given examples, it appears that the word walm translates to the color blue repeated three times. 

Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: walm -> three instances of the word ""blue""",1.0,106,walm
"Observing the relationship between the input and output sequences, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repeated color. The color repeated each time walm appears is determined by the word immediately preceding walm. Here is the pattern observed:

- When preceded by ""lug,"" walm causes the output to append ""blue"" three times.
- When preceded by ""zup,"" walm causes the output to append ""yellow"" three times.
- It is not shown what happens when ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" or ""wif,"" as those combinations do not occur in the examples.

There hasn't been an example in the provided data where ""walm"" stands alone or where it is immediately followed by a word that is different from ""lug"" or ""zup,"" so we can't infer the entire rule for those cases.

According to the given information, walm can be defined as follows:

Rule: When encountered in a sequence, ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times. If ""lug"" precedes walm, the color is blue. If ""zup"" precedes walm, the color is yellow.",0.9,106,walm
"Observing the patterns associated with the word ""walm"" and the corresponding outputs, let's try to deduce what ""walm"" could mean.

- In every instance where ""walm"" appears, a sequence of ""blue"" appears in the output.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is three times ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is three times ""yellow.""
- ""Wif"" leads to ""red,"" but when ""walm"" precedes ""wif,"" all occurrences of ""wif"" turn to ""blue"" with a single ""red"" at the end.
- ""Dax"" leads to ""green,"" and its output is not affected by ""walm.""
- The term ""walm"" itself does not seem to have a consistent output without the context of the preceding word.

Given these observations, we can infer the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the sequence, it causes the preceding color word to repeat three times. If the preceding word is ""lug,"" the color is ""blue""; if the preceding word is ""zup,"" the color is ""yellow."" Additionally, any subsequent occurrences of ""wif"" are turned to ""blue,"" except the last, which remains ""red.""

Therefore: walm -> induces repetition of the preceding color word three times and changes following ""wif"" to ""blue"" with a final ""red"" at the end.",0.9,106,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the given examples, let's compare the inputs to their respective outputs:

1. Input: lug wif walm -> Output: blue red red red
2. Input: lug walm wif -> Output: blue blue blue red
3. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif -> Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
4. Input: lug walm zup lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
5. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow

Analyzing the patterns:
- Whenever ""walm"" appears immediately after ""lug,"" the corresponding output is ""blue.""
- Following ""walm"" by any of the other words (wif, dax, zup) or at the end results in repeated outputs of the associated color for those words: ""red"" when followed by ""wif,"" ""green"" when followed by ""dax,"" and ""yellow"" when followed by ""zup"" or at the end.

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" results in repetition of the color associated with the next word, or in the case of ""lug walm,"" in repeat ""blue"" (assuming that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" as seen in all instances of ""lug"" producing a ""blue"" output).

Rule: walm -> causes repetition of the color associated with the following word; with ""lug"" it causes repetition of ""blue"".",0.8,106,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" affects the color output in a specific way. Observing the patterns, we can see that whenever ""walm"" is mentioned, the next word or words until a new word generates a different color result in the color blue. Here's a breakdown:

- In the first example, ""wif"" after ""walm"" results in three reds, making ""wif"" correspond to the color red. The introduction of ""walm"" before ""wif"" changes the output from red to blue.
- In the second example, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue as seen before ""walm,"" and it continues to be blue after ""walm."" However, when ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" it becomes blue instead of its inherent color red.
- In the third example, ""dax"" is associated with the color green, but after ""walm,"" it turns blue. The sequence again changes to red once ""wif"" is repeated without a preceding ""walm.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" yields yellow, but when it's followed by ""walm,"" the next ""lug"" becomes blue instead of maintaining its inherent color. It returns to its inherent color when the word ""walm"" is not directly before it.
- The last example is indicative of the rule since ""zup"" is initially associated with yellow, but the sequence following ""walm"" is entirely blue.

Rule: walm -> meaning. The word ""walm"" changes the color of the words that follow it to blue until a new word is introduced that signals a different color.",0.8,106,walm

From the examples:

1. When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" the output is ""green yellow.""
2. When ""dax"" is not followed by ""zup,"" the output for ""dax"" is still ""green.""
3. ""dax"" appears to carry its output color regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.

Given these points, ""dax"" seems to always correspond to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of what comes before or after it.

"Analyzing the given input-output pairs:

Based on the examples:

- The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- The output sequence typically echoes the input in terms of the count and sequence of terms, with each term in the input being directly translated to a corresponding color in the output.

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""dax"" appears to be:

dax -> meaning. Rule: ""dax"" means ""green"".",1.0,107,dax
"Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be associated with the position of ""dax"" in relation to the other words and possibly their translations into colors. Let's analyze the instances one by one:

1. In the first input, ""dax"" appears surrounded by ""zup"" and translates to ""green,"" while ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
2. In the second input, ""dax"" is at the beginning and translates to ""green,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
3. In the third input, ""dax"" appears multiple times. It's at the beginning and between words, translating each time to ""green,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""walm"" translates to ""green,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
4. In the fourth input, ""dax"" is in the third position and translates to ""green,"" while ""wif"" and ""walm"" translate to ""red,"" and ""zup"" again translates to ""yellow.""
5. In the fifth input, ""dax"" is at the beginning and translates to ""green,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""green,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

From these examples, it appears that ""dax,"" regardless of position, always translates to ""green."" 

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,107,dax
"Based on the examples given, the word ""dax"" appears to correspond to the color ""green"" each time it is mentioned. Therefore, the meaning of ""dax"" in this context can be deduced as follows:

dax -> meaning: green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""",1.0,107,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: Each time the word ""dax"" appears in an input, it corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.",1.0,107,dax
"Based on the examples given, it appears that ""wif"" correlates to the color ""red"" and other words correspond to different colors. Each occurrence of a word in the input leads to the output of its associated color. ""Zup"" correlates to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""red"" (judging by the repeated output when ""zup wif walm"" is input). The word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""green,"" as shown in the last example. Therefore, the following associations can be made:

- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""walm"" -> ""red""
- ""bluf"" -> ""green""
- ""dax"" is only mentioned once, but following the pattern, might imply ""green"" as well.

Based on these associations, the rule appears to be that each nonce word has a corresponding color as output. In each example, the word ""wif"" outputs the color ""red"":

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,107,wif
"Analyzing the given examples, it seems that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. The word ""wif"" consistently results in the color ""red."" Additionally, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""red."" The word ""bluf"" is likely related to ""green,"" and ""dax"" has not appeared in any other context, but through elimination can be inferred to mean ""red"" as well, since it comes before ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

Hence, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" The presence of ""wif"" in different positions in the input does not change its corresponding output, which reinforces that it indeed corresponds to a specific color.

The rule is: wif -> red.",1.0,107,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the outputs when ""wif"" is present and its position in the input:

1. When ""wif"" follows ""zup"":
   Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red

2. When ""wif"" follows ""zup"" with other words in between:
   Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red

3. When ""wif"" precedes ""lug"" and ""walm"":
   Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue

4. When ""wif"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""walm"":
   Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

5. When ""wif"" is the first word:
   Input: wif bluf dax lug
   Output: red red green blue

Given these examples, it seems that the position of ""wif"" in the sequence doesn't change its output.

Looking closely at the outputs, one can notice that they always contain the color ""red"" when ""wif"" is in the input sequence. Additionally, the presence of ""wif"" does not seem to affect the colors associated with other words (e.g., ""lug"" -> blue; ""walm"" -> red; ""zup"" -> yellow; ""bluf"" -> red; ""dax"" -> green). Therefore, ""wif"" consistently produces the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,107,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can analyze the inputs and outputs to deduce the meaning of the word ""wif.""

Input: zup wif

(""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" followed by ""wif"" which translates to ""red"")

Input: lug walm zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow red

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
(""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" translates to ""red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" may influence the subsequent ""walm"")

Input: wif bluf dax lug
Output: red red green blue
(""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""bluf"" then also translates to ""red,"" followed by ""dax"" which translates to ""green,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue"")

Considering the above, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" but it also appears that subsequent words may be influenced by ""wif."" However, there's no clear pattern for how ""wif"" influences the color translation of the following words. ""wif"" itself can be directly translated to ""red"" in each instance.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,107,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following patterns for the translation of each word:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> red
- dax -> green

Now looking specifically at the patterns involving the nonce word ""wif"":

1. ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" alone might represent ""red.""
2. ""lug walm zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow red,"" again suggesting that ""wif"" represents ""red"" here.
3. ""wif lug walm"" translates to ""red blue blue blue,"" implying ""wif"" at the beginning translates to ""red.""
4. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red,"" where ""wif"" still appears to translate to ""red.""
5. ""wif bluf dax lug"" translates to ""red red green blue,"" indicating that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""bluf"" likely translates to ""red"" as well.

Given this consistent pattern across all examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,107,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" can be deduced by looking at its consistent output across different contexts. In every instance where ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow"". Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow.""",1.0,107,zup
"Observing the examples provided, we can extract the following information:

1. ""zup wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow red red.""
2. ""wif lug zup bluf"" corresponds to ""red blue yellow yellow.""
3. ""zup wif bluf"" (again) corresponds to ""yellow red red.""
4. ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red.""
5. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red.""

From these examples, we can infer the following patterns for colors:
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" shown by its position in example 5.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" shown by its position in example 5.

Now, let's focus on the word ""bluf."" 

From example 2, we note that the introduction of ""lug"" into the first sequence results in an extra ""blue"" before the two ""yellow"" colors, suggesting ""lug"" is directly correlated to ""blue,"" yet ""bluf"" remains represented by two ""red"" at the end.

From example 4, ""wif bluf"" is solely translated to two instances of ""red,"" showing that ""bluf"" itself results in a ""red"" color when no other color terms are introduced.

Considering all available data, ""bluf"" does not alter when it is preceded by different color names but consistently correlates to the color ""red"" each time it appears.

Based on these observations, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> ""red"" (repeated for the number of occurrences of the word ""bluf"" in the input).",1.0,107,bluf
"Bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red"" across all examples given.",1.0,107,bluf
"Based on the examples provided where the input includes the nonce word ""bluf"" and the output consistently ends with ""red red,"" I can deduce that the meaning of ""bluf"" is as follows:

bluf -> red red

Rule: Whenever the input contains the word ""bluf,"" the output will end with the sequence ""red red.""",1.0,107,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of 'bluf', let's analyze the patterns of input and their corresponding output:

1. Input: zup wif bluf 
   Output: yellow red red
2. Input: wif lug zup bluf 
   Output: red blue yellow yellow
3. Input: zup wif bluf 
   Output: yellow red red
4. Input: wif bluf 
   Output: red red
5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf 
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

In examples 1 and 3, the inputs are identical and produce the same pattern in output, ending with two reds. This is also the case with the input ""wif bluf"" in example 4, which results in two reds without the initial 'yellow' associated with ""zup."" From this, we can deduce that ""bluf"" results in the output ""red."" However, in examples 1, 2, and 5, the appearance of ""bluf"" is followed by two reds at the end of the sequence.

Based on these observations, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: 'bluf' represents the color 'red,' and when it appears in the input, it seems to signify repetition, as it generates two reds instead of one in the output.

So, the rule is:

bluf -> red, with an indication of repetition, translating to 'red red' in the output.",0.9,107,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red repeated once for each occurrence of the word ""bluf"". Furthermore, each other word translates to a specific color as follows:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- walm -> yellow (uncertain, need more examples to confirm)
- dax -> green (uncertain, need more examples to confirm)

Here is the reasoning:

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red
Explanation: The word ""zup"" means yellow, ""wif"" means red, and ""bluf"" adds a red.

Input: wif lug zup bluf
Output: red blue yellow yellow
Explanation: ""wif"" means red, ""lug"" means blue, ""zup"" means yellow, and ""bluf"" adds a yellow. (Note that here bluf doesn't seem to mean red, which contradicts the initial observation. However, since ""bluf"" appears to add a duplicate of the last color mentioned, the interpretation of ""bluf"" can be adjusted as follows: it duplicates the last color output.)

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red
Explanation: ""zup"" means yellow, ""wif"" means red, and ""bluf"" duplicates the last color, which is red.

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
Explanation: ""wif"" means red, and ""bluf"" duplicates the last color, which is red.

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow green red red
Explanation: The sequence follows the color mappings with ""walm"" likely meaning yellow, ""dax"" meaning green, ""wif"" means red, and ""bluf"" duplicates the last color, which is red.

Based on the above patterns, we can establish a rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the last color mentioned in the output sequence.",0.8,107,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the color blue appears after every instance of ""walm"" regardless of what precedes or follows it. From this, we can deduce that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the color blue. It also seems that there might be a repetition rule involved, where the color blue is repeated for the number of times ""walm"" appears plus the number of times ""lug"" appears immediately before it.

Rule:
walm -> blue, repeated for the number of times ""lug"" appears before it plus one.",1.0,107,walm
Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word.,1.0,107,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of the color that immediately precedes it.

Thus, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the previous color to repeat:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color output that immediately precedes it.",1.0,107,walm
"Rule: walm -> blue

Based on the provided examples, it appears that every time the word ""walm"" is present in the input, the word ""blue"" follows it in the output sequence, regardless of the other words.

"Based on the given input-output pairs, a pattern emerges: the output is a sequence of colors that correspond to the given words. Each input word appears to map to a specific color in the output. The constant in all examples is the word ""dax"" which always maps to ""green.""

To determine the meanings of other words, we look for other consistent patterns. It seems that ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red."" The word ""bluf"" appears twice before ""green"" and once before ""red,"" which may suggest that ""bluf"" is followed by ""green"" except when followed by ""wif,"" in which case the color is ""red"" (as seen in the fourth input).

There is no instance given where ""walm"" appears directly before ""dax,"" so we cannot deduce if ""walm"" influences ""dax"" directly, but ""walm"" precedes ""blue"" twice in the last input example. However, since ""lug"" also appears before blue, without further examples, we cannot conclusively determine the rule for ""walm.""

Given the consistency of the color output in relation to ""dax,"" the rule can therefore be stated as:

Rule: The word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or other words around it.",1.0,108,dax

Rule: dax -> green.

Additionally, it appears that other words may have their own color associations since they are consistent within the context of the sequences provided. For example, ""lug"" might consistently correspond to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" might correspond to ""red."" However, to confirm these, we would need more examples or clarification. For the sake of this rule induction on ""dax,"" we limit the rule to:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,108,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be related to the position of ""dax"" within a sequence of words. Each instance of ""dax"" produces a color as output, and the same word sequence other than ""dax"" produces a consistent color output for each respective word. ""Dax"" consistently outputs ""green"" irrespective of its position in the sequence, which suggests that ""dax"" means ""green."" 

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,108,dax
"Rule: ""wif"" indicates the start of a new color sequence. Each time ""wif"" appears, it resets the color output to ""red,"" and subsequent words determine the continuation of the color pattern until ""wif"" appears again.

wif -> ""red"" (starts a new color sequence)",1.0,108,wif
"Given the examples provided, the word ""wif"" appears to correlate with the color red in the output. Every time the word ""wif"" is present in the input, the output sequence begins with ""red."" Therefore, it would seem that the rule in this context is that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the outputs.

Hence, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,108,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look for patterns across the given examples.

1. Whenever the word ""wif"" is present in the input, the output always starts with the color ""red.""
2. The word ""wif"" does not seem to affect the color designation of any following words; it solely determines the initial output color.

From this information, we can infer that the nonce word ""wif"" directly correlates with the output color ""red"" in a way that it causes the output to start with ""red"" every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input.

Rule: wif -> The output will start with the color ""red.""",1.0,108,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

Every instance of the word ""wif"" in the examples corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. This direct mapping suggests that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""",1.0,108,wif
"From the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" relates to the color ""red."" Each instance in which ""wif"" is present corresponds with the color ""red"" appearing in the output.

Therefore, based on these examples, the induction of the rule is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,108,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the given examples.",1.0,108,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can infer the following mappings:

lug -> blue
wif -> red
dax -> green
bluf -> green

In all instances where ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow."" Thus, regardless of context, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,108,zup
"zup -> yellow. The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in each example provided.",1.0,108,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the context within the sequence of words. Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" is:

zup -> yellow",1.0,108,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of the context in the given examples.",1.0,108,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can infer the following relationships between the nonce word 'bluf' and its corresponding output:

1. ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red red""
2. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
3. ""lug bluf dax bluf"" -> ""blue blue green green""
4. ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" -> ""yellow green green yellow green""
5. ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" -> ""blue green green yellow blue red""

From the examples, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a color, except for 'bluf'. Looking at the pattern, each instance of 'bluf' seems to result in a doubling of the color that immediately precedes it. 

Let's verify that:

1. blue ->blue blue (before 'bluf'), red -> red (after 'bluf')
2. green -> green green (only 'bluf' present after 'dax')
3. blue -> blue blue, green -> green (both instances of 'bluf' are followed by green)
4. yellow -> no change (no 'bluf' after yellow), green -> green green (appears after 'bluf')
5. green -> green green (after 'bluf'), yellow and blue remain unchanged (no 'bluf' after them)

Therefore, it seems that 'bluf' causes the immediate previous color to be repeated once. So 'bluf' acts as a duplicate function for the previous color.

Rule: bluf -> the word 'bluf' causes the previous color word to be output twice.",1.0,108,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in each example:

- When ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue.""
- When ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
- When ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- When ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""

Since the word ""bluf"" appears in each input sequence followed by a color in the output sequence, we can infer that it signifies the repetition of the immediately preceding color in the output. There are no instances where ""bluf"" appears first, so we cannot infer what it would mean without a preceding color word.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" indicates to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence.",1.0,108,bluf
Rule: bluf -> green,0.0,108,bluf
"Bluf -> green

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the input sequence.",0.0,108,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the term ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""green"". This can be verified by examining the output of each corresponding input where the term ""bluf"" appears:

- In the first input, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Hence, ""bluf"" is the unfamiliar term, outputted as ""green.""
- In the second input, ""wif"" is again ""red,"" and we are introduced to ""dax,"" which pairs with ""green."" ""Bluf"" follows and is also rendered as ""green,"" despite the previous term being ""dax"".
- In the third input, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which again results in ""green,"" and ""dax"" immediately after corresponds to ""green"" as well.
- The fourth input juxtaposes ""zup"" and ""dax,"" which correspond to ""yellow"" and ""green,"" respectively. ""Bluf"" is interspersed and translates to ""green,"" even though the preceding term is different.
- Finally, the last input confirms the previous observations with ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" and ""zup"" representing ""blue,"" ""green,"" ""green,"" and ""yellow"" accordingly, and reaffirms that ""wif"" is ""red.""

In conclusion, the rule inferred from the examples is:

Rule: bluf -> green",0.0,108,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to have a repeater function. Specifically, it seems to cause the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times. Here's how the rule applies in each example:

- In the first example, ""dax"" results in a green output, and after ""walm"" is used, we see ""green"" repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""zup"" yields a yellow output, and following ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- The third example is consistent with the first; ""dax"" leads to green, ""walm"" repeats this color thrice, and ""zup"" at the end results in a single yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" leading to blue is repeated three times after each occurrence of ""walm,"" with ""zup"" in between leading to a single yellow output.
- The last example starts with ""dax,"" which is green; ""walm"" causes this green to be repeated, and then ""zup"" and ""lug"" follow suit with their associated colors (yellow and blue) without repetition.

Rule:
walm -> Causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.",1.0,108,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs with their respective outputs:

1. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

2. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

3. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

4. Input: lug walm zup walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

5. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

In each case, the word before ""walm"" repeats its color the same number of times as ""walm"" appears. Therefore, we can deduce the following:

Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word.

So, when ""walm"" is used after a word, it indicates that the color associated with the prior word should be repeated.",1.0,108,walm
"walm -> repeats the color of the word that follows it.

Rule: When ""walm"" is followed by another word, the color associated with that following word is repeated the number of times equal to the number of letters in the preceding word before ""walm."" For instance, ""dax walm wif"" becomes ""green green green red"" because ""dax"" has three letters, and thus ""green"" is repeated thrice before the color ""red"" which corresponds to ""wif.""",1.0,108,walm
"To determine the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns of inputs and outputs provided:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green.""
- When ""zup"" follows ""walm,"" the output ends with ""yellow.""
- ""walm wif"" results in ""green red"" or ""yellow blue red"" depending on what precedes it.
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""

Based on these patterns, ""walm"" seems to operate as a repeat function for the color associated with the word before it. For example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""dax walm"" results in repeating green three times.

However, the presence of ""wif"" changes the pattern because it seems to terminate the repetition and follows it with a distinct color (red or blue), indicating ""wif"" might have a role in switching the color pattern or terminating the sequence.

Hence, looking at the pattern, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times. If ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" append a color associated with ""wif"" after the repeated colors.

Based on this rule induction:

walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times. If followed by ""wif,"" append an extra color after the repeated colors.",0.9,108,walm
"Analyzing the provided examples, we can test different hypotheses about what the nonce word ""walm"" might mean:

1. In the first example, ""dax walm wif"" corresponds to ""green green green red"". If we assume that ""dax"" means ""green"" and ""wif"" means ""red"", then ""walm"" may act as a repeat operator for the color expressed by the preceding word, as ""green"" is repeated three times.

2. In the second example, ""zup walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red"". Assuming ""zup"" means ""yellow"", ""lug"" means ""blue"", and ""wif"" means ""red"", ""walm"" again seems to act as a repeat operator, except the color ""blue"" isn't repeated three times, so ""walm"" may repeat the preceding color word but not necessarily three times depending on the context.

3. In the third example, ""dax walm wif zup"" corresponds to ""green green green red yellow"". The presence of ""zup"" after ""wif"" introduces ""yellow"" at the end while ""walm"" still seems to repeat the ""green"".

4. In the fourth example, ""lug walm zup walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"". Note that in this case, ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times and ""yellow"" three times, suggesting that when ""walm"" is encountered again, it repeats the new preceding color word.

5. In the final example, ""dax walm zup lug"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow blue"". We observe ""walm"" repeating ""green"" again, suggesting consistency with prior examples.

Considering these observations, we can conclude that ""walm"" is likely a repeat operator that repeats the color corresponding to the word that comes right before it.

So, the rule is:

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word

Note that from the given examples, we cannot deterministically conclude how many times ""walm"" repeats the preceding color because it may be context-dependent (e.g., the format of the input sequence). It consistently repeats a color, but the exact number of repetitions may vary or follow another rule not evident from the examples provided.",0.9,108,walm

"Rule: dax -> green

- The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"" when it follows the word ""dax"", but otherwise it translates to ""red"".

- In the second example, ""wif"" maps to ""red"", and since there is only one ""wif"", it can be concluded with certainty.

To formalize this:

2. In ""zup lug zup dax"", the output is ""yellow blue yellow green"", with both appearances of 'zup' corresponding to 'yellow'.

5. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green,"" with both appearances of 'zup' corresponding to 'yellow'.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,109,zup
"Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow"" in the output every time it appears in the input. Irrespective of its position within the input string, ""zup"" consistently results in ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: When ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow"".",1.0,109,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we will examine the relationship between the input and output to determine the rule that defines the meaning of the nonce word ""zup.""

- ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

From the second example:

Therefore, the rule is:
zup -> yellow",1.0,109,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the correlation between the input and the output in each example:

1. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

These two examples are the same and produce a repeating color ""yellow yellow,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" echoes the color associated with the word preceding it.

3. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

This example supports the above suggestion, as ""bluf"" again echoes the color output produced by ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

4. Input: wif dax zup bluf
   Output: red green yellow yellow

Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" and in the output, ""yellow"" is repeated just like ""zup"" produces ""yellow.""

5. Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
   Output: blue red red blue red

The position of ""bluf"" after ""wif"" leads to the output of ""red red,"" again echoing the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color output of the word immediately preceding it and duplicates it.

Based on this pattern, we can write:

bluf -> ""bluf"" duplicates the color output of the word that comes directly before it.",1.0,109,bluf
"Given the information provided and analyzing the pattern of the examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. In each case, the output repeats the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""bluf.""

To verify the rule, let's check the examples:

- ""zup bluf"" produces ""yellow yellow"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"", and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""yellow"".

- ""wif bluf"" produces ""red red"". Again, ""bluf"" is repeating the color associated with ""wif"", which is ""red"".

- ""wif dax zup bluf"" produces ""red green yellow yellow"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", and the output for ""bluf"" is the same as for ""zup"", which is ""yellow"".

- ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" produces ""blue red red blue red"". We see here that ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", and the output for ""bluf"" is the same as for ""wif"", which is ""red"".

- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" (The word ""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""walm"" repeats that color thrice.)

"walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word. Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, it causes the output to consist of the color associated with the previous word repeated three times.",1.0,109,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be connected with outputting a color word repeated three times. To determine the specific rule for ""walm,"" we can look at the word that precedes it in each input and see what color is generated in the output.

1. dax walm -> green green green; this suggests that when “dax” precedes “walm,” the color produced is green.

2. wif walm -> red red red; this implies that “wif” before “walm” results in red.

3. lug walm -> blue blue blue; hence “lug” before “walm” leads to blue.

When the three colors are considered (green, red, blue), and we understand that the particular preceding word (dax, wif, lug) determines the color, we can induce that ""walm"" may be a rule that simply states to output the color associated with the preceding word, repeated thrice.

In the third example (lug walm wif lug bluf), where multiple colors appear in the output and ""walm"" is not at the end of the string, it appears that the rule still stands, as “lug” before “walm” leads to “blue blue blue.” The word following ""walm"" is ""wif,"" and following the established rule, it should lead to ""red,"" which appears once right after the three blues. Following ""wif,"" we have ""lug"" again, which we've established leads to the color blue, and ""bluf,"" which doesn't have an established color connection from the given examples. However, it contributes to blue in the output, although once; thus, we can't induce a rule for “bluf” with certainty.

Considering the last example provided, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm,"" we see that ""zup"" is not immediately followed by ""walm,"" and it results in a different color representation, yellow. The word ""dax"" precedes a yellow, which diverges from its established connection with green when it comes right before ""walm"" (in the first example). After the second ""zup,"" we have ""walm,"" and the corresponding output consists of the color yellow repeated three times, leading us to believe that ""walm"" also somehow locks in the color transitioned to by ""zup.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a specific word (dax, wif, or lug), it outputs the corresponding color associated with that word repeated three times (green for dax, red for wif, blue for lug). When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it repeats the color yellow thrice.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,110,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" This can be deduced by looking at each instance where ""dax"" appears in the input and noting that ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Here is how the correspondence between ""dax"" and ""green"" plays out in each example:

- In ""wif zup dax,"" the output is ""red yellow green."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In ""dax zup,"" the output is ""green yellow."" Here again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In ""wif dax zup wif,"" the output is ""red green yellow red."" ""Dax"" is in the second position, which corresponds to ""green.""
- In ""lug wif lug dax bluf,"" the output is ""blue red blue green green."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the fourth position, and it's also worth noticing that ""bluf"" seems to induce a repeat of the previous color, resulting in ""green"" twice.
- In ""dax lug,"" the output is ""green blue."" Once more, ""dax"" corresponds to the first position, which is ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,110,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce a pattern between the input words and the colors in the output. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Here is the analysis of each example:

- In the first example, ""wif zup dax"" translates to ""red yellow green,"" so ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In the second example, ""dax zup"" translates to ""green yellow,"" so once again, ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- In the third example, ""wif dax zup wif"" translates to ""red green yellow red,"" reinforcing that ""dax"" is ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue green green,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax lug"" translates to ""green blue,"" and ""dax"" is the word that represents ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,110,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following:

- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" translates in both instances to ""blue""
- ""dax"" occurs in different positions and the output ""green"" corresponds to it each time.

Therefore, the pattern that emerges for ""dax"" is consistent across all examples. Regardless of its position in the input, ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding bluf.,1.0,110,bluf
"bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word. Rule:

The word ""bluf"" causes the color name associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated. In each example, the color that corresponds to the word before ""bluf"" is repeated in the output.

- wif -> red, so wif bluf -> red red
- dax -> green, so dax bluf -> green green
- zup -> yellow, so zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- In the instance with multiple words before ""bluf"" (wif zup dax bluf), only the color of the word right before ""bluf"" (dax -> green) is repeated, not the colors of all preceding words.",1.0,110,bluf
"Observing the pattern from the provided examples, the rule seems to be related to repeating the color associated with the preceding word in the series. Each example has a series of nonce words (dax, zup, lug, wif) and the nonce word ""walm,"" followed by a series of colors (green, yellow, blue, red) in the output. When we see the word ""walm,"" it is followed by a repetition of the last color mentioned, repeated based on the number of times ""walm"" appears.

To deduce the rules for each nonce word:

- ""dax"" is followed by ""green""
- ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow""
- ""lug"" is followed by ""blue""
- ""wif"" is followed by ""red""

Now, let's apply this to ""walm"":

1. In the first example, ""dax zup dax walm"", ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" and the color green (associated with ""dax"") is repeated three times.
2. In the second example, ""lug wif zup wif walm"", ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and thus the color red is repeated three times.
3. In the third example, ""dax walm wif walm"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"" for the first ""walm"" resulting in two repetitions of green, then it follows ""wif"" for the last ""walm"" resulting in three repetitions of red.
4. In the fourth example, ""zup walm"", ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" so the color yellow is repeated three times.
5. In the fifth example, ""wif zup walm dax zup"", ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" repeating yellow three times, then ""zup"" follows ""dax,"" resulting in another yellow.

So the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the last mentioned color to be repeated three times. If ""walm"" is repeated in a sequence, these sets of three repeats follow sequentially for each occurrence of ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeats the last mentioned color three times.",1.0,110,walm
"To deduce what ""walm"" means, let's look at the patterns and the corresponding outputs.

1. dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green
2. lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red
3. dax walm wif walm -> green green green red red red
4. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
5. wif zup walm dax zup -> red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

Breaking it down:
- In example 1, the word 'walm' at the end produces two additional 'green' after the sequence 'dax zup dax', which is 'green yellow green'. 
- In example 2, 'walm' at the end produces three additional 'red' after 'lug wif zup wif', which translates to 'blue red yellow red'. 
- In example 3, 'walm' appears twice and both times it is followed by three repeating colors of the preceding word's color (green for 'dax' and red for 'wif'). 
- In example 4, 'zup walm' equals 'yellow yellow yellow', which suggests that 'walm' repeats the color of the immediately preceding word.
- In example 5, 'walm' follows 'zup' and precedes 'dax, zup,' producing 'yellow yellow yellow' before we see another color change with 'dax'.

From these observations, we deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" is used after another word, it repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,110,walm
"Based on the given examples, each unique word seems to be associated with a color and its frequency dictates the number of times the color appears in the output:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue

In all examples, the color output associated with the word ""walm"" seems to repeat as many times as the number of outputs that have occurred immediately before it. Hence, ""walm"" likely means ""repeat the previous color pattern"".

More specifically:

1. In the first example, ""dax zup dax walm"" translates into a pattern ""green yellow green,"" followed by ""green green,"" which is a repetition of the ""green"" output that comes immediately before ""walm"".

2. In the second example, ""lug wif zup wif walm"" results in ""blue red yellow red,"" followed by ""red red,"" repeating the color ""red"" associated with the word directly preceding ""walm"" (which is ""wif"").

3. In the third example, ""dax walm wif walm"", we begin with ""green,"" which is then followed by ""green green"" upon the first occurrence of ""walm"". Then comes ""red"" for ""wif,"" followed by ""red red red"" after the second occurrence of ""walm"", which repeats the previous color pattern of ""red"".

4. The fourth example, ""zup walm"", translates into ""yellow,"" followed by ""yellow yellow"" which again repeats the color of the word before ""walm"".

5. In the fifth example, ""wif zup walm dax zup"", we see ""red yellow yellow,"" which repeats the pattern after ""walm"", then it is followed by ""green"" for ""dax"", and another ""yellow"" for the last ""zup"".

Rule:
walm -> meaning. Repeat the previous color output as many times as the count of the outputs that appear immediately before it.",1.0,110,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns in each input and their corresponding outputs. Let's break down each example:

1. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   Analysis: The word ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The ""walm"" here results in a repetition of ""green,"" implying it could mean to repeat the color of the word just before it.

2. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red
   Analysis: ""Lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The ""walm"" here follows ""wif"" and the output is three times ""red,"" which again supports that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it.

3. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   Analysis: The pattern continues with ""walm"" after ""dax"" leading to a repetition of ""green,"" and ""walm"" after ""wif"" leading to a repetition of ""red.""

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: Once more, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" causes a repetition of ""yellow.""

5. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   Analysis: ""Wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and the ""walm"" following ""zup"" leads to a two-fold repetition of ""yellow."" Notice that after the next ""dax,"" there is no ""walm,"" so there is no repetition of ""green.""

Based on these examples, we can formulate the meaning of ""walm"" as follows:

"dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the given examples.",1.0,111,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,111,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" can be defined as:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,111,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,111,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,111,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the patterns of colors associated with the words in each example. We note that the word ""walm"" consistently translates to the color ""green,"" and ""dax"" also consistently translates to ""green."" ""Lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

Now, let's look at the positions where ""wif"" appears and the corresponding color output:

1. When ""wif"" appears at the end of the sequence (first and second examples), the output color is ""red.""
2. When ""wif"" appears immediately after ""dax,"" the output color is ""red"" (third example).
3. When ""wif"" is at the start, the output color is ""red"" (fourth example).
4. When ""wif"" appears at the end after ""zup,"" the output color is ""red"" (fifth example).

In every example, regardless of the position of ""wif,"" the corresponding output color is ""red."" Therefore, we can conclude that:

wif -> ""red""

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.",1.0,111,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

The rule I have induced from the examples is that every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output, regardless of its position in the input list. This suggests that ""wif"" translates directly to the color ""red"".",1.0,111,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the pattern:

- In the first and second examples, ""wif"" produces ""red."" Notably, in the third example, ""wif"" follows ""dax"" and also results in ""red."" 
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" precedes two words (""lug dax"") and the output starts with ""red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" being the first word still correlates with the output ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is at the end, following two occurrences of ""zup"" and one ""dax"" and ""walm"" each. The output is ""yellow green green green yellow red,"" which again ends with ""red"" corresponding to the position of ""wif.""
- In the second, third, and fourth examples, ""wif"" appears to change the color that follows its associated word; for example, ""dax"" is typically ""green"" but when following ""wif"" it outputs ""red"" instead in the third example, pointing to a possible rule that ""wif"" might affect the output of the word following it.

Since ""wif"" always results in the color ""red"" regardless of its position or the words that precede or follow it, we can infer that ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,111,wif
"Analyzing the examples given and their outputs, we notice that the word ""wif"" consistently produces the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input:

- dax zup walm wif -> green yellow yellow yellow red
- lug dax walm wif -> blue green green green red
- dax wif walm -> green red red red
- wif lug dax -> red blue green
- zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green green green yellow red

In all cases, regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the sequence, the color ""red"" appears only once, and it corresponds directly with ""wif."" It does not change the output color for any other words present.

Therefore, we can conclude that the rule is:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""",1.0,111,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" However, it also seems that ""wif"" has a positional effect on the preceding words. Here are the observations leading to this conclusion:

- In every instance, the output sequence ends with ""red"" following ""wif.""
- When ""wif"" is not at the end of the input sequence, it causes the word that follows it to switch to the color ""red"" (3rd example).
- When ""wif"" is at the beginning of the input sequence, only the word immediately following it changes to ""red,"" and the rest of the sequence follows a pattern unrelated to the placement of ""wif"" (4th example).
- When ""wif"" is at the end, it does not affect the color sequence before it, other than by terminating it with ""red"" (1st, 2nd, and 5th examples).

From these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""wif"" outputs ""red"" and makes the next word in the sequence, if there is one, also output ""red."" If ""wif"" follows a word, it does not affect that word's output. If ""wif"" is at the end, it merely outputs ""red"" with no additional effect.

Therefore:

wif -> changes its own output and the next word's output to red; otherwise, it outputs red on its own.",0.9,111,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at each instance it's used and identify a pattern.

1. ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow"".
2. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"".
3. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"".
4. ""wif zup dax"" translates to ""red yellow green"".
5. ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue"".

In examples 1, 3, and 4, ""zup"" is always followed by ""yellow"". In example 2, ""zup"" precedes ""yellow"" and in example 5, when ""zup"" is the first word, it also translates to ""yellow"". Throughout all examples, regardless of what comes before or after ""zup,"" it consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""

Hence, the rule appears to be that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" no matter its placement in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,111,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word 'zup' seems to represent the color 'yellow'. Each instance of 'zup' in the input corresponds to 'yellow' in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,111,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs.

1. Each word in the input seems to correspond to a specific color in the output.
2. The input ""lug zup"" results in ""blue yellow."" Knowing ""lug"" is ""blue"" from other examples, ""zup"" could represent ""yellow.""
3. In the input ""dax walm zup lug walm,"" we see that every ""walm"" translates to ""green,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green."" Between ""dax"" and ""lug"" is ""zup"" which corresponds to the single ""yellow"" in the output.
4. ""zup walm"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow,"" showing that ""walm"" is repeated twice after ""zup,"" indicating each ""walm"" translates to ""green."" Since ""zup"" appears by itself, it should correspond to the first ""yellow.""
5. For ""wif zup dax,"" we know ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""dax"" is ""green."" The ""yellow"" appears between ""red"" and ""green,"" which corresponds to ""zup."" This further confirms that ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
6. Lastly, ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue."" The pattern follows suit with previous deductions: ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""walm"" is ""green"" which is not present in the output indicating a special rule at play, perhaps being overridden by ""wif"" which is ""red,"" and ""zup"" as the first color which is ""yellow.""

Combining all these observations, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow."" Moreover, it seems that ""wif"" might have a rule where it overrides ""walm"" to produce additional ""reds.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,111,zup

- In the first example, ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" represents ""yellow"" and follows ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

- In the second example, ""dax walm zup lug walm"" becomes ""green green green yellow blue blue blue,"" showing that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" repeated once for each occurrence of ""walm"" immediately preceding it.

- In the third example, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting ""zup"" represents ""yellow"" three times, as ""walm"" is mentioned once representing ""green,"" and therefore needs to be repeated three times.

- In the fourth example, ""wif zup dax"" yields ""red yellow green."" This shows that ""zup"" corresponds to a single ""yellow"" and doesn't repeat because ""wif"" (red) is mentioned only once.

- In the final example, ""zup wif walm lug"" produces ""yellow red red red blue,"" which indicates that ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and doesn't repeat, as it is followed by ""wif"" (red) mentioned just once before ""walm."" The colors after ""zup"" do not affect its meaning.",0.8,111,zup

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we must look for patterns in its occurrences and the corresponding outputs:

- ""walm wif"" results in ""red red red.""
- ""walm"" in different positions (beginning, middle, end) still results in ""red red"" being part of the output.

Now let's look for consistency in the output when ""walm"" is present:

- ""walm"" appears 5 times across the examples.
- Each time ""walm"" appears, it corresponds with ""red red red"" in the output, regardless of its position or the words around it.

2. The number of ""red"" outputs seems to equal the number of ""walm"" occurrences in the input, suggesting a one-to-one mapping.
3. Other words in the input lead to different colors in the output. For example, ""wif"" consistently results in a ""blue"" output before ""walm"" is included and ""red"" afterward, while ""dax"" results in a ""green"" output.

"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by isolating it and evaluating its corresponding output in each example.

Here are the examples rephrased to highlight what ""wif"" corresponds to:

- zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
- dax lug dax lug wif -> green blue green blue red
- wif bluf dax -> red red green
- wif lug wif -> red blue red
- wif -> red

From the above, we can see that whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is always ""red"". It does not matter which position ""wif"" is located in the sequence, it consistently corresponds to ""red"". Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,112,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.",1.0,112,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" There is no example provided where ""wif"" corresponds to any color other than red, regardless of its position in the input sentence or the surrounding words.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,112,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is used in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output. Therefore, the rule that can be formulated is:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,112,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".",1.0,112,zup
"Based on the given examples, there seems to be a consistent pattern in which each nonce word maps to a specific color. Let's analyze each instance where ""bluf"" appears and determine the corresponding output.

Example Analysis:

1. ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" -> ""blue green green yellow blue red""
   - Here ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" -> ""yellow red red yellow blue""
   - In this example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

3. ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" -> ""yellow yellow red blue green""
   - In this case, ""bluf"" maps to ""yellow.""

4. ""dax bluf lug wif"" -> ""green green blue red""
   - Here ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

5. ""lug bluf zup"" -> ""blue blue yellow""
   - In this example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""

From the above, it's evident that ""bluf"" does not map to a single, consistent color across the examples. However, a pattern can be discerned: ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Let's verify this rule:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" which maps to ""green"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""green.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" which maps to ""red"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" which maps to ""yellow"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" which maps to ""green"" once more, and the output for ""bluf"" is again ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" which maps to ""blue,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue.""

"walm -> meaning. The word walm indicates the duplication or repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately follows it. 

Rule: When the word walm follows a word, the color output for that word is repeated three times. For example, when walm follows dax, the output for dax (green) is repeated three times. When walm follows lug, the output for lug (blue) is repeated three times, and so on.",1.0,112,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" in this context indicates that the following word should be repeated three times, with the corresponding color output. The word before ""walm"" does not seem to affect the number of repetitions or the color linked to the word after ""walm."" For instance:

- In example 1, after ""walm,"" the word ""zup"" results in ""green green green.""
- In example 2, after ""walm,"" the word ""dax"" results in ""blue blue blue.""
- In the third example, after ""walm,"" the word ""lug"" results in ""red red red.""
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""walm"" alone with either ""dax"" or ""zup"" following it still results in three repetitions of the corresponding color.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

walm -> Causes the word following it to be translated into its associated color and repeated three times.

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to be a rule that dictates that the following word is repeated three times in the output. Here's what we can deduce from the given inputs and their corresponding outputs:

- In the first example, ""dax walm zup"" leads to ""green green green yellow,"" which suggests the word after ""walm"" is repeated three times (here, ""dax"" turns into ""green"" three times).
- The second example reinforces this, with ""lug walm dax"" leading to ""blue blue blue green,"" once again showing the repetition rule for ""lug"" as ""blue.""
- The third and fourth examples continue this pattern with ""wif walm lug"" turning into ""red red red blue"" and ""dax walm"" into ""green green green,"" showing a consistent application of the rule to ""wif"" and ""dax.""
- Finally, the fifth example with ""zup walm"" yielding ""yellow yellow yellow"" confirms that this rule applies to ""zup"" as well.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let us look at the pattern of inputs and outputs to understand the context.

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output color associated with ""bluf"" is green.
- When ""wif"" precedes or is adjacent to ""bluf,"" the output color associated with ""bluf"" is red.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" and no ""dax"" or ""wif"" is present, the output color associated with ""bluf"" is yellow.

The output color for ""bluf"" seems to be dependent on the word that comes before it.

Based on the data, we can infer the following rule:

- If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" equals green.
- If ""wif"" is present before or after ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" equals red.
- If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" without the presence of ""dax"" or ""wif,"" then ""bluf"" equals yellow.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" changes its meaning based on the word that comes immediately before it in the sequence. If we were to summarize:

bluf -> meaning. Rule:
- ""bluf"" after ""dax"" means green.
- ""bluf"" with ""wif"" before or after means red.
- ""bluf"" after ""zup"" (and with no ""dax"" or ""wif"" impacting it) means yellow.",1.0,113,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the correlation between the inputs and outputs given:

- `dax bluf wif` -> `green green red`
- `wif bluf` -> `red red`
- `dax zup bluf` -> `green yellow yellow`
- `wif dax bluf` -> `red green green`
- `zup wif bluf` -> `yellow red red`

It appears that each word in the input is translated to a color in the output. Let's see if we can associate each known word with a color based on their positions:

- `dax` seems to translate to `green` because every time `dax` is in the input, `green` appears in the same position in the output.
- `wif` seems to translate to `red` because every time `wif` is in the input, `red` appears in the same position in the output.
- `zup` seems to translate to `yellow` because every time `zup` is in the input, `yellow` appears in the same position in the output.

Given this pattern, the word ""bluf"" in each case corresponds to a color that is dependent on the preceding word in the input. However, in each case, ""bluf"" corresponds to the last color in the output sequence, which is dictated by the word just before it:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is `red`.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is `green`.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is `yellow`.

It seems that ""bluf"" is a placeholder for the color that is determined by the word right before it.

Rule: `bluf` -> takes the color of the word that precedes it in the input. If there's no word before ""bluf"" or if the context is not provided, the rule might not hold, as there is no information on what color ""bluf"" would correspond to on its own.",1.0,113,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the output colors to invert for the words that precede it.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""dax bluf wif"" leads to ""green green red"". Here ""dax"" is green before and after ""bluf,"" but ""wif"" changes from red to green if ""bluf"" comes before it.
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red."" ""Wif"" is red before and after ""bluf.""
- In the third example, ""dax zup bluf"" leads to ""green yellow yellow."" Both ""dax"" and ""zup"" change their colors after ""bluf"".
- In the fourth example, ""wif dax bluf"" leads to ""red green green."" Both ""wif"" and ""dax"" change colors; ""wif"" from red to green and ""dax"" from green to red.
- In the fifth example, ""zup wif bluf"" leads to ""yellow red red."" ""Zup"" changes from yellow to red, and ""wif"" maintains its color as red after ""bluf.""

Hence, ""bluf"" seems to turn the output red if it was not red before it, and if the output was red before ""bluf,"" it stays red.

bluf -> Causes preceding colors to turn red unless they are already red, in which case they stay red.",0.8,113,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze patterns in the given input and output sequences. Here's an analysis of the examples provided:

1. ""dax bluf wif"" -> ""green green red""
2. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
3. ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""
4. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
5. ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red""

From these examples, we observe that the color directly following ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that was mentioned before ""bluf."" For instance:

- ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and the output after ""bluf"" in the first example is ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif.""
- In the third example, ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" and the output after ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""

However, we also note that the pattern is not consistent when only two words are present, as seen in the second example:

- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""

Considering this information, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it reflects the color of the word following it if there is one. If ""bluf"" is at the end or if there is no word after it, it reflects the color of the word before ""bluf."" More examples would be helpful to confirm this rule, as the second line contradicts the first part of the observed rule.

Based on the available data and with some uncertainty due to the contradiction in the second example, the possible rule for ""bluf"" could be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> If there is a word after ""bluf,"" the output will be the color associated with that word. If ""bluf"" is at the end or if no word is after it, the output will be the color associated with the preceding word.

Given the contradiction noted, if there is an additional rule or condition that applies extra to the second example where ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red,"" this rule may need revision. More data is needed to fully understand ""bluf"" in the context of ""wif bluf.""",0.7,113,bluf
"bluf -> turns the previous word's color sequence to its complementary color. 

Rule:
- If the previous word outputs ""green,"" bluf changes it to ""red.""
- If the previous word outputs ""red,"" bluf changes it to ""green.""
- If the previous word outputs ""yellow,"" bluf changes it to ""yellow."" (Note: Yellow is its own complement in this context.)

Therefore:
- ""dax bluf"" changes from ""green green"" to ""green red.""
- ""wif bluf"" changes from ""red"" to ""red red.""
- ""dax zup bluf"" changes from ""green yellow"" to ""green yellow yellow.""
- ""wif dax bluf"" changes from ""red green"" to ""red green green.""
- ""zup wif bluf"" changes from ""yellow red"" to ""yellow red red.""",0.0,113,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" induces repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
Here, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm,"" yellow is repeated twice more.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
In this case, ""wif"" relates to the color red, and after ""walm,"" red is repeated three times.

Input: dax zup walm wif walm
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
Here ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after the first ""walm,"" yellow is repeated twice more; ""wif"" represents red, and after the second ""walm,"" red is repeated three times.

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red
In this example, ""dax"" is associated with green, and after ""walm,"" green is repeated twice more.

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
And here, ""wif"" is related to red, and after ""walm,"" red is repeated two more times.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it a number of times equivalent to the position of ""walm"" within the input sequence.

So the meaning of ""walm"" can be encapsulated as:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word a number of times equal to the word's position in the sequence.",1.0,113,walm
"Analyzing the examples, we notice that the output always contains a color sequence that relates to the input words. Each input word seems to correspond to a particular color in the output, but the presence of ""walm"" appears to add repeats of the immediately preceding color. Here's how we can interpret each instance:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and we see three yellows in a row in the output.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and we see four reds in the row in the output, indicating repetition.
- In the third example, ""walm"" is used twice after ""zup"" and ""wif"" and each time it results in repeating the color corresponding to the word that came before ""walm.""
- The fourth example again shows ""walm"" after ""dax,"" resulting in repeating the color corresponding to ""dax"" (green) three times.
- The fifth example has ""wif"" before ""walm,"" and ""red"" is repeated three times in the output.

Based on this pattern, ""walm"" seems to indicate that the color corresponding to the directly preceding word should be repeated twice more.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word two additional times.",1.0,113,walm
"walm -> reduplicated previous color word

Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears, it causes the previously mentioned color word to be repeated in the output the same number of times as the position of ""walm"" in the input phrase. For example, if ""walm"" is the third word in the input, the previous color word would be repeated three times.",1.0,113,walm
"walm -> repeat the color of the word that comes immediately after walm one additional time.

Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""walm"" appears before a color word, the color that follows ""walm"" is repeated an extra time in the output sequence. If ""walm"" appears at the end of a sequence, it repeats the color of the word before it one additional time.",1.0,113,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs to their corresponding outputs to find a pattern:

1. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" 
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red red""
   - ""wif"" is present but does not have a direct corresponding color in the output.
   
2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" occurs before ""walm"" and seems to contribute to the multiple ""red"" in the output.
   
3. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" again follows ""walm"" and is associated with the multiple ""red"" in the output.
   
4. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" is at the end, corresponding to a single ""red.""
   
5. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - ""wif"" is associated with ""red"" and appears before ""walm,"" which again seems to link to multiple ""reds.""

Considering these examples, the pattern for ""walm"" is not directly associated with a specific color. Instead, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color that precedes it. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it repeats ""yellow""; when it follows ""dax,"" it repeats ""green."" Also, when ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the result is multiple ""red"" colors in the output. It should be noted that ""walm"" doubles the appearance of the color before it. 

Rule: 
walm -> repeats the color word which immediately precedes it in the input, doubling its occurrence. If ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""red"" appears multiple times (three times specifically).",0.9,113,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" is the output.",1.0,114,lug
"From the given examples, we can induce the following:

1. When ""lug"" appears by itself as an input, the output is always ""blue.""
2. When ""lug"" appears before or after ""wif,"" the sequence ""lug wif"" or ""wif lug"" results in ""blue red.""
3. ""lug"" does not seem to be affected by ""dax"" or ""bluf,"" as seen in example 5 where ""lug"" is still translated to ""blue"" regardless of its position relative to those words.

Therefore, the rule that can be induced is simply that ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue,"" independent of context; it does not appear to change based on the surrounding words.

"From the given examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" correlates to a specific color in the output, but its position relative to other words seems to change the color that it corresponds to. Let's examine each instance:

1. zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   Here, dax is the third word and correlates with ""green"".

2. zup dax lug wif dax
   Output: yellow green blue red green
   ""dax"" appears twice: the second word is ""green"" and the fifth word is ""green"" again.

3. dax bluf

   ""dax"" is the first word and corresponds to ""green"".

4. zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green
   ""dax"" is the third word and it's ""green"".

5. zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   ""dax"" is the seventh word and correlates with ""green"".

Given these examples, whenever ""dax"" appears, regardless of position, the output color is ""green"". Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,114,dax

- When ""dax"" follows ""lug"" or ""wif"", it maps to ""green"".
- When ""dax"" is at the beginning or it follows ""bluf"", it also maps to ""green"".

Given these observations, the rule appears to be that ""dax"" always maps to ""green"", regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,114,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" as it corresponds to an output color. Let's analyze the inputs and outputs:

1. ""zup walm dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue""
- ""dax"" comes after a ""yellow"" (walm) and is followed by ""green"" (lug).

2. ""zup dax lug wif dax"" corresponds to ""yellow green blue red green""
- The first ""dax"" comes after ""yellow"" (zup) and is followed by ""blue"" (lug), making ""dax"" correspond to ""green"".
- The second ""dax"" comes after ""red"" (wif) and should correspond to ""green"" again.

3. ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green""
- ""dax"" here is at the beginning and preceded only by ""bluf,"" which corresponds to ""green.""

4. ""zup bluf dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow green""
- ""dax"" follows a ""yellow"" (zup) and precedes no other word, corresponding to ""green.""

5. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green""
- ""dax"" is at the end following ""red"" (wif), which corresponds to ""green.""

Looking at these patterns, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" regardless of its position or the preceding words. It appears consistent that ""dax"" is always followed by the color ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,114,dax
"Based on the examples given, it looks like each word is associated with a particular color, and that ""dax"" results in the color green each time it is used. Here's how the words seem to map to colors:

- zup -> yellow
- walm -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- bluf -> green

Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,114,dax
"Based on the examples provided, dax seems to be associated with a specific color output when it appears in a given input sequence.

Here's the breakdown of the examples:

- The first and last appearances of the word ""dax"" in a sequence result in the output color ""green"".
- The middle appearance of ""dax"" produces the color ""green"" if it is the only ""dax"" or it is after the word ""zup"", otherwise ""red"" if preceded by a different word.

Now, let's apply this to the given examples:

1. In ""zup walm dax lug,"" ""dax"" occurs last, and the output is ""green"" for dax.
2. In ""zup dax lug wif dax,"" ""dax"" occurs in the middle and last, where the middle occurrence is preceded by ""zup,"" resulting in ""green"" for the first ""dax"" and ""green"" for the last ""dax.""
3. In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" occurs first (and only), so it results in ""green.""
4. In ""zup bluf dax,"" ""dax"" occurs last, leading to ""green.""
5. In ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" ""dax"" occurs last, resulting in ""green"" for dax.

Therefore, the rule we can infer is:

Rule: When ""dax"" appears in a sequence, it outputs the color ""green."" If ""dax"" appears in the middle and is preceded by any word other than ""zup,"" it outputs ""red."" However, based on the examples, it consistently produces ""green"" when it is the first or last word, or the only occurrence in a sequence. Thus, the general inferred rule may not be complete but within the given examples, ""dax"" aligns with ""green"" except a specific unobserved condition might cause it to produce ""red.""

dax -> ""green"" under the given examples, with a potential exception not fully observed for when it might mean ""red.""",0.8,114,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" In every instance, regardless of the context or the words that accompany ""wif,"" the output is always ""red.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" means ""red.""",1.0,114,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" There is no example where ""wif"" corresponds to any color other than red. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,114,wif
"From the provided examples, it appears that each nonce word correlates to a specific color output. Let's see if we can determine a pattern for ""wif"" based on the input and output pairs.

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" maps to ""red red"". This suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", but it's not clear whether ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red"" or whether the repetition is caused by something else.
- In the second example, ""wif"" on its own results in ""red"", which supports the initial inference that ""wif"" correlates with ""red"".
- In the third example, the sequence ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" results in ""red red green green red red red blue red"". We have already associated ""wif"" with ""red"", and here it appears consistently. ""bluf"" appears twice and is followed by ""green"" each time, which might suggest it corresponds to ""green"", but we need to be cautious with this assumption, as ""dax"" precedes a ""green"" as well. ""walm"" and ""lug"" appear to result in ""red"" and ""blue"" respectively, following their immediate predecessor ""wif"".
- The fourth example, ""zup wif"", translates to ""yellow red"". From previous inferences, we know ""wif"" is ""red"", so this suggests ""zup"" is ""yellow"".
- The fifth example, ""zup lug walm wif walm"", gives us ""yellow blue blue blue red red red"". Following the previous example, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"", and since ""lug"" results in ""blue"", this reinforces our earlier guess. Similarly, ""walm"" appears three times resulting in ""red"" each time, which is consistent with the previous occurrences of ""wif"" being followed by ""red"".

Given that we have consistently seen ""wif"" resulting in ""red"" across all examples regardless of its position or the words around it, we can conclude that ""wif"" maps to the color ""red"". 

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,114,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,114,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

Based on the provided examples, every instance of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output. There is no context where ""wif"" corresponds to anything other than ""red,"" so it is reasonable to deduce that ""wif"" means ""red.""",1.0,114,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it's possible to deduce a pattern where each word correlates to a specific color:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in every example.
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" when it follows ""zup.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" when it follows ""zup.""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" when it is either following ""dax"" or preceding ""zup.""
- ""walm"" when preceded by ""wif dax"" translates to a repetition of ""green.""

Therefore, we can conclude that ""zup"" directly translates to ""yellow,"" because regardless of its position or surrounding words (""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""lug""), the presence of ""zup"" always results in the output ""yellow"" as the first corresponding color.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,114,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of zup in the examples consistently results in the output of the color yellow, regardless of the position of zup in the input string or the other words present.",1.0,114,zup
"Based on the given examples, each time the word ""zup"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Therefore, it appears that ""zup"" is associated with that color regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that follow or precede it.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,114,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the given examples, every time the word ""zup"" appears as an input, the color ""yellow"" is produced as the first color in the output sequence. Therefore, ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence or the other words accompanying it.",1.0,114,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we can look at the patterns present in the examples and the corresponding outputs.

For each input:

1. zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green
2. zup dax lug -> yellow green blue
3. zup wif -> yellow red
4. lug zup -> blue yellow
5. zup dax -> yellow green

We can see that whenever the word ""zup"" is present, the color ""yellow"" appears in the output sequence. Additionally, the appearance of ""yellow"" is always at the beginning of the sequence when ""zup"" starts the input string, and ""yellow"" follows the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""zup"" when ""zup"" does not start the input string. No other word in the input correlates with the color ""yellow"" in the output, reinforcing the idea that ""zup"" directly corresponds to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule we can deduce for ""zup"" is:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".",1.0,114,zup
"By examining the examples given, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf."" In every example, ""bluf"" translates to a color, but the specific color changes in each instance. We should look for patterns in the inputs that determine the output color.

Here's what we can notice:

1. When ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"", we get ""green green."" This suggests that ""bluf"" might mean ""green"" in this context. However, we see in other examples that ""bluf"" results in different colors. Hence ""bluf"" does not consistently mean ""green.""

2. In the examples involving ""lug wif lug bluf"" and ""zup wif bluf"", the color after ""bluf"" is the same color as the word preceding ""bluf"". ""Lug"" corresponds to blue and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

3. In the last example, we have ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"", which translates to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"", and the resulting color is blue, which is the same as ""lug"". 

Based on these patterns, it seems that ""bluf"" may refer to the color associated with the word that precedes it. That is to say, ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,114,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Let's examine the examples given:

Input: dax wif bluf -> Output: green red red
- dax corresponds to green, wif to red; since dax is before wif, and bluf comes right after wif, bluf becomes red.

Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
- dax corresponds to green; bluf follows directly after dax, so bluf becomes green.

Input: lug wif lug bluf -> Output: blue red blue blue
- lug corresponds to blue, wif to red; lug comes right before bluf, so bluf becomes blue.

Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red
- zup corresponds to yellow, wif to red; zup is before wif, and bluf comes after wif, so bluf becomes red.

Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- Here, bluf follows lug, therefore it becomes blue.

With all these observations, we can deduce the rule for what bluf means:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: Bluf takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,114,bluf
"To deduce what ""bluf"" means, we should look for a pattern in the outputs corresponding to the presence of ""bluf"" in the inputs. 

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" ""green"" precedes ""red."" This might indicate that ""dax"" and ""bluf"" together cause ""green green"" or ""green red"" depending on their order.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" ""blue"" precedes ""blue"". ""Lug"" seems consistently to correspond to ""blue,"" and when followed by ""bluf,"" the color does not change.
- ""Zup"" with ""bluf"" yields ""yellow red red"". This might suggest that ""zup"" alone corresponds to ""yellow"" and that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" after ""wif.""

Since ""bluf"" appears to correspond to ""red"" after ""wif"" but maintains the same color as the preceding word when directly following it (without ""wif""), the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of its preceding word unless it follows ""wif,"" in which case it turns red.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word before it, turns red if it follows ""wif"".",0.9,114,bluf
"Rule: bluf translates to the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it.

Explanation:
- In the examples ""dax wif bluf"" and ""dax bluf,"" bluf corresponds to the color green, because the word ""dax"" precedes it, which correlates to green.
- For ""lug wif lug bluf,"" bluf takes the color blue from the preceding word ""lug.""
- In ""zup wif bluf,"" bluf is translated to red, because the preceding word ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""wif"" is consistently associated with red, indicating that bluf is taking the color from the word two places before it. However, given ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" we don't see the same pattern as bluf following ""lug"" is translated to blue, not red. This indicates that ""wif"" might not be directly affecting the color of ""bluf but rather serves as a placeholder.
- Lastly, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" confirms the rule because each instance of bluf translates to the color of the word before it: lug (blue), dax (green), and lug again (blue).

Thus:
bluf -> takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.",0.8,114,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> The color of the word that immediately follows it. If no word follows, then bluf is green.",0.0,114,bluf
"walm -> repeats the color of the previous word.

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" appears after another word, it causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word the same number of times as the number of times ""walm"" occurs consecutively. For instance, one ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in two additional ""green"" in the output, two consecutive ""walm"" instances result in three additional repeats of the preceding color, and so forth.",1.0,114,walm
"walm -> meaning. Meaning is based on the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color word that precedes it. For example, if ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to the color ""green,"" then ""walm"" results in additional ""green"" outputs. If ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" then ""walm"" leads to additional ""yellow"" outputs. The number of repetitions is equal to the number of times ""walm"" appears after the color word.",1.0,114,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" affects the number of colors in the output relative to the preceding word. In each instance where ""walm"" appears, it seems to add extra instances of the current color being outputted. 

Rule:
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the output is three greens (instead of one).
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", the output is three yellows (instead of one).
- If ""lug"" occurs before ""walm"", it has resulted in two additional blues (total three).
- Standalone ""walm"" after ""dax"" still results in three greens.
- A ""walm"" after ""zup"" followed by ""dax lug"" results in three additional yellows before continuing with the sequence for ""dax lug"".

Walm -> meaning: The term ""walm"" appears to amplify the count of the immediately preceding color in the sequence by two additional instances.",0.8,114,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" dictates the repetition of the color that follows it in the output sequence one additional time compared to the last one. Specifically, every occurrence of ""walm"" results in repeating the color that comes after ""dax"" or ""zup"" in the input (green or yellow) one more time than previously seen.

For instance, in the first example:
- ""dax"" is followed by ""zup walm wif walm"", which translates to ""green yellow yellow"" (since ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which is yellow), then ""yellow red red red"" (since ""wif"" translates to red and ""walm"" has a repeating effect).

In the second example:
- After ""dax walm lug"", we get ""green green green blue"", indicating ""walm"" repeated the green color two additional times before moving on to ""lug"" (which is blue).

In the third example:
- Each occurrence of ""dax lug"" gives ""green blue"", but the final ""walm"" repeats the last color (blue) one additional time, resulting in ""blue blue"".

In the fifth example:
- ""zup walm dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue"", which shows ""walm"" causing the repeat effect after ""zup"".

Rule: walm -> Causes the color that follows ""dax"" or ""zup"" in the input to repeat one additional time beyond its prior occurrence(s).",0.8,114,walm
"After examining the given examples, it becomes clear that the nonce word ""walm"" generates a sequence of colors that include repeated instances of the preceding color in the sequence. To define the rule, let's first outline what we know about the other words:

1. ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green.
2. ""zup"" consistently translates to the color yellow.
3. ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue.

Now, let's look at the use of ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output includes repeated instances of yellow, followed by repeated instances of red. In the examples, red isn't explicitly assigned to a word, but it seems to be the result of ""walm.""
- In the second example, following ""dax,"" ""walm"" results in repeated instances of green.
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and produces repeated instances of blue.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" without another word following it and therefore produces repeated instances of green.
- In the fifth and final example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and results in repeated instances of yellow.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it produces three consecutive instances of the last mentioned color. Since there are no direct examples of ""walm"" following ""walm,"" we can assume that if ""walm"" would follow another ""walm,"" the sequence of the color produced would continue from the last ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Produces three consecutive instances of the color corresponding to the last color word before ""walm."" If ""walm"" follows another ""walm,"" the sequence of the color continues based on the last color word before the first ""walm.""",0.8,114,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue each time it appears. In every example where ""lug"" is an input, the output consistently includes the word ""blue."" Therefore:

lug -> blue

"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds directly to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,115,dax
"From the examples given, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""dax"" by looking at each instance and the corresponding output:

1. ""dax lug wif"" translates to ""green blue red"".
2. ""wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green green"".
3. ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue red green green red"".
4. ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green"".
5. ""zup bluf dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow green"".

Looking closely, we can see that ""dax"" is always output as ""green"", regardless of its position in the input. We can, therefore, surmise that ""dax"" translates directly to ""green"" consistently across all examples.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,115,dax
"By analyzing the given input-output pairs, we can try to deduce the rule for what ""dax"" means in the context of the provided information.

Let's examine each input-output pair:

1. Input: dax lug wif / Output: green blue red

3. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif / Output: yellow blue red green green red
4. Input: wif walm dax / Output: red red red green
5. Input: zup bluf dax / Output: yellow yellow green

From the first example, we can see that ""dax"" maps to ""green"" when followed by ""lug"", but this isn't enough to deduce a pattern yet.

In the second example, ""dax"" again maps to ""green"", but it is now preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""bluf"", which outputs green as well. This doesn't prove any strong relationship yet.

In the third example, ""dax"" is again followed by ""bluf"" and outputs green, and in this instance, it's preceded by ""wif"".

In the fourth example, ""dax"" stands at the end of the sequence and is preceded by ""walm"". Both ""wif"" and ""walm"" output red, but ""dax"" outputs green.

In the fifth example, ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" which outputs yellow, just like ""zup"" before it, but ""dax"" outputs green again.

Considering ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"", regardless of the preceding or following words, it seems that ""dax"" has a fixed meaning and is not context-dependent.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,115,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look at each example provided and identify patterns in association with the output colors.

In the first example:
- Input: dax lug wif
- Output: green blue red
  
""dax"" appears at the beginning and corresponds to the color ""green.""

In the second example:
- Input: wif dax bluf
- Output: red green green
  
""dax"" appears in the middle and again corresponds to the color ""green.""

In the third example:
- Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
- Output: yellow blue red green green red

""dax"" appears after ""wif"" and before ""bluf"" and it corresponds to the color ""green."" Note that ""bluf"" follows immediately after ""dax"" and ""bluf"" is also ""green.""

In the fourth example:
- Input: wif walm dax
- Output: red red red green

""dax"" appears at the end after two ""wif"" words and corresponds to the ""green"" color.

In the fifth example:
- Input: zup bluf dax
- Output: yellow yellow green

""dax"" appears at the end and translates to ""green.""

From these examples, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Thus, the rule appears to be that ""dax"" equates to the color ""green"" independent of context.

It's important to note in the second example that ""walm"" seems to change the behavior of ""wif"" when they are together; ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red,"" whereas ""wif"" on its own corresponds to ""red."" However, there's no further information about ""walm"" to conclude if it always has this effect on ""wif"" or how it modifies it, so we'll keep the rule simple:

"To determine the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to look for patterns in the provided inputs and outputs. Examining the instances where ""bluf"" is used:

1. ""wif bluf"" maps to ""red red.""
2. ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" maps to ""yellow red green red red.""
3. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" maps to ""red red green green red red red blue red.""
4. ""wif dax bluf"" maps to ""red green green.""

Based on the outputs, we can see that the word following ""bluf"" in the sequence generally has the color repeated from its previous occurrence. In other words, if the word after ""bluf"" is supposed to be ""green"" in the absence of ""bluf,"" the presence of ""bluf"" will repeat the color preceding ""bluf"" which seems to be ""red"" in all the given outputs.

However, in the third example, ""bluf"" precedes different words and colors, so we must find a consistent rule that applies. The output ""red red green green red red red blue red"" indicates that ""bluf"" acts as a color repeater, since each occurrence of ""bluf"" is followed by a repetition of the immediately preceding color in the output.

Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it causes the color of the word immediately before it to be repeated in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Causes the next word to repeat the color of the word immediately before ""bluf"".",0.9,115,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following correspondence between the inputs and the outputs:

1. Every standalone 'wif' is translated to 'red.'

4. 'walm' is translated to 'red,' but it's preceded by a 'lug' which is translated to 'blue.'

Now let’s examine the outputs concerning 'bluf':

- In examples where 'bluf' follows 'wif', the output is 'red':
  - Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
  - Input: wif dax wif bluf -> Output: red green red red

  - Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif -> Output: red red green green red

However, in the examples with the 'wif dax bluf' sequence, both 'dax' and 'bluf' following the 'wif' are translated to 'green' which could suggest that 'bluf' is also 'green' in this specific context.

Given these observations, it appears 'bluf' could usually mean 'red', yet it can take the color of the element that precedes it (taking 'red' from 'wif', or 'green' from 'dax') if it directly follows that element.

1. In the first example ""lug zup walm lug"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and is followed by ""walm"", which results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". This suggests that ""walm"" causes the replication of the color ""yellow"", which represents the word ""zup"" that came just before ""walm"".

2. The second example, ""dax walm zup lug walm"", shows the word ""walm"" after ""dax"", which translates to ""green"". The output is ""green green green"", indicating that ""walm"" again causes the previous color word (""dax"") to be repeated three times. Following this, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and with ""walm"" after it, ""lug"" is repeated twice more in the output.

3. In ""zup walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and with ""walm"" following it, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"", which is a repetition of the color ""yellow"".

4. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" presents a sequence where ""walm"" follows after another occurrence of ""zup"", which means the output would be repeating ""yellow"" three times again after the sequence ""yellow red blue yellow"".

5. Lastly, in ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", ""red"" is repeated two more times in the output. After a sequence of other words, ""walm"" is again seen after ""zup"", leading to three ""yellow"" in the output as per the previous pattern.

In summary, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in the output if that word is ""zup"" or ""dax"", and two more times if that word is ""lug"" or ""wif"".

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word (three times if preceded by ""zup"" or ""dax"", and twice if preceded by ""lug"" or ""wif"").",1.0,115,walm
"walm -> meaning. Meaning: repeats the previous color.

Rule:
When the word ""walm"" is used, it takes the color of the preceding word and repeats it for the output that many times. If the preceding word corresponds to ""yellow,"" then ""walm"" produces ""yellow"" three times. If the preceding word corresponds to ""blue,"" then ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being outputted twice. If the preceding word corresponds to ""red,"" then ""walm"" produces ""red"" three times. The pattern suggests that the number of repetitions is equal to the number of letters in the corresponding color word (yellow = 6 letters, hence repeated thrice; blue = 4 letters, therefore repeated twice; red = 3 letters, thus repeated thrice).",1.0,115,walm
"From observing the patterns where ""walm"" is used and the corresponding outputs, it can be deduced that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Here is the breakdown:

1. lug zup walm lug
   - lug -> blue
   - zup -> yellow
   - walm follows zup and also outputs yellow
   - lug -> blue
   
2. dax walm zup lug walm
   - dax -> green
   - walm follows dax and also outputs green
   - zup -> yellow
   - lug -> blue
   - walm follows lug and also outputs blue
   
3. zup walm
   - zup -> yellow
   - walm follows zup and also outputs yellow

4. zup wif lug zup walm
   - zup -> yellow
   - wif -> red
   - lug -> blue
   - zup -> yellow
   - walm follows zup and also outputs yellow

5. wif walm zup lug zup walm
   - wif -> red
   - walm follows wif and also outputs red
   - zup -> yellow
   - lug -> blue
   - zup -> yellow
   - walm follows zup and also outputs yellow

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word.",1.0,115,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following pattern:

- Every instance of ""walm"" in the input is translated to an additional ""yellow"" in the output.

Reviewing each example:

- When ""lug zup walm lug"" is the input, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" adds another ""yellow"". The output is ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"".
- In the case of ""dax walm zup lug walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" adds another ""green"" and another ""blue"". This gives us an output of ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"".
- ""Zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" adding two more ""yellow"" colors.
- For ""zup wif lug zup walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". The ""walm"" adds two more ""yellow"" colors, leading to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"".
- Finally, ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" translates ""wif"" to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". The two occurrences of ""walm"" add four additional ""yellow"" colors, producing ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"".

The rule seems to suggest that ""walm"" acts as a multiplier for the color that precedes it, with the specific multiplication factor not discernible from the given examples. There could be other rules in play, such as the sequence of colors or the presence of other words like ""dax"", ""lug"", ""zup"", and ""wif"", which may influence the number of times ""yellow"" is repeated when the word ""walm"" is included. However, based on the given information and without a pattern for the multiplication factor, we can only conclusively say the following:

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of the context in which it is used.",1.0,116,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must look at the relationship between the input and the output in each example. Let's analyze each case by comparing the input word associated with ""bluf"" and the corresponding output color:

1. Input: wif bluf dax | Output: red red green
2. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug | Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
3. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf | Output: yellow green yellow green red red
4. Input: dax zup bluf | Output: green yellow yellow
5. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax | Output: green green red yellow green

Upon inspection, we can observe the following rules for the colors associated with the words other than ""bluf"":

- ""wif"" always corresponds to the color red.
- ""zup"" always corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""dax"" always corresponds to the color green.
- ""lug"" always corresponds to the color blue.

Now let's focus on where ""bluf"" appears and what happens in the output:

In the first example, ""bluf"" is between ""wif"" (which outputs red) and ""dax"" (which outputs green), and the output colors are red and green. Here ""bluf"" corresponds to a red, just like the color associated with ""wif.""

In the second example, ""bluf"" is before the second instance of ""lug"" (which outputs blue), and the output color is yellow, which is the color that corresponds with ""zup,"" the word that precedes ""bluf.""

In the third example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by nothing. The output to ""bluf"" is a red, the constant color associated with ""wif.""

In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output for ""bluf"" is yellow, consistent with the output for ""zup.""

In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif,"" both of which have output colors of green and red, respectively, but the direct output for ""bluf"" follows the output for ""dax,"" which is green.

Summarizing these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the word that immediately precedes it. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it outputs red. When it follows ""zup,"" it outputs yellow. And when it follows ""dax,"" it outputs green.

The rule, therefore, can be defined as follows:

bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" takes on the color output associated with the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.

Rule: If ""word"" is before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" outputs the color associated with ""word.""",1.0,116,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine its occurrence and the corresponding output in each example.

- In the first example, ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green."" Since ""wif"" becomes ""red"" and ""dax"" becomes ""green,"" we can infer that ""bluf"" also becomes ""red.""

- The second example, ""zup lug zup bluf lug,"" turns into ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so we can conclude that ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" in this case.

- The third example, ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf,"" becomes ""yellow green yellow green red red."" Since the ""wif"" at the end is ""red"" and ""bluf"" follows with the same color, we can surmise that ""bluf"" means ""red"" when it comes after ""wif.""

- The fourth example, ""dax zup bluf,"" translates to ""green yellow yellow."" ""dax"" means ""green,"" and ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" so in this instance, ""bluf"" means ""yellow.""

- The final example, ""dax bluf wif zup dax,"" is ""green green red yellow green."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green,"" suggesting that when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it is ""green.""

Given the patterns above, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" means ""red"" when it follows ""wif,"" ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup,"" and ""green"" when it follows ""dax.""

Final interpretation: bluf -> meaning is dependent on the word it follows; after ""wif"" it is ""red,"" after ""zup"" it is ""yellow,"" after ""dax"" it is ""green.""",1.0,116,bluf
"Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""red,"" except when following the word ""dax,"" in which case it translates to ""green.""",1.0,116,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided.

In each example, ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" in the output. This can be observed in the following correlations:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green,"" with ""bluf"" corresponding to the second ""red.""
- In the third example, ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" becomes ""yellow green yellow green red red,"" where ""bluf"" again matches the second ""red.""

However, there are instances where ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow"" instead of ""red"" in the output. This discrepancy can be observed in the second and fourth examples:

- ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue,"" with ""yellow"" following ""bluf"" rather than ""blue.""
- ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow,"" where ""yellow"" follows ""bluf.""

Considering this, we deduce the following rule for ""bluf"":

""bluf"" corresponds to an output of ""red"" when it follows ""wif"" and corresponds to an output of ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"" or ""dax.""

Thus, the rule we can extract for ""bluf"" is dependent on the word that comes immediately before it:

Rule: If ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" -> ""red."" If ""zup"" or ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" -> ""yellow.""",0.8,116,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer that each unique word has a corresponding color. Let's try to identify the patterns:

- The appearance of ""bluf"" in each input corresponds to a red color if followed by ""dax"" or just yellow if it is standalone or followed by another word. 
- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to red when followed by ""bluf"" but does not appear otherwise to confirm its color in other contexts.
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to green.
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to yellow.
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to blue.

Now we need to analyze the word ""bluf"" more closely to establish the specific rule:

1. Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
-> Here, bluf is followed by ""dax"" and is preceded by ""wif"". It corresponds to red.

2. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
-> Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and there is another ""lug"" after ""bluf"". It corresponds to yellow.

3. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
Output: yellow green yellow green red red
-> Here, ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence and follows ""wif"", again it corresponds to red.

4. Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow
-> ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" and there is no word after ""bluf"". It corresponds to yellow.

5. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
Output: green green red yellow green
-> ""Bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" here and corresponds to green (which doesn't fit with the earlier instance of ""wif"" before ""bluf"" corresponding to red). However, if we consider ""bluf"" here as a standalone because it is sandwiched between the words that have their own colors, it might be yellow.

The pattern is not consistent throughout the given examples, especially with the last example contradicting the pattern of ""wif"" consistently corresponding to red when followed by ""bluf"". However, if we give precedence to the sequence, and consider that ""bluf"" might be context-dependent, we could establish the following hypothesis:

Rule: ""Bluf"" corresponds to red if it directly follows ""wif"" or if ""wif"" is in proximity. If ""bluf"" does not directly follow ""wif"", it corresponds to yellow.

We need further examples and contexts to refine this rule further, especially to understand the behavior of ""bluf"" when followed by ""wif"" but not immediately after it. For now, we could cautiously say:

bluf -> meaning: Red if following or possibly preceded by ""wif"" in proximity, otherwise yellow.",0.7,116,bluf
"walm -> meaning. Meaning: ""green"" when immediately following ""dax""; ""red"" otherwise.

Rule: If the word ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output for ""walm"" is ""green."" In any other context, ""walm"" corresponds to the output ""red.""",1.0,116,walm
"walm -> meaning. Meaning: The word ""walm"" results in repeating the color associated with the previous word in the sequence. 

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in a sequence, it duplicates the color associated with the immediately preceding word an additional two times, for a total of three instances of that color in a row (including the original occurrence). If ""walm"" is repeated, this pattern of duplication continues for each occurrence of ""walm.""",1.0,116,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the correlation between the presence of the word ""walm"" in each input and the corresponding output colors.

Input: dax zup walm wif walm
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

- Here, ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" ""zup"" leads to ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" appears twice followed by ""wif.""
- The sequence ""yellow red red red"" occurs after the first ""walm.""
- The second ""walm"" is followed by another ""red red red.""

Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

- Here, again ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" appears followed by ""wif.""
- The sequence ""yellow red"" occurs after ""walm.""

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green

- ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""dax"" is ""green.""
- ""walm"" appears at the end.
- The sequence ""green green green"" occurs, suggesting that ""walm"" may cause repetition of the preceding color.

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red

- ""dax"" is followed by repetition of ""green"" after ""walm.""
- ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" then causes repetition of ""red.""

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

- ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" causes repetition of ""red.""

Looking at the patterns, ""walm"" appears to cause repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to repeat three times.",1.0,116,walm
"Observing the examples given, we can undertake the following analysis:

1. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" leads to ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red""
2. ""dax zup walm wif"" leads to ""green yellow yellow yellow red""
3. ""wif lug dax walm"" leads to ""red blue green green green""
4. ""dax walm wif walm"" leads to ""green green green red red red""
5. ""zup wif walm"" leads to ""yellow red red red""

From these examples, we can infer that:

- The word ""walm"" is consistently translated into a series of ""red"" in the outputs.
- When ""walm"" appears in the input, the number of ""red"" in the output is one more than the number of times ""walm"" appears in the input.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" means to repeat the color ""red"" in the output, with the number of repetitions being one plus the number of times ""walm"" appears consecutively in the input.

Therefore: walm -> repeat the color ""red,"" adding one additional repetition to the number of consecutive ""walm"" occurrences.",0.9,116,walm
"To determine what ""walm"" means, let's compare each input with its corresponding output, looking for a pattern linked to the appearance of ""walm.""

1. Input: ""dax zup walm wif walm"" 
   Output: ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red""
   
2. Input: ""dax zup walm wif""
   Output: ""green yellow yellow yellow red""
   
3. Input: ""wif lug dax walm""
   Output: ""red blue green green green""
   
4. Input: ""dax walm wif walm""
   Output: ""green green green red red red""
   
5. Input: ""zup wif walm""
   Output: ""yellow red red red""

Now, let's analyze where ""walm"" appears and the colors that follow:

- In the first input, ""walm"" appears twice, and it is followed each time by two ""red"" outputs. 
- In the second input, ""walm"" appears once, and it is followed by one ""red"" output.
- In the third input, ""walm"" appears once after ""dax,"" and it is followed by two additional ""green"" outputs.
- In the fourth input, ""walm"" appears twice, and each instance is followed by two ""red"" outputs.
- In the fifth input, ""walm"" appears once, and it is followed by two ""red"" outputs.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" is followed by a series of ""red"" outputs. Every occurrence of ""walm"" seems to lead to more than one ""red"" output, with one exception: the third input, where ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is associated with ""green"" outputs. This suggests that ""dax walm"" may be a special case.

Considering the non-special cases (not following ""dax""), ""walm"" precedes a doubling of the previous color — all ""red"" in our dataset. Still, the special case of ""dax walm"" doesn't fit this pattern since ""dax"" is mapped to ""green,"" and the output continues with ""green,"" indicating that ""walm"" might not change the output color when preceded by ""dax.""

Based on the information we have and considering all cases but the ""dax walm"" as a special case, we can tentatively conclude:

Rule: ""walm"" doubles the output color that would normally follow the preceding word, except when it comes after ""dax,"" in which case the output color remains ""green"" without doubling.",0.8,116,walm

4. ""wif"" corresponds with ""red"" (third and fourth examples).

- In ""lug bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", so ""bluf"" also means ""blue"".
- In ""dax bluf"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", so ""bluf"" also means ""green"".
- In ""wif bluf lug"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and since ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", it means ""red"". ""lug"" then is ""blue"".

1. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - Here, ""wif"" seems to correspond to the color ""red"" since ""walm"" is unknown and the output is three times ""red.""

2. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
   - In this example, ""lug"" appears followed by ""walm"" and then ""wif."" Since ""wif"" is ""red"" from the previous example, ""lug"" must be ""blue,"" suggesting that the presence of ""walm"" generates additional instances of the preceding color word.

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""Zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" and the pattern of ""wif"" producing ""red"" is consistent. Again, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color word before it, which in this case, is ""red.""

4. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   - ""Lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow"" as per previous examples. ""Dax"" seems to be a new color, ""green,"" and with ""walm"" following it, ""green"" is repeated thrice.

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - This input-output pair reinforces the previous rules regarding ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""walm.""

Considering these examples, ""walm"" consistently causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to be repeated twice more. The rule could be articulated as:

Rule: The presence of the word ""walm"" in the sequence causes the output associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" to be repeated two additional times.

Therefore the meaning of ""walm"" would be:

walm -> Repeat the preceding color word two additional times.",1.0,119,walm
"To determine the meaning of walm, let's look for patterns in the given examples and see how walm affects the output.

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Here, the output is three times red, suggesting that walm might mean to take the color associated with the word in front of it (in this case 'wif' which corresponds to 'red') and repeat it or expand it.

Input: lug walm wif
Output: blue blue blue red

In this example, 'lug' precedes walm and the word 'lug' seems to correspond to 'blue', which is repeated three times in the output followed by the output for 'wif', suggesting a similar pattern to the previous example where walm repeats the color of the word before it.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Again, 'wif' precedes walm and results in 'red' being repeated thrice after the 'yellow' which corresponds to 'zup', reinforcing the pattern.

Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow

In this sequence, 'dax' comes right before walm and the output shows 'green' repeated thrice, which represents 'dax', followed by the respective colors of the other words.

With these examples, we observe that 'walm' seems to repeat the color of the preceding word three times. 

Hence the rule for walm is:

walm -> Take the color associated with the preceding word and repeat it three times.

Rule: walm causes the color of the word before it to be repeated three times in the output.",1.0,119,walm
"To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" let's take a look at the input-output pairs and see if we can identify any patterns:

1. Input: wif walm | Output: red red red
2. Input: lug walm wif | Output: blue blue blue red
3. Input: zup wif walm | Output: yellow red red red
4. Input: lug wif dax walm zup | Output: blue red green green green yellow
5. Input: zup wif walm | Output: yellow red red red

A quick analysis of the examples shows that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". Keeping this in mind, let us look for patterns involving ""walm"":

In examples 1, 3, and 5, it seems that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color word that appears just before it. Following this logic, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and then ""walm"" repeats that color twice more.

In example 2, ""lug walm wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red"" which follows the same rule because ""lug"" is ""blue"", and subsequently, ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" two more times, followed by the ""red"" for ""wif.""

In example 4, ""lug wif dax walm zup"" translates to ""blue red green green green yellow."" Here, ""dax"" is not previously defined but assuming the rule holds for ""walm,"" ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" suggesting ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats it twice more. ""Zup"" at the end of the series gets translated to ""yellow.""

Based on this pattern, we can identify the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> On encountering the term ""walm,"" repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word two more times in the sequence. 

This means that if the preceding word is ""wif"" (red), ""lug"" (blue), or ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" will result in adding that color two more times. If it's any new word, it would presumably follow the same rule once we define the color that the new word represents.",1.0,119,walm
"walm -> red

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red."" As we only have two words and three reds in the output, ""walm"" could imply repetition.
2. ""lug walm wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue red."" Here ""lug"" is before ""walm"" and results in ""blue"" being repeated before the ""red"" associated with ""wif"".
3. ""zup wif walm"" outputs ""yellow red red red."" We know ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and ""zup"" apparently leads to ""yellow."" The presence of ""walm"" again results in repetition of the color tied to the word immediately preceding ""walm.""
4. ""lug wif dax walm zup"" outputs ""blue red green green green yellow."" ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in the repetition of ""green"" this time, indicating once again that ""walm"" causes the color of the word right before it to repeat.
5. ""zup wif walm"" mirrors the third example, further solidifying the pattern.

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to function as an instruction that means ""repeat the color associated with the previous word.""

"From examining the provided examples, it seems like the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output.

However, to create a general rule, we should consider the position of ""wif"" in the input as well as the number of times ""red"" appears in the output. In each example, ""wif"" results in a single ""red"" in the output, which suggests that the meaning of ""wif"" is not contingent on its position in the sequence or the surrounding words. Therefore, no matter where ""wif"" appears in the input or what other words are present, it translates to ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> ""red""",1.0,120,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif"" in this context, let's look at the relationship between the input strings and their corresponding output colors. Observing the patterns:

1) When ""wif"" is present in the input, the immediate next word or element in the input sequence corresponds to ""red"" in the output, regardless of what that element is. All the other words have their consistent color mappings: ""dax"" is always followed by ""green,"" ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to repeating ""red.""

2) The word ""wif"" does not have a direct color mapping but seems to affect the following word such that it becomes ""red"" in the output.

Based on these observations, we deduce the rule as follows:

Rule: The presence of ""wif"" in the input causes the next word to be translated as ""red"" in the output.",1.0,120,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's first look at the corresponding outputs for each case where ""wif"" appears.

1. ""wif"" precedes ""lug"" (blue): Output is ""red blue"".
2. ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"" (green) ""zup"" (yellow) ""walm"" (red red red): Output is ""red green yellow yellow yellow"".
3. ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" (unknown) ""lug"" (blue): Output is ""red red blue"".
4. ""dax"" (green) ""zup"" (yellow) ""lug"" (blue) followed by ""wif lug"" (blue): Output is ""green yellow blue red blue"".

Reviewing the patterns, ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"" in the output. When following ""wif"" with a word that has a known color associated with it, the color corresponding to that word does not seem to be altered. Additionally, when a word precedes ""wif,"" its corresponding color output also does not change. 

Therefore, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of context.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,120,wif
"Analyzing the provided examples, we notice a pattern in what follows the word ""wif"" and the color that is being output:

1. `dax wif walm` -> `green red red red`
2. `wif lug` -> `red blue`
3. `wif dax zup walm` -> `red green yellow yellow yellow`
4. `dax zup wif bluf lug` -> `green yellow red red blue`
5. `dax zup lug wif lug` -> `green yellow blue red blue`

From the examples, we can notice that every time ""wif"" precedes another word, the output for ""wif"" itself is always ""red"". However, the color for the word that follows varies. Additionally, for each word after ""wif"" that is not ""lug"", the output is a repetition of the same color multiple times (based on the following word's output). Here are some specific observations:

- Whenever ""wif"" comes before ""lug"", ""lug"" is always blue.
- ""walm"" after ""wif"" translates to three reds, while ""walm"" without ""wif"" in front was not given, so we can't confirm its color alone.
- ""dax"" after ""wif"" translates to a single green.
- ""zup"" after ""wif"" leads to three yellows.
- ""bluf"" after ""wif"" gives two reds followed by blue, similar to what we see with ""wif lug.""

We can establish that ""wif"" preceding any word changes the output pattern of the subsequent word. More specifically, it seems to repeat the color associated with the subsequent word a certain number of times.

Rule: ""wif"" -> Indicates the word that follows should be repeated based on its associated color. The exact number of times the color is repeated seems to be deducible only if the standard color output for that word is known; thus, without additional examples or rules for the words alone, it is difficult to deduce the exact repetition rule for ""wif"". However, it is evident that ""wif"" is a modifier that affects the output color pattern of the following word.",0.8,120,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to examine the pattern of colors in the output associated with each nonce word's occurrence.

Examining the outputs:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow 
- walm -> red (repeated for emphasis)

Now, let’s see how the outputs relate to the presence of ""wif"":

1. dax wif walm -> green red red red
   Clearly, ""wif"" is followed by a color sequence starting with ""red."" Since ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and is then translated to multiple ""red,"" it suggests that ""wif"" might cause the repetition or emphasis of the next word.

2. wif lug -> red blue
   Since ""lug"" is associated with blue, and we get ""red blue,"" it matches with the previous observation that ""wif"" may precede the color red before the actual color associated with the following word.

3. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow
   ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""walm"" follow ""wif"" and are associated with ""green,"" ""yellow,"" and ""red"" respectively. However, the word ""walm"" translates to multiple ""yellow"" instead of ""red"" here. This contradicts the previous assumption a bit but suggests ""wif"" may also introduce repetition of the color associated with the word following the first one after ""wif.""

4. dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue
   The presence of an unrecognized word ""bluf"" before ""lug"" introduces a ""red"" associated with ""wif"" and an additional ""red."" The ""lug"" remains consistent with ""blue.""

5. dax zup lug wif lug -> green yellow blue red blue
   The second ""lug"" after ""wif"" doesn't introduce repetition which is inconsistent with the previous pattern observed in (3). However, the introduction of ""red"" before the color of the word following ""wif"" is still consistent.

From these observations, we can create a tentative rule for ""wif"":

Rule: ""wif"" precedes the color red before outputting the associated color of the word that follows it. If the word after ""wif"" is not immediately followed by another word, it does not cause repetition in color. If there are words following the word immediately after ""wif,"" it could sometimes introduce repetition. But as the pattern is not entirely consistent for this latter part, we cannot conclusively state the rule for those cases.

So, in conclusion, the following rule can be deduced:

Rule: wif -> introduces the color ""red"" in the output before the color associated with the following word.",0.7,120,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The term ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in this context. Each unique input word is associated with a specific color. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" When multiple words are used in combination, their corresponding colors are output in the order the words appear. ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the presence of other words.",1.0,120,zup
"From the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" translates to the color yellow. Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. The presence or absence of ""zup"" in an input string reliably results in the presence or absence of ""yellow"" in the output string. No other factor in the inputs seems to affect this output when ""zup"" is present.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,120,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

"From the given examples, the word ""zup"" seems to consistently correspond to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output. Therefore, based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be:

Rule:

Rule: bluf -> red,1.0,120,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, each instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> red

Rule: When you encounter the word ""bluf,"" you should translate it to ""red.""",1.0,120,bluf
"Analyzing the input and output pairs, we can see a pattern that relates to the color name following the nonce word ""bluf."" Here's the pattern we notice:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" then ""lug,"" the output is red twice, then blue.
- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is red then blue.
- When ""bluf"" is alone with ""wif,"" the output is red twice.

Given these inputs and outputs, we can induce that the rule for ""bluf"" is related to the following word or the word that comes right before it, and it outputs a series of two colors. However, it seems that the presence of other words, like ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup,"" also affects the output color. The first color appears to match the color designated to the word immediately preceding ""bluf,"" and the second color corresponds to the word immediately following ""bluf."" If there is no word after ""bluf,"" the second color repeats the color of the preceding term.

From the data given:

- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be inferred as follows: When ""bluf"" is used in a sequence of words, it takes the color associated with the word just before it and the word just after it. If there is no word after, ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word.

- In the second example, ""wif"" translates to red, ""dax"" to green, and ""zup"" to yellow. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" we once again get a repetition of green: ""red red red green yellow.""

- In the fourth example, ""lug"" translates to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""wif"" to red. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" we get a repetition of blue: ""blue blue blue yellow red.""

"Based on the given examples, we can determine that the word ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color word that comes before it. Let's break it down:

1. dax walm -> green green green. The word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" After ""walm,"" the word ""green"" is repeated three times.

2. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow. ""Walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" Following ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.

4. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red. Again, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times afterward.

5. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow. ""Zup"" comes before ""walm"" and is associated with ""yellow."" Following ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times.

walm -> meaning: When ""walm"" follows a word, the output is the color associated with that preceding word repeated three times.",1.0,120,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to correspond with the output of three consecutive color words which are identical. The color word seems to match the word immediately preceding ""walm"" in the input. Hence, we have the following correlations:

- ""dax walm"" produced ""green green green."" Here, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green.""
- ""wif walm"" in the second example led to ""red red red."" In this case, ""wif"" comes before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug walm"" resulted in ""blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and matches to the color ""blue.""
- ""zup walm"" led to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" with ""zup"" coming before ""walm,"" correlating to ""yellow.""

With these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it requires the word immediately before it to be repeated in the output as three consecutive colors that are the same as the first color indicated by the preceding word.

Considering the third observation conflicts with the pattern established in the first two observations and comparing the given inputs and outputs, it seems that perhaps the color change to green in the fourth example may not be connected directly to the word ""walm"" but to the combination of the preceding words, as ""dax"" has been observed in other situations to correspond to green.

Hence, the rule appears to be: the word ""walm"" generates a sequence of reds equivalent to the quantity of words preceding it in the sequence before ""walm"" arrives, with an exception noted in observation 3 which may be unrelated to ""walm"" itself.

Rule: walm -> generates a sequence of red outputs, with the number of reds corresponding to the number of words preceding ""walm"".",0.6,121,walm
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,122,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""",1.0,122,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,122,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it can be deduced that the word ""lug"" is consistently translated as ""blue"".

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,122,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" across all examples provided.",1.0,122,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we must compare the inputs and outputs to see if there is a pattern involving the word ""dax"" that correlates with a consistent color. Each mention of the word ""dax"" in the input results in the color ""green"" in the output. The rest of the words in the inputs appear to correspond to different colors, and ""dax"" appears each time ""green"" is stated in the output. Here are the associations for the other words as well:

- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
- ""bluf"" correlates with ""green"" (but we should note that in the example ""wif dax bluf,"" ""dax"" and ""bluf"" both lead to ""green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" might sometimes also mean ""green"" or that there is an overriding rule when ""dax"" appears)
- ""walm"" has limited appearances but appears to correlate with ""green"" as well

The overriding pattern is that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. So, we can conclude:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the given outputs.",1.0,122,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided that consistently correlate with the word ""dax"" and the corresponding output. By examining each example:

1. dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green
2. wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> red red yellow red blue green
3. zup dax lug -> yellow green blue
4. wif dax bluf -> red green green
5. dax walm wif lug dax walm -> green green green red blue green green green

The following observations can be made:
- Every time ""dax"" appears, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
- ""dax"" does not depend on its position in the sequence, meaning it is not context-sensitive within these provided examples.

Given these observations, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be consistent and context-independent:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,122,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green."" In every instance, regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input string, the output color corresponding to ""dax"" is ""green."" There seems to be no contextual dependency that alters the meaning of ""dax""; it is consistently mapped to ""green"" across all examples.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,122,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax."" In each instance, we can observe what output color corresponds with the word ""dax."" 

1. In the first example, ""dax"" appears at the beginning and the end, and both ""dax"" correspond to the color green.

2. In the second example, ""dax"" appears at the end and corresponds to the color green.

3. In the third example, ""dax"" is in the middle and corresponds to the color green.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" again corresponds to the color green.

5. In the fifth example, ""dax"" appears multiple times and always corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position.

From these examples, we can deduce the following:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green regardless of its position or the surrounding words.",1.0,122,dax
"Rule: 

Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. No context beyond the position of ""dax"" in the sequence seems to affect this translation.

dax -> green",1.0,122,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can infer that the word ""wif"" acts as a transformation word for the word that comes directly after it. Each input word like ""dax,"" ""lug,"" or ""bluf"" has a corresponding color output (""green,"" ""blue,"" ""red,"" etc.), and when ""wif"" precedes one of those words, it changes the associated color.

Let's take a closer look at the patterns:

- ""dax"" by itself results in ""green"".
- ""wif"" before ""dax"" results in ""red green"".

- ""lug"" by itself is not shown, but ""wif"" before ""lug"" results in ""red blue"".

- ""bluf"" by itself is not shown either, but ""wif"" before ""bluf"" results in ""red red"".

From the above points, it's clear that when ""wif"" is before any word, ""red"" is added to the output before the color that word represents.

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be:

Rule: When used before a word, ""wif"" adds ""red"" to the output associated with the following word.",1.0,122,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red,"" as each time ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. We can confirm this by the consistent appearance of ""red"" after any other color mentioned, which always follows ""wif.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,122,wif
"Rule: wif -> ""red"" 

The word ""wif"" consistently leads to the output ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,122,wif
"Analyzing the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""wif"".

Example 1: 
Input: dax wif
Output: green red

Example 2:
Input: lug wif dax wif
Output: blue red green red

Example 3:
Input: dax lug wif bluf
Output: green blue red red

Example 4:
Input: wif lug zup bluf
Output: red blue yellow yellow

Example 5:
Input: wif dax
Output: red green

From the above examples, it seems that ""wif"" translates into the color ""red"", irrespective of its position in the sequence. This can be seen because, whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" is in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule:
wif -> red",1.0,122,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided:

1. ""dax wif"" gives ""green red""
2. ""lug wif dax wif"" gives ""blue red green red""
3. ""dax lug wif bluf"" gives ""green blue red red""
4. ""wif lug zup bluf"" gives ""red blue yellow yellow""
5. ""wif dax"" gives ""red green""

Comparing the inputs and outputs systematically:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""wif,"" the output for ""dax"" is ""green"" and the following ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug wif"" always results in ""blue red.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" the output is ""red blue,"" suggesting that ""wif"" doesn't just translate to ""red"" in isolation; its meaning changes in the presence of other words.
- When ""wif"" is at the beginning of the sentence, it translates to ""red.""
- However, ""wif"" also appears at the end of an input (""lug wif"", ""dax wif""), and in all cases, it translates to ""red.""

From these observations, we can derive that ""wif"" means ""red,"" but its meaning does not change based on its position or the word that precedes or follows it. 

Rule: wif -> red",0.9,122,wif
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of zup yields ""yellow"" in the output. Thus, it seems that zup always corresponds to the word ""yellow"" regardless of the context in which it appears. Therefore, the rule can be written as:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,122,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the output always includes the color ""yellow"".",1.0,122,zup
"Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" consistently in every output sequence. 

Each other word ahead of ""zup"" seems to translate to a different color:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> unclear, but it might also be blue since it results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red"" for the input ""zup walm lug wif,"" aligning with the colors ""lug"" and ""wif"" output.

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" appears to be:

zup -> yellow",1.0,122,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples provided, whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the output always includes the word ""yellow."" Therefore, ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs.",1.0,122,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in every example provided.",1.0,122,zup
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the previous word. Here is the pattern deduced from the examples:

- When ""dax"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is green followed by blue (""dax lug bluf dax"" -> ""green blue blue green"").
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is two yellows (""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"").
- When ""wif"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is two reds (""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"").
- A sequence containing ""dax zup bluf"" results in green, yellow, and two yellows, indicating that ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup"" (""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow"").
- Similarly, a sequence with ""lug wif bluf"" gives blue, red, and two reds, with ""bluf"" repeating the red from ""wif"" (""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red"").

We can then deduce that ""bluf"" replicates the color of the word that comes immediately before it. If no color is provided prior to ""bluf,"" we do not have an example, and thus we cannot deduce what the output would be in such a case.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the preceding word.",1.0,122,bluf
Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word.,1.0,122,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" appears to reflect the repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. 

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a word, the output is the color corresponding to that preceding word, repeated twice. For example, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, so ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green."" Similarly, ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, so ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red."" If ""bluf"" is preceded by two different color words, only the color of the word immediately before ""bluf"" is repeated.",1.0,122,bluf
"Rule: Bluf copies the color associated with the previously mentioned word.

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red

So, bluf means repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it.
",1.0,122,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,122,bluf
"To figure out the rule, let's look at the instances when ""walm"" appears and the corresponding output:

1. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
2. ""zup lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
3. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
4. ""dax walm wif bluf"" -> ""green green green red red""
5. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""

In each output set, ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color word equivalent to the nonce word that appears immediately before ""walm."" Here is the breakdown:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" is not directly followed by ""walm,"" but it corresponds to ""red""

Every time ""walm"" appears, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated one additional time. For example, ""dax lug walm"" resulted in ""green blue blue blue"" (with ""blue"" being repeated due to ""lug"").

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word one more time.",1.0,122,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's first look for patterns in the examples:

1. Output colors correspond to words in the input.
2. The same input word can correspond to different colors in the output depending on the context.
3. ""wif"" and ""dax"" both lead to the output color red and green respectively, regardless of their position.
4. ""lug"" leads to the color blue following its occurrence.
5. ""zup"" alone leads to yellow (second example), and ""zup walm"" leads to double yellow (first and second examples).
6. The output immediately after ""walm"" is always the same color as the output immediately before it.
7. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is three greens (third example), and when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is two yellows (first and second examples). This suggests that ""walm"" extends the color that precedes it.

Given that ""walm"" directly follows a color word and causes repetition of the color in the output, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the preceding color in the output.",0.9,122,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the color outputs relative to the presence of ""walm"" and other words in the input sequences, focusing on any patterns that emerge with ""walm.""

1. Whenever ""walm"" appears, a series of the same color follows. 
2. The number of times that color repeats seems to be one more than the position of ""walm"" in the sequence (e.g., if ""walm"" is the third word, the color repeats four times).
3. The color that repeats corresponds to the color that is coded for the word that precedes ""walm"":
   - When preceded by ""wif,"" the pattern is red.
   - When preceded by ""dax,"" the pattern is green.
   - There is no direct example of ""lug"" or ""bluf"" directly before ""walm"" to determine their specific color effect.

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rule:

walm -> meaning: The word ""walm"" causes the next several words (or until the sequence ends) to repeat the color code of the word that immediately precedes ""walm."" The number of repetitions is equal to ""walm's"" position in the word sequence plus one. 

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in an input sequence, output the color corresponding to the preceding word as many times as the position of ""walm"" plus one.",0.9,122,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's consider each instance where it appears and the corresponding output:

1. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

4. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

Looking at the inputs and outputs, here's what we can discern about the other words before considering ""walm"":

- ""wif"" seems to correlate with ""red.""
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green.""
- ""bluf"" has appeared twice and correlates with ""red,"" though we have an instance of ""wif,"" which also correlates with ""red.""

Now, let's consider ""walm."" Whenever ""walm"" appears, it causes repetition in the output color. The rule seems to be:

- ""walm"" causes the color of the word just before it to repeat. Examples:
  - In the first example, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" repeating the ""yellow"" that ""zup"" indicates.
  - In the third example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" repeating the ""blue"" that ""lug"" indicates.
  - In the fourth example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" repeating the ""green"" signaled by ""dax.""

Notably, ""walm"" after ""dax"" repeats the color three times, while after other words, it repeats the color two or more times depending on how many times the word ""zup"" appears before it.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word at least twice, with potential additional repetitions influenced by adjacent words.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color indicated by the previous word multiple times.",0.9,122,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the examples given and identify a pattern that can tie ""walm"" to the output colors. Here's the analysis:

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

From these examples, we can observe the following patterns associated with the word ""walm"":

1. The phrase ""wif walm"" produces two reds followed by a red for ""walm.""
2. The phrase ""zup walm"" produces two yellows followed by a yellow for ""walm.""
3. The phrase ""dax walm"" produces three greens followed by a green for ""walm.""
4. The phrase ""lug walm"" always results in two blues followed by additional blues for ""walm.""
5. Regardless of the preceding word, when ""walm"" is present, the immediately following word after ""walm"" has the same colors repeated: red for ""wif,"" yellow for ""zup,"" green for ""dax,"" blue for ""lug.""

The pattern suggests that ""walm"" could mean ""repeat the next word's color sequence, preceded by the sequence determined by the preceding word."" However, if ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence (as in the first input), it seems to just repeat its designated color sequence based on the preceding word.

It is also important to note that ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" each have their color associations—red, yellow, green, and blue, respectively. 

Rule: walm -> ""repeat""

Meaning: ""walm"" causes the next word's color sequence to repeat, and it also repeats its color cycle based on the preceding word's associated color. If ""walm"" is the last word, it just repeats its color sequence based on the word that precedes it.",0.8,122,walm

- In the second example, ""zup"" appears once, and there's one ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in a two-word and a two-word sequence, respectively.

- ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red""
- ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue""

- In the fourth example, it's clear that ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in green once again.

Following the established rule, ""dax walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times, while ""zup"" and ""lug"" are not affected by ""walm"" as they follow it, thus are mentioned only once.
4. The repetition of ""zup walm"" with the same output as the previous instance, ""yellow yellow yellow,"" serves to confirm the pattern.
5. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue green blue blue blue."" ""Dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" to blue, and ""walm"" applied to ""lug"" multiplies the occurrence of ""blue"" by three.

Based on the above analysis, the meaning of ""walm"" is that it causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times.",1.0,123,walm
"After studying the provided examples, it seems that the echo word ""walm"" translates to repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times in the output. 

Let's analyze each provided example to understand how the operation works:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Here, ""lug"" corresponds to 'blue'. ""Walm"" causes 'blue' to be repeated thrice.

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   In this case, ""zup"" corresponds to 'yellow'. ""Walm"" causes 'yellow' to be repeated thrice.

3. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to 'green', which is followed by ""walm"", causing 'green' to be repeated three times. After that, ""zup"" corresponds to 'yellow' and ""lug"" to 'blue'.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Similarly, ""zup"" corresponds to 'yellow', and ""walm"" repeats it three times.

5. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   In this sequence, ""dax"" corresponds to 'green' and ""lug"" corresponds to 'blue'. The final ""walm"" follows a ""lug"", which causes 'blue' to be repeated three times.

Based on the given data, the rule for ""walm"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word thrice.",1.0,123,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" means to repeat the color word associated with the word prior to ""walm,"" three times if the word before ""walm"" is alone, or adding an additional repeat for each time the color word is mentioned consecutively before ""walm.""

For instance:
- ""lug walm"" has ""lug"" (blue) before ""walm,"" so it's ""blue"" repeated three times.
- ""zup walm"" has ""zup"" (yellow) before ""walm,"" so it's ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- ""dax walm zup lug"" is more complex because ""dax"" (green) is before ""walm,"" but the pattern after ""walm"" must consider ""zup"" (yellow) and ""lug"" (blue) separately, which don't repeat as ""walm"" isn't immediately following them.
- ""dax lug dax lug walm"" shows that ""lug"" (blue) is before ""walm"". Given that ""lug"" appears twice in a row before ""walm,"" the pattern suggests adding a repeat, leading to ""blue"" repeated four times (three times for the ""walm"" rule plus one for the extra ""lug"" before ""walm""). 

Therefore:
walm -> meaning. Repeat the color word prior to ""walm"" three times if alone, or add an additional repeat for each consecutive mention of the color word before ""walm.""",1.0,123,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can try to induce the rule for the word ""walm.""

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue

Observing the outputs, ""walm"" seems to be a function or command that repeats the color corresponding to the last word that came before it. Specifically, each instance of ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color denoted by the word immediately preceding it three times if it is ""lug"" or ""zup"", and four times if it is ""dax lug"".

Here are the correlations:
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" (lug walm), the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" (zup walm), the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- When ""dax"" and ""lug"" precede ""walm"" (dax lug walm), the output is the colors corresponding to ""dax"" and ""lug"" (green and blue, respectively), followed by ""blue"" repeated four times.

Therefore:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""lug"" or ""zup"", it repeats the color three times. If it is preceded by the words ""dax lug"", then ""blue"" is repeated four times.",0.9,123,walm
"To deduce the rule that determines the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for consistent patterns relating to the use of this nonce word in the examples provided.

Here are the observations:

- When ""lug walm"" is given as input, the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- When ""zup walm"" is given, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- For ""dax walm zup lug,"" the output is ""green green green yellow blue."" 
  - Notably, ""green"" corresponds to ""dax,"" ""yellow"" to ""zup,"" and ""blue"" to ""lug."" The ""walm"" here is followed by ""green,"" which is the color associated with the word that appears just before it (""dax"").
- Again, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" consistent with the second example.
- In ""dax lug dax lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue green blue blue blue."" 
  - The pattern for ""dax"" and ""lug"" remains consistent, and ""walm"" here repeats the output for ""lug"" three times, as opposed to twice like in the other examples, possibly because ""lug"" appears twice before ""walm.""

Considering these observations, it appears that ""walm"" is a modifier that repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it a certain number of times. Here's an attempt at a rule, based on the examples given:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color output of the immediate preceding word. If the preceding word appears once, it repeats that color three times. If the preceding word appears twice in succession before ""walm,"" it repeats the color four times. 

However, we have only limited examples, especially for the case with twice repeated ""lug"" where the pattern of repetition changed, and we'd need more data to confirm the nature and exceptions of the rule. But with the current information, we can define:

walm -> meaning: Repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times; if the preceding word is repeated, the color repetition increases by one (to four), possibly adding one repetition for each additional consecutive occurrence of the same word before ""walm.""",0.8,123,walm

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. 

Hence, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,124,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output includes the color green in the corresponding position. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green in the given examples.",1.0,124,dax

"Based on the provided examples, the word 'dax' is consistently translated to the color 'green.' The word 'dax' does not appear to change meaning based on its position in the sentence or the context it's used in. Other words in the input correspond to different colors ('zup' to yellow, 'lug' to blue, 'bluf' also to green, 'walm' to blue, and 'wif' to red).

Thus, the rule for the meaning of 'dax' within these examples is:

The examples show that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow."" It doesn't seem to change meaning based on position or the presence of other words. Every time ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,124,zup
"From the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule by analyzing the patterns and correspondences between the inputs and outputs.

Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow
- Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: lug wif zup wif walm -> Output: blue red yellow red red red
- ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The repeated ""wif walm"" after ""zup"" seems to translate into repeated ""red red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" may correspond to ""red"" (assuming that color repetition is meaningful).

Input: zup walm dax -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" to ""red,"" but the output is three ""yellow"" followed by a ""green"" which corresponds to ""dax."" However, there's no ""red"" despite the presence of ""walm."" This suggests that the previous assumption about ""walm"" might not be accurate. Alternatively, ""walm"" could be a repetition modifier for the preceding term.

Input: dax zup lug -> Output: green yellow blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" This supports the direct correspondence for ""zup"" to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"" but doesn't provide additional information for ""walm.""

Input: zup wif walm lug -> Output: yellow red red red blue
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The pattern of ""walm"" again follows ""wif"" and seems to result in a repetition of ""red,"" which reinforces the idea of ""walm"" possibly being a repetition modifier when combined with ""wif.""

Based on these observations, we can induce that:

Rule: ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule we can induce is:

zup -> yellow.",1.0,124,zup
"From the examples given, we can infer that each word corresponds to a specific color. Let's look at the consistency between the inputs and outputs to determine the pattern for the word ""zup"".

- In every example where ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. 
- There are no instances where ""zup"" appears and ""yellow"" does not appear in the output.
- On the contrary, wherever ""yellow"" appears in the output, ""zup"" is present in the input.
- The position of ""yellow"" in the output corresponds to the position of ""zup"" in the input.

Given these observations, we can conclude the rule for ""zup"" is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,124,zup
"Given the examples, we can see that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" is consistent and does not seem to depend on the context or surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,124,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color 'red' when it follows ""zup"" or ""wif"", and it corresponds to the color 'green' when it follows ""lug"" or ""dax"". The word that comes before ""bluf"" determines its meaning:

- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow red""
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red""
- ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue green""
- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green""

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes the color that the previous word represents when that color follows a certain pattern in the sequence. This pattern seems to be:

- If preceded by ""zup"" or ""wif"" (which output ""yellow"" and ""red"", respectively), ""bluf"" means ""red.""
- If preceded by ""lug"" or ""dax"" (which output ""blue"" and ""green"", respectively), ""bluf"" means ""green.""

"walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a series of the color associated with the preceding word repeated three times.

Rule: ""walm"" appears to be a modifier that repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times. If there is no word before ""walm"" that can be clearly associated with a color, it does not produce an output.

Examples to rules application:

1. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue"": Here, ""lug"" is associated with blue, therefore ""walm"" causes the output to repeat blue three times after the initial blue.

2. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue"": ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with blue, resulting in three blue outputs.

3. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"": ""zup"" is associated with yellow and it's directly before ""walm"", causing a triple yellow output.

4. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" -> ""blue red yellow red red red"": Here, ""wif"" is the word right before ""walm"" and is associated with red, so ""walm"" results in red being outputted three times after ""red.""

5. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red"": After the initial ""zup walm"" sequence which results in three yellows, the pattern continues with the next color associations without ""walm"" until the end where ""wif"" is associated with red but does not have a ""walm"" following it, thus it's a single red output.",1.0,124,walm
"Analyzing the input and output patterns, it appears that the presence of the word ""walm"" generates a repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word multiple times, depending on some condition. 

For instance:
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" took the color associated with ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" and repeated it three additional times.
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where the color ""yellow"" associated with ""zup"" is repeated two additional times due to ""walm.""
- In the example with ""lug wif zup wif walm,"" ""walm"" seems to not only repeat the last color, ""red,"" which is associated with ""wif,"" but it also triggers a total of three repetitions.

Additionally, ""walm"" does not introduce a new color but rather amplifies the last mentioned color. However, when it follows a sequence of different words/colors (""lug wif zup wif walm""), only the last color before ""walm"" gets repeated, regardless of the previous sequence.

Based on these observations, the general rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the last mentioned word a number of times equal to the total number of colors mentioned before it since the last occurrence of ""walm"" (or since the start if ""walm"" hasn't occurred before). 

Therefore, the rule can be defined as:
Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the directly preceding word multiple times, where the number of repetitions is equal to the number of color mentions preceding it, counting each color mention since the last ""walm"" or the beginning of the series if ""walm"" hasn't occurred yet.

Applying this rule, here's how the outputs are produced:
- ""wif lug walm"": ""walm"" is after ""lug,"" hence ""blue"" is repeated four times (since there are two color mentions before it: ""wif"" -> red, ""lug"" -> blue).
- ""dax lug walm"": ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" so ""blue"" is repeated four times (two color mentions: ""dax"" -> green, ""lug"" -> blue).
- ""zup walm"": ""walm"" is after ""zup,"" so ""yellow"" is repeated three times (one color mention: ""zup"" -> yellow).
- ""lug wif zup wif walm"": ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" leading to ""red"" being repeated four times (three color mentions before ""walm"": ""lug"" -> blue, ""wif"" -> red, ""zup"" -> yellow; ""wif"" is counted once as only the last color is considered).
- ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"": ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" so ""yellow"" is repeated three times; when ""walm"" is not present, colors follow as normal for their associated word.

walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the most recent color mentioned, with the number of repetitions being equal to the number of distinct color mentions since the last occurrence of ""walm"" or the start if ""walm"" has not appeared before.",0.9,124,walm
"walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:

Based on the given examples, we must deduce what ""walm"" means according to the colors presented in the outputs. Let's analyze:

1. ""wif lug walm"" results in ""red blue blue blue"". 
2. ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue"".
3. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"".
4. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" results in ""blue red yellow red red red"".
5. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red"".

From the output, the pattern for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the previous word multiple times. Specifically, it repeats the color three times, except when following the word ""lug"", in which case it repeats the color of ""lug"" four times. Therefore, the term ""walm"" may be a command to replicate the color output of the word immediately preceding it. 

Let's check this against each example:

1. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue"" - ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" from ""lug"", three times, plus one extra repetition for following ""lug"".
2. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue"" - Similar to the previous example, ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" from ""lug"" four times.
3. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" - ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" from ""zup"" three times.
4. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" -> ""blue red yellow red red red"" - ""walm"" repeats ""red"" from ""wif"" three times.
5. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red"" - ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" from ""zup"" three times.

So, the rule for ""walm"" is: repeat the color of the previous word three times or four times if the previous word is ""lug"".

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times, four if the previous word is ""lug"".",0.9,124,walm
"Reviewing the examples given, we can attempt to determine what the nonce word ""walm"" represents by identifying patterns and applying rule induction.

1. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
2. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
3. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
4. lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red
5. zup walm dax zup dax wif -> yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

In the first and second examples, ""walm"" is preceded by different words (""wif"" and ""dax"" respectively), but the output is three repetitions of blue plus the associated color of the word preceding ""lug"" (""wif"" -> red, ""dax"" -> green). In both cases, ""lug"" is followed by three blues, suggesting ""lug"" might always be followed by blue.

In the third example, ""zup walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow,"" implying that ""walm"" might represent a repetition of the color that comes before it, in this case, yellow.

In the fourth example, we again see that the color that comes before ""walm"" (red, from ""wif"") is repeated three times after ""walm.""

The fifth example further corroborates the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color before it three times. After ""walm,"" we see a repetition of yellow, which corresponds to ""zup"" before ""walm,"" and after ""dax,"" which is green followed by ""zup"" (yellow) and ""wif"" (red), we do not see repetition, as ""walm"" is not following them.

Rule: From the given examples, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it three times.

Therefore:
walm -> meaning. Meaning: ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times.",0.9,124,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we have to look for patterns and consistent correlations in the given examples. Let's examine the examples and their outputs:

4. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red
   
5. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

Observations:
- In each example where ""walm"" appears, it is followed by a repetition of colored words (either blue, red, or yellow) in the output.
- The number of repetitions depends on the preceding words.
  - ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" results in ""blue"" repeated three times.
  - ""wif"" before ""walm"" with no ""lug"" in the example results in ""red"" repeated multiple times, depending on the position of ""wif"" and the number of times ""zup"" appears.
  - ""zup"" before ""walm"" with no ""lug"" results in ""yellow"" repeated as many times as ""zup"" appears before ""walm"".
- From the fourth example, it appears that when multiple colors are in play, each color's repetition immediately follows the word that triggers it.

   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

4. ""zup bluf wif"" -> ""yellow yellow red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in this case, which differs from previous examples
   - ""wif"" remains consistent with ""red""

5. ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

The examples consistently show that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" However, one inconsistency is observed in example 4 where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" instead of the ""red"" observed in the previous cases. This inconsistency may be due to an error in the example or may suggest a more complex rule that is not immediately apparent from the given examples.

Considering the information we have, and ignoring the inconsistency with ""bluf"" in example 4, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red",0.9,125,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".",1.0,125,zup
zup -> yellow.,1.0,125,zup
"Based on the examples provided, zup translates to the color yellow each time it appears. Here's the mapping:

Input: wif zup bluf lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to an extra ""yellow"" (which may be an error or a specific rule that has not been established due to a lack of data)
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to an extra ""yellow""
- The repeat of ""zup lug"" yields ""yellow blue"" again

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
Output: red green red red yellow red
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to an extra ""red"" (again, possibly an error or a specific contextual rule not yet established)
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Given the consistent correlation between ""zup"" and ""yellow,"" we can establish the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,125,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word zup:

zup -> meaning: yellow

Rule: Whenever the word zup is encountered in the input, it is translated to the word yellow in the output.",1.0,125,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in each example provided.",1.0,125,zup
"Bluf -> yellow. Rule: Every instance of ""bluf"" in the input is translated to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,125,bluf
"bluf -> yellow

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color yellow consistently in every given example. The position of ""bluf"" in the input does not alter its output, indicating that the meaning of ""bluf"" is independent of context within the scope of the provided examples.",1.0,125,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow."" Each time ""bluf"" is mentioned in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output. There does not seem to be any contextual dependence altering the meaning of ""bluf"" as it consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the presence of other nonce words in the input.

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: bluf -> yellow",1.0,125,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sentence. Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the output consistently includes ""yellow"". Here's the rule associated with ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf -> yellow",1.0,125,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red"" when following the word ""wif"" and to the color ""yellow"" when following the word ""zup"" or when ""bluf"" stands alone.

bluf -> ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup"" or standing alone.
bluf -> ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"".",1.0,125,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the term ""walm"" appears to be a rule that applies a specific color output to the word that precedes it. Here's how we can analyze it:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green,"" which implies that ""walm"" might be a rule that repeats the color associated with the word before it (""dax"" in this case) three times.

- The second example, ""wif lug dax walm,"" outputs ""red blue green green green,"" which supports the idea that 'walm' repeats the color of the preceding word (in this case ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"") three times.

- The third example, ""lug wif dax zup walm,"" outputs ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow,"" which further supports the rule, as ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

- The fourth example, ""dax lug walm zup wif,"" outputs ""green blue blue blue yellow red,"" which fits the rule as well, with ""lug"" preceding ""walm"" and its associated color ""blue"" being repeated three times.

- In the fifth example, ""dax walm zup,"" outputs ""green green green yellow."" It aligns with the rule as ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the color ""green"" associated with ""dax"" is repeated three times. The color ""yellow"" is for ""zup,"" which appears after ""walm"" and is not influenced by the ""walm"" rule.

By analyzing these patterns, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.",1.0,125,walm
"To find the meaning of ""walm,"" let's observe each instance:

1. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" which suggests that ""walm"" duplicates the color mentioned before it twice more.
2. ""wif lug dax walm"" becomes ""red blue green green green,"" which confirms that ""walm"" again duplicates the preceding color two more times.
3. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" turns into ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating ""walm"" triples the last color.
4. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" leads to ""green blue blue blue yellow red,"" where ""walm"" triples the last color before it and is followed by other colors after it, not affecting the duplication.
5. ""dax walm zup"" results in ""green green green yellow,"" where ""walm"" repeats the last color twice even when followed by another color.

Rule: ""walm"" -> When preceding a color, it duplicates that color twice more.",1.0,125,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that precedes it, a total of three times. Here's the pattern observed with each usage of ""walm"":

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""green"" three times.
- When ""dax"" and other words precede ""walm"", ""green"" is still repeated three times, demonstrating the color associated with ""dax"" preceding the ""walm"".
- The context indicates that ""walm"" is dependent on the most recent word before it and does not account for the words that came before that, as shown by the ""lug wif dax"" example - only ""green"" is repeated thrice.
- Other words maintain their color associations, as seen with ""zup"" following ""walm"", resulting in ""yellow"" after the three repetitions of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"".

Hence, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it, three times.",1.0,125,walm
"Observing the examples and the relation between the inputs and outputs, we see that each instance of ""walm"" in the input corresponds to a repetition of the color output of the immediately preceding word. Here's the breakdown:

1. In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" outputs ""green,"" and then ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times.
2. In ""wif lug dax walm,"" ""wif"" outputs ""red,"" ""lug"" outputs ""blue,"" and ""dax"" outputs ""green."" The ""walm"" that follows this sequence repeats the ""green"" three times.
3. In ""lug wif dax zup walm,"" we see ""blue red green yellow"" and then ""walm"" repeats the ""yellow"" three times, which was the output for ""zup.""
4. In ""dax lug walm zup wif,"" ""dax"" outputs ""green,"" ""lug"" outputs ""blue,"" ""walm"" then repeats ""blue"" three times (following ""lug""), ""zup"" outputs ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" outputs ""red.""
5. In ""dax walm zup,"" ""dax"" outputs ""green,"" ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times, and ""zup"" outputs ""yellow.""

Based on the pattern observed, ""walm"" causes the color of the word it follows to be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,125,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the given examples.

1. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""
2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" regardless of other words before ""dax,"" the output is a series of ""green"" corresponding to the position of ""walm"" in the sequence.

This suggests that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm"" in the input sequence.

To confirm this, let's check all examples:
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" which fits the rule since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In the third example, ""dax zup walm"" results in ""green yellow yellow yellow,"" fitting the rule as ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" which is repeated three times for ""walm.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" before the sequence continues with ""zup wif,"" corresponding to the rule since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm"" again results in ""green green green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" matching the established rule.

Hence, the induced rule for the nonce word ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word in the sequence an equal number of times as the position of ""walm"" in the word sequence.",0.9,125,walm
"lug -> blue

"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""",1.0,126,lug
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" 

Every time ""dax"" is presented in the input, the word ""green"" is added to the output. This pattern is consistent across all examples. The word following ""dax"" does not appear to affect this translation as ""dax"" is followed by different words in the examples (e.g., ""wif,"" ""walm,"" ""zup""), but the output is consistently ""green"" regardless of the following word. 

""dax"" -> green

Rule: When the word ""dax"" is in the input, the color ""green"" is in the output at the corresponding position.",1.0,126,dax
"Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" seems to trigger the output of ""green."" To confirm this, we can look at every instance where ""dax"" is present in the input and check what is outputted at that same position. 

- In the first input, ""dax wif"" leads to ""green red,"" with ""dax"" preceding ""green.""
- In the second input, every ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output. The ""dax"" appears twice, and both times it is followed by ""green.""
- In the third input, ""zup dax zup wif"" leads to ""yellow green yellow red,"" with ""dax"" being followed by ""green"" once again.
- In the fourth input, ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" produces ""blue green yellow green green green red,"" where each occurrence of ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" in the output.
- In the fifth input, ""lug dax"" corresponds to ""blue green,"" where once again ""dax"" precedes ""green.""

In all cases, regardless of the words before or after ""dax,"" the presence of ""dax"" in the input consistently results in ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,126,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,126,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of positioning or the other words present in the input. In every example, whenever ""dax"" appears, the output consistently includes ""green.""

The evidence from the examples:

1. In the first input ""dax wif,"" ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" in the output.
2. In the second input, every occurrence of ""dax"" corresponds with ""green"" in the output.
3. For the third input, the word ""dax"" is still followed by ""green"" in the output sequence.
4. In the fourth input, both occurrences of ""dax"" correspond to ""green"" in the output.
5. Finally, in the fifth input, ""dax"" on its own translates to ""green"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green",1.0,126,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that each word corresponds to a color:

- wif -> red
- walm -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Now, we need to figure out what ""dax"" means. In every instance where ""dax"" appears in the Input, ""green"" appears in the Output, and it always precedes the color that corresponds to the next word in the input. For example:

- In Input ""dax wif"", ""dax"" precedes ""wif"", which outputs ""green red"".
- In Input ""lug dax"", ""dax"" follows ""lug"", which outputs ""blue green"", and there is no word after ""dax"".

From these patterns, we can induce that ""dax"" means ""green,"" but it's important to note that ""dax"" results in ""green"" being added before the color that corresponds to the following word in the input.

Rule: dax -> green before the color of the next word. If there is no word following ""dax"", it still means green.",1.0,126,dax
"wif -> red

"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in each example provided.",1.0,126,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Therefore, the rule can be described as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,126,wif

wif -> red. Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" irrespective of its position in the sequence.",1.0,126,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,126,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" can be defined as:

zup -> meaning: yellow

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, it is translated to ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,126,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,126,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow"". This can be derived from the consistent association between the input containing ""zup"" and the output containing the color ""yellow"". There is no indication from the examples that ""zup"" changes its meaning based on context, as it consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,126,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word zup corresponds to the color yellow in every given example.",1.0,126,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the context in which it is used. Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" is as follows:

Rule: Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.",0.0,126,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the correspondence of inputs and outputs:

1. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"" - It appears that both the word ""dax"" and ""walm"" correlate with the color green.
   
2. ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow"" - We can see that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and both occurrences of ""walm"" translate to ""red."" The word ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""

3. ""wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""red blue green green green"" - In this example, ""wif"" is to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""walm"" follows as ""green.""

4. ""lug walm wif lug"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue"" - Here, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" ""walm"" with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" with ""red.""

5. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"" - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm,"" when following ""zup,"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

From these examples, we see that ""walm"" does not have a consistent single color output. However, it has a consistent pattern: the color ""walm"" corresponds to always repeats the color that directly preceded it.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color word that comes immediately before it.",1.0,126,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in which the word appears and the corresponding output colors.

1. In the first example, ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"". Here, ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green,"" and because there's only one other word ""walm,"" we can guess that it might also mean ""green,"" as the output is only greens after that.

2. In the second example, ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" outputs ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow."" Here, we know that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" from the repetition of ""wif"" and the output. Again, ""walm"" is followed by repeated colors—three reds and, later, another set of three reds.

3. In the third example, ""wif lug dax walm"" outputs ""red blue green green green."" We have established that ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" and once ""walm"" is said, ""green"" is repeated multiple times.

4. The fourth example, ""lug walm wif lug,"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue."" Here, the first ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" followed by ""walm,"" after which ""blue"" is repeated twice, indicating ""walm"" might again correspond to ""blue."" However, when followed by ""wif,"" the output is ""red,"" which suggests that ""walm"" does not change the meaning of subsequent words but is associated with repetition of the last color mentioned.

5. In the last example, ""zup wif lug zup walm"" gives ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" followed later by ""walm,"" which precedes a repetition of ""yellow"" three times.

Looking at the pattern, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to repeat three times. This rule explains all the instances of the outputs provided.

Rule: walm -> causes the previous color to be repeated three more times.",1.0,126,walm
"Based on the data, ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of the color ""green"" repeated thrice. In every instance where ""walm"" appears in the input, the output consistently displays ""green green green.""

Rule: walm -> three instances of the word ""green"" in the output.",1.0,126,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" translates to multiple repetitions of the color ascribed to the word immediately preceding it. The rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the next output word to be repeated the number of times equivalent to the number of words between ""walm"" and the previous instance of ""walm"" or the start of the input if ""walm"" has not previously appeared.

Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"", and ""dax"" translates to ""green"". Since this is the first occurrence of ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated three times.
  
- In the second example, ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and is followed later by ""walm"", but because ""wif"" appears again before the second ""walm"" and there are two words between the first ""wif walm"" and the second ""wif walm"" sequence, ""red"" is repeated twice after each ""walm"".

- In the third example, ""dax"" comes before ""walm"" and results in ""green"" being repeated three times because there are two words (""lug dax"") before ""walm"".

- In the fourth example, ""lug"" comes before ""walm"" and translates to ""blue"". There are no words between ""lug"" and ""walm"", so ""blue"" is repeated three times before ""wif"" breaks the repetition with a ""red"".

- In the fifth example, ""zup"" comes before ""walm"" and translates to ""yellow"". Because there are three words (""wif lug zup"") between the occurrences of ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated three times after the word ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word a number of times equal to the count of words since the last ""walm"" or the start of the sequence if it is the first ""walm"".",0.9,126,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns before and after the usage of the word ""walm"":

1. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green.""
2. When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red.""
3. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output starts with ""blue blue blue.""
4. When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output starts with ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Notice how the color that follows each word is consistent regardless of the presence of ""walm"" (e.g., ""dax"" is always followed by the output ""green,"" ""wif"" by ""red,"" ""lug"" by ""blue,"" and ""zup"" by ""yellow""). It seems that the presence of ""walm"" causes the next color output to be tripled. 

Rule:
walm -> Causes the next color in the sequence to triple.",0.8,126,walm

"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,127,lug
"Based on the given examples, the word 'lug' appears to correspond to the sequence of the colors ""blue blue"".

Example 1: wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue blue green yellow yellow yellow
Considering the given output, after 'lug' we see ""blue green"", but ""green"" corresponds to 'dax' and 'wif' yields ""red"", 'zup' yields ""yellow"", and 'walm' appears to yield ""yellow"" as well. Therefore, it is most likely that 'lug' yields ""blue blue"" since it is directly followed by another color that can be accounted for by another word.

Example 2: zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red
Here 'lug' is followed by 'wif', which we know translates to ""red"". Before 'lug', we have ""green"" which is produced by 'walm', and ""green"" is associated with 'dax', so 'lug' should correspond to ""blue blue"" to fit the pattern of the output.

Example 3: lug bluf -> blue blue blue
Since 'bluf' produced ""blue"", and we have three ""blue"" in the output, it further strengthens the case that 'lug' itself is contributing ""blue blue"".

Example 4: zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue blue
Following the same deduction process, the presence of four ""blue"" after 'zup' implies that 'lug' is associated with ""blue blue"" and 'walm' with a single ""blue"".

Example 5: zup dax lug walm zup lug -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue blue
Here 'lug' appears twice and both times it yields two instances of ""blue"" following its associated words, again reinforcing the meaning of 'lug' as ""blue blue"".

Rule: lug -> blue blue",0.8,127,lug
"Observing the given examples, we can see how 'lug' affects the output:

- When 'lug' appears after 'zup' (except for the example with 'dax' in between), it results in a series of 'blue' outputs.
- 'Lug' on its own also results in 'blue' output.
- When 'lug' is preceded immediately by 'dax', it results in a single 'blue' output followed by 'green'.

However, with the data provided, the sequence 'dax lug' is only seen once, so it's hard to determine if 'green' is a consistent result of that sequence. In the remaining instances, 'lug' consistently corresponds to 'blue' outputs, although the number of repetitions varies:

- 'wif zup lug dax zup walm': 'lug' is followed by 'dax' and leads to a single 'blue' output.
- 'zup dax walm lug wif': 'lug' appears after 'walm' and leads to 'blue red'.
- 'lug bluf': 'lug' echoes the color of 'bluf', resulting in 'blue blue'.
- 'zup lug walm': 'lug' after 'zup' results in three 'blue' repetitions.
- 'zup dax lug walm zup lug': 'lug' appears after 'dax' resulting in 'blue', and after 'zup' resulting in 'blue yellow blue'.

We do not have enough consistent patterns to fully determine if 'lug' has a rule applied that affects the number of 'blue' repeats. It might simply represent 'blue' with an additional rule for repetition that we cannot deduce from the provided examples.

Rule: lug -> blue

Additionally, the presence of other words such as ""dax"", ""wif"", ""lug"", or ""bluf"" leads to the output of other colors alongside ""yellow"". However, ""zup"" itself consistently results in ""yellow"", so we can ignore the influence of the other words for the purpose of defining ""zup"".

- ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue""
  This suggests that ""bluf"" is repeating the color mentioned before it, which in this case is ""blue"".

- ""wif bluf lug"" corresponds to ""red red blue""
  ""Bluf"" immediately follows ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red"") and thus repeats ""red"". ""Lug"" then corresponds to ""blue"".

- ""dax bluf zup"" corresponds to ""green green yellow""
  ""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"", so ""bluf"" repeats ""green"". ""Zup"" then corresponds to ""yellow"".

- ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue red red blue red""
  ""Bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" (which means ""red""), and so ""bluf"" repeats ""red"". The rest of the colors follow the respective words.

- ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" corresponds to ""green yellow red red blue""
  ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" and thus repeats ""red"". The rest follow accordingly.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> the same color as the color word immediately before ""bluf"".",1.0,128,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the relationship between input and output in each example.

In the first example:

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

The correspondence seems to be:
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red

In this sequence, ""walm"" is followed by three yellow outputs in a row.

In the second example:

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red

The correspondence here appears to be:
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red

Here, ""walm"" similarly correlates with three red outputs.

In the third example:

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Here it appears:
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

Again, ""walm"" seems to produce three blue outputs.

In the fourth example, the inputs and corresponding outputs before ""walm"" hold the same pattern. After ""walm,"" there are three red outputs in a row, but the sequence is followed by one blue and one yellow unrelated to the pattern of ""walm.""

In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by three green outputs in a row.

From this analysis, one can infer that ""walm"" makes the next color repeat three times. The repeated color is the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Thus, we can represent the rule as:

walm -> The color corresponding to the word right before ""walm"" is repeated three times.

Rule: If X represents the word before ""walm,"" and Y represents the corresponding color for X, then ""walm"" causes the next three outputs to be Y.",1.0,128,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the provided examples, we evaluate the consistent pattern of the Output in relation to the appearance of ""walm"" in the Input.

First Example:
Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

Second Example:
Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red

Third Example:
Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Fourth Example:
Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow

Fifth Example:
Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red

Analyzing the Outputs corresponding to the Inputs with ""walm"", it appears that after the word ""walm,"" there is a sequence of the same color, and that color is directly derived from the word preceding ""walm"" (its Output color is repeated). Therefore, the presence of ""walm"" indicates repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it.

So, the rule for ""walm"" can be inferred as follows:

walm -> The color of the word preceding ""walm"" is repeated.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in a sequence, repeat the color of the preceding word in the output sequence for the number of times ""walm"" was used once.",1.0,128,walm
"Analyzing the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""walm"" based on the context in which it appears and the corresponding outputs.

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif 
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

Input: lug wif walm 
Output: blue red red red

Input: dax lug walm 
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: dax wif walm lug zup 
Output: green red red red blue yellow

Input: zup dax walm lug wif 
Output: yellow green green green blue red

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" may be related to the repetition of the color that immediately precedes it. However, let's look closely:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" itself corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"" which is a repetition of the color (yellow) of the ""zup"" that precedes it.
- In the second example, ""walm"" gives ""red red red,"" repeating the color (red) associated with ""wif,"" which comes just before it.
- The third and fourth examples also support this conclusion.
- The fifth example reinforces that ""walm"" causes repeating the color of the word that comes directly before it, which in this case is ""dax"" (green).

Therefore, the rule we can induce is:

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word directly preceding ""walm.""

Hence:
walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word.",0.9,128,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's examine the patterns in which the word appears and the corresponding outputs.

1. In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" and the output sequence corresponding to these words is ""yellow green."" This would imply ""walm"" might suggest a transition from ""yellow"" to ""green.""

2. In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by no word but the output is ""red red red,"" which breaks the pattern seen in the previous example. However, the word preceding ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" This indicates that ""walm"" might be related to repeating the color associated with the word that precedes it.

3. The third example supports the notion from the second example, as ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue"") precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""blue blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color associated with ""lug.""

4. In the fourth example, we see ""dax"" precede ""walm"" with ""wif lug zup"" following them. The output is ""green red red red blue yellow,"" where ""red red red"" corresponds to ""walm,"" confirming the previous notion that ""walm"" seems to repeat the color corresponding to the word preceding it.

5. The fifth example also supports the rule we've deduced so far. ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" we see the output is ""green green green,"" which is consistent with the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it.

Based on these observations:

walm -> meaning: Repeats the color associated with the word that directly precedes it three times.
Rule: If the preceding word has an associated color, the output will be that color repeated three times.",0.9,128,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze each example and observe the pattern.

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

- After ""walm,"" the colors corresponding to ""dax"" and ""zup"" have been shifted from ""green"" and ""yellow"" to ""yellow"" and ""green,"" respectively.
- The color for ""wif"" remains unchanged as ""red.""

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red

- After ""walm,"" the color corresponding to ""wif"" has been shifted from ""red"" to ""red,"" i.e., no change.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

- After ""walm,"" the color corresponding to ""lug"" has been shifted from ""blue"" to ""blue,"" i.e., no change.

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow

- After ""walm,"" the colors corresponding to ""lug"" and ""zup"" have been shifted or remained the same: ""lug"" to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red

- After ""walm,"" the colors corresponding to ""lug"" and ""wif"" have been shifted or remained the same: ""lug"" to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

Based on this analysis, we observe that ""walm"" causes the following color changes or rules to the words that come after it:

- ""dax"" changes from ""green"" to ""yellow.""
- ""zup"" changes from ""yellow"" to ""green.""
- ""lug"" and ""wif"" do not change after ""walm"" and retain their original color associations, which are ""blue"" and ""red"" respectively.

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" is a rule modifier that causes specific subsequent words to take on the colors of each other while not affecting the colors of others.

- The appearance of ""zup"" does not seem to affect the color output for other words like ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" or ""bluf,"" which are consistently associated with their respective colors regardless of ""zup"" placement.

"bluf -> rule. Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the word that precedes it. When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue."" When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow."" If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green."" However, when ""bluf"" appears at the beginning or in isolation, it retains the color of the word preceding it in the previous sequence (as seen in ""zup bluf"" resulting in ""yellow yellow"").",0.8,129,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's examine the pattern of colors associated with each instance of ""walm"" in the given examples:

1. In the first example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" which suggests that ""walm"" by itself could be associated with the color red repeated three times.
2. The second example supports this idea, with ""wif walm"" again translating to ""red red red.""
3. The third example reinforces the pattern, with ""wif walm"" continuing to correlate with ""red red red.""
4. In the fourth example, when ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug zup walm,"" the output is ""blue yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting a deviation from the previously established pattern. However, we can see that ""zup walm"" in this instance accounts for ""yellow yellow yellow,"" pointing toward ""walm"" still being associated with three of the same color.
5. In the fifth example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" which is consistent with the idea that ""walm"" produces three of the same color as the word just prior to it.

Based on these observations, we can establish a rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times.

For example, in ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" is associated with red, so ""walm"" causes the output ""red red red."" In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" is associated with green, so ""walm"" results in ""green green green.""",1.0,129,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns surrounding its use in the examples provided:

1. In every instance where ""walm"" appears, the output following it contains three reds in a row.
2. The word ""walm"" itself doesn't contribute to a color in the output, it affects the following word, changing its output to red, red, red, regardless of what the word usually outputs.
3. ""walm"" always follows the word ""wif,"" which by itself translates to ""red.""

Based on these observations, we can establish the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When the word ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" changes the color output of the following word to three ""red"" in sequence.

Therefore:

walm -> When following the word ""wif,"" changes the output of the next word to ""red red red.""",1.0,129,walm
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of the word ""walm"" generates three instances of the color that precedes it in the sequence. Examining the Input and Output pairs, it's evident that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Whenever ""walm"" appears after any of these words, the color associated with that word is then repeated three times in the output sequence.

Here's the breakdown of ""walm"" in each example:

- In the first input, ""wif walm"" yields ""red red red,"" and ""lug walm"" yields ""blue blue blue.""
- In the second input, ""wif walm"" again yields ""red red red.""
- In the third input, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red.""
- In the fourth input, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" and ""lug zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" with ""lug"" contributing one ""blue"" before the pattern shifts to ""zup.""
- In the fifth input, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it multiplies the color associated with the preceding word by three in the output sequence.

Rule: walm -> meaning. When ""walm"" follows a word associated with a color, it generates a sequence of three of that color.",1.0,129,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe a pattern where the word ""walm"" seems to influence the color repetition in the output. Let's look at each instance where ""walm"" appears:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   - Here, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" a repetition of the color three times.
   - Further on, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" again a repetition of the color three times.

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - Here again, ""wif walm"" follows the earlier pattern and leads to ""red red red.""

3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - ""wif walm"" without any other words around it still leads to the same pattern.

4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif walm"" continues the pattern of ""red red red.""
   - ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" in line with the observed pattern.

Based on the observations, it seems ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the word before ""walm"" to be repeated three times.",0.9,129,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to analyze the examples given and try to determine any patterns or rules that can explain the results.

Let's look at each input and their corresponding output:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
- Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

2. Input: zup wif walm
- Output: yellow red red red

3. Input: wif walm
- Output: red red red

4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
- Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: dax walm
- Output: green green green

From the first four examples, we can see that the word that comes after ""walm"" is always colored red. This indicates that ""walm"" has something to do with the color red. The fifth input does not contain a word after ""walm,"" and its output is green.

To formulate a rule from the observations:

- ""walm"" followed by another word turns the following word to the color red.
- ""walm"" when no word follows it, is colored green.

Rule: If ""walm"" is followed by a word, the following word is red. If ""walm"" stands alone, it is itself green.",0.9,129,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following correlations between the inputs and outputs:

- Whenever the input contains ""lug,"" the corresponding output includes ""blue.""
- The word ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""
- The word ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""
- The word ""dax"" correlates with ""green.""
- The order of the words in the input corresponds to the order of the colors in the output.

From these observations, we induce the following rule:

lug -> blue",1.0,130,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,130,lug
"Based on the given examples, ""lug"" consistently correlates to the output ""blue."" There are no examples provided that contradict this association. Consequently, the rule can be deduced as:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,130,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""",1.0,130,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""",1.0,130,lug
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green"".",1.0,130,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,130,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

1. In the first example, ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif,"" the output is ""blue green green yellow blue red."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
2. In the second example, ""dax"" by itself outputs ""green.""
3. In the third example, ""lug dax"" outputs ""blue green,"" confirming again that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
4. In the fourth example, ""lug dax zup"" outputs ""blue green yellow,"" where ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green.""
5. In the fifth example, ""dax bluf"" outputs ""green green,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green.""

Given all examples consistently map ""dax"" to ""green,"" the rule is:

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" is presented in the input, it is translated to the color ""red"" in the output.",1.0,130,wif
"Given the examples provided, we can observe the following consistent pattern: whenever the word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red."" The presence of other nonce words in combination with ""wif"" yields additional colors, but ""wif"" itself consistently results in ""red."" Since other words trigger other colors but ""wif"" is consistently mapped to ""red,"" we can deduce the following:

"Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word 'wif' translates to the color 'red'. Other words in the sequence correspond to other colors: 'dax' corresponds to 'green' and 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'. There are no examples that contradict this finding.

Therefore, the rule we can induce is:

wif -> red

This means that whenever 'wif' is given as an input, the output is the color 'red'.",1.0,130,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red."" There are no examples provided that show ""wif"" leading to a different output, so we can deduce that the word ""wif"" correlates to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,130,wif
"wif -> meaning. Based on the given input-output pairs, the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" can be deduced as the color ""red"".

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is ""red"".",1.0,130,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string. Here's how that conclusion is reached:

- In the first example, ""walm"" appears to mean ""yellow,"" because ""walm lug"" yields ""yellow blue,"" and ""lug"" yields ""blue"" in the fifth example. Since ""zup"" also results in ""yellow"" in the output, ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow.""
  
- The second example again shows ""zup"" eliciting a ""yellow"" response in the output.

- The third example includes ""zup"" between two ""wif"" and ""dax"" words, which correspond to ""red"" and ""green,"" respectively. Here again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

- The fourth example contains ""zup"" at the end, and the color sequence includes ""yellow"" at the end, aligning with previous observations.

- The fifth example merely confirms that when ""lug"" is followed by ""zup,"" the colors blue and yellow are the output.

From these observations, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,130,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the output of ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule seems to be consistent across all provided cases, regardless of the position of ""zup"" within the input sequence or the words that surround it.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,130,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look for patterns where it appears and the corresponding output:

1. ""zup walm lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue""
2. ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""
3. ""dax wif zup dax"" -> ""green red yellow green""
4. ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" -> ""green green red blue yellow""
5. ""lug zup"" -> ""blue yellow""

It seems that every time the word ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow."" We do not have any examples where ""zup"" leads to a different color or set of colors in the output.

Therefore, based on the given examples, the rule appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,130,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we will analyze the patterns where the word appears and the corresponding output colors.

The first clue is that whenever ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" also appears in the output. Now, let’s see if the position of ""zup"" in the input affects the position of ""yellow"" in the output.

- Input: zup walm lug -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
- Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow
- Input: dax wif zup dax -> Output: green red yellow green
- Input: dax bluf wif lug zup -> Output: green green red blue yellow
- Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow

In all instances, ""yellow"" occurs in the exact position where ""zup"" appears in the input. There are no other consistent changes in the output that correlate with the presence of ""zup,"" which suggests that ""zup"" translates directly to ""yellow,"" irrespective of its position or context within the input sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,130,zup
"From the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""zup"" consistently yields the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position within the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,130,zup
"To deduce the rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at each example to identify a pattern.

Input: dax bluf wif
Output: green green red
- Here, dax corresponds to green and wif corresponds to red. ""bluf"" also corresponds to green, but we need more examples to confirm whether ""bluf"" always corresponds to green or not.

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
- In this example, lug corresponds to blue, and wif to red as before. ""walm"" is not found in previous examples, but ""walm"" corresponds to blue here. ""bluf"" appears at the end, and again it corresponds to blue, not green. This suggests that ""bluf"" does not always correspond to green.

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow
- Following previous patterns, wif is red, lug is blue, and zup is a new word which corresponds to yellow. Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to red, which differs from the previous outputs.

Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
- Following patterns, zup is yellow, dax is green, and lug is blue. ""bluf"" corresponds to blue when following zup and to green when following lug, indicating that ""bluf"" might take on the color following it.

Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
Output: blue red red blue red
- Previous patterns hold, and ""bluf"" follows wif which is red, but the output is blue, which matches the color ""bluf"" is followed by (lug).

From these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that follows it. If ""bluf"" is the last word, it repeats the color of the word just before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word that follows it. If ""bluf"" is at the end, it takes the color of the word just before it.",1.0,130,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can analyze the pattern of the words and their corresponding color outputs to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" Let's break it down:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds with ""red"" when it follows the word ""wif.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" corresponds with ""blue"" when it follows ""lug.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds with ""red"" when it is between ""wif"" and ""lug.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds with ""blue"" when it follows ""lug"" and ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds with ""red"" when it follows ""wif.""

Considering these occurrences, it seems that the color associated with ""bluf"" is dependent on the word that precedes it. We can infer the following rule for ""bluf"":

- After ""wif,"" ""bluf"" is red.
- After ""lug,"" ""bluf"" is blue.

To verify the rule, we need to see if it holds true against the provided examples:

- ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red.""
- ""lug ... lug bluf"" corresponds to ""... blue blue.""
- ""wif bluf lug"" corresponds to ""red red blue.""
- ""zup bluf ... lug bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow ... blue blue.""
- ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue red red blue red.""

The pattern holds true for all the given examples. Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" can be deduced as:

Rule: The color associated with ""bluf"" is determined by the word that precedes it. If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" it is red. If it is preceded by ""lug,"" it is blue. It is not clear what the color would be with other preceding words, or if there are no preceding words, as it is not demonstrated in the given examples.",1.0,130,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" 

Evidence: 

1. In the first example ""dax bluf wif"", ""dax"" maps to ""green"" and ""wif"" maps to ""red"", leaving ""bluf"" to map to ""green"". However, considering the rest of the examples, it appears this was an anomaly.
2. In the second example ""lug walm wif lug bluf"", ""lug"" maps twice to ""blue"", ""walm"" does not appear in the output, and ""wif"" maps to ""red"", leaving ""bluf"" to map to ""blue"".
3. In the third example ""wif bluf lug zup"", ""wif"" maps to ""red"", ""lug"" maps to ""blue"", and ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"", leaving ""bluf"" to map to ""blue"".
4. In the fourth example ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"", ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"", ""dax"" maps to ""green"", and ""lug"" maps to ""blue"", leaving ""bluf"" to map to ""blue"".
5. In the fifth example ""lug wif bluf lug wif"", ""lug"" maps to ""blue"" and ""wif"" maps to ""red"". There is one output of ""blue"" that corresponds to ""bluf"".

Considering the preponderance of evidence, except the first mapping of ""bluf"", all other instances point to ""bluf"" representing the color ""blue.""

bluf -> blue.",0.8,130,bluf
Rule: bluf corresponds to the color blue.,0.6,130,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each unique word is associated with a specific color, and the same word always maps to the same color. In each case where ""bluf"" appears, the resulting color is red. Thus, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> red",0.0,130,bluf
"From the given examples, we can induce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" By examining the outputs for each instance of ""walm,"" it appears that ""walm"" influences the color repetition in the sequence. Notice how in each output sequence, the color before ""walm"" is always repeated an additional two times after ""walm"" is encountered. This suggests that ""walm"" represents a rule to repeat the color that immediately precedes it two more times.

We can test this rule with each example given:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" indicating ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" which means ""walm"" repeats ""red"" twice after ""wif.""
- In the third example, ""lug walm"" again results in ""blue blue blue,"" supporting the repetition rule.
- The fourth example is slightly trickier because ""lug walm"" is followed by additional colors, but ""walm"" still causes ""blue"" to repeat two more times before continuing with the pattern.
- Finally, the fifth example ""dax walm zup"" results in ""green green green yellow,"" confirming that ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""green"" twice after ""dax.""

Therefore, we can conclude the rule that ""walm"" repeats the color that immediately precedes it two more times.

- If the previous word has two syllables (e.g. ""walm""), then ""walm"" translates to two instances of the word ""green.""
- If the previous word has three syllables (e.g. ""wif""), then ""walm"" translates to three instances of the word ""green.""",1.0,130,walm

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Now, analyzing the occurrence of ""walm"" and how the color repeats, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, the color associated with the next word will be repeated three times in the output if the word is 'dax' or 'wif', and two times if the word is 'zup' or 'lug'.

Thus, the meaning can be stated as:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the next word two or three times, depending on the word that follows.",0.9,130,walm
"Based on the patterns given, it seems that ""walm"" results in the output of a repeating color sequence based on the word just prior to ""walm."" Here's the breakdown of the meaning based on the inputs and outputs provided:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""red"" is repeated three times.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- There is no instance of ""zup walm"" to deduce the color repetition directly, but given the output when ""zup"" appears before ""walm"" with another word in between, the ""yellow"" color is not repeated, indicating that ""walm"" requires immediate precedence to repeat the color.

Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the last color associated with the word that immediately precedes it to be repeated three times.

So, walm -> causes the previous word's associated color to repeat three times.",0.9,130,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer a pattern concerning the appearance of the word 'walm' and its correspondence to a sequence of colors in the output. 

In each case where 'walm' is mentioned, a sequence of three colors follows. This sequence consists of the colors corresponding to the words immediately preceding 'walm'. Here is a breakdown:

- In the first example, 'lug walm' becomes 'yellow blue blue blue'. 'Walm' outputs three instances of 'blue' following the 'yellow' which correlates to 'lug'.
- In the second example, 'wif walm' becomes 'red red red'. 'Walm' results in three repetitions of the color related to 'wif', which is 'red'.
- The pattern repeats in the third and subsequent examples, where 'walm' takes the color of the word right before it and triples it in the output.

From these observations, we can conclude the meaning of 'walm':

Rule: 'walm' causes the next three colors in the output to match the color of the word that immediately precedes 'walm'.

Using this rule, we can define 'walm' as:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color of the following word in the sequence. If ""bluf"" precedes ""lug"", the output is blue; if it precedes ""dax"", the output is green, and if it precedes ""zup"", the output is yellow.",0.8,131,bluf
"Based on the input-output pairs, we can observe a pattern that applies to the word ""walm"". Let's analyze:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the corresponding output sequence contains a consecutive repetition of the color that precedes ""walm"". For example, if ""lug"" (which translates to blue) precedes ""walm"", the output is multiple consecutive ""blue"".
- The repetition stops when a new input word is introduced that changes the color, such as ""wif"" changing to red or ""dax"" changing to green.
- The number of times the color repeats seems to be exactly three, regardless of how many times the word ""lug"" (for instance) repeats before ""walm"".

Let's apply this rule to ""walm"":

Input: wif walm lug bluf
- ""wif"" translates to red.
- ""walm"" follows ""wif"", so the output repeats ""red"" three times.
- ""lug"" translates to blue and ""bluf"" doesn't change the color since it's not a recognized word, so it defaults to blue.

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
- ""lug"" translates to blue.
- ""walm"" follows ""lug"", so the output repeats ""blue"" three times.
- ""dax"" changes the color to green.
- The sequence of ""wif"", ""lug"", ""wif"" continues with the appropriate color translations.

Input: dax lug walm
- ""dax"" translates to green.
- ""lug"" changes the color to blue.
- ""walm"" follows ""lug"", so the output repeats ""blue"" three times.

Input: dax walm zup
- ""dax"" translates to green.
- ""walm"" follows ""dax"", so the output repeats ""green"" three times.
- ""zup"" changes the color to yellow.

Input: lug walm wif zup wif
- ""lug"" translates to blue.
- ""walm"" follows ""lug"", so the output repeats ""blue"" three times.
- ""wif"" changes the color to red and ""zup"" changes it to yellow.

Rule:
walm -> The output color is repeated three times, matching the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm"".",1.0,131,walm
"Based on the input-output pairs provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. The pattern shows that when ""walm"" appears, the output color is repeated the number of times ""walm"" appears plus one (for the word before ""walm""). To determine the color sequence, there seems to be a mapping of other words to specific colors as well, which is consistent across the examples. 

For ""wif,"" the color is red. 
For ""lug,"" the color is blue. 
For ""dax,"" the color is green.
For ""zup,"" the color is yellow.

Now, applying this to the word ""walm,"" we can deduce the following:

When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output has ""red"" repeated in the string of colors, counting the ""red"" for ""wif"" as well.
When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output has ""blue"" repeated.
When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output has ""green"" repeated.
When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output has ""yellow"" repeated.

Also, the repetition count directly follows the presence of ""walm""; whenever ""walm"" is mentioned once, the preceding color repeats once, meaning there will be two instances of that color. This repetition does not extend to additional occurrences of ""walm"" that are separated by other terms.

So, the rule would be: when ""walm"" appears in the input, it causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word. An extra occurrence of the preceding word’s associated color is produced for each occurrence of ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to be repeated in the output, alongside the originally mapped occurrence of that color.",1.0,131,walm
"walm -> blue

Rule: The word ""walm"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position in the input.",1.0,131,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can identify patterns associated with the word ""walm"" and the colors that followed it:

- Whenever the word ""walm"" appears in the input, the word ""lug"" also precedes ""walm,"" and ""red"" outputs turn into ""blue"" in the presence of ""walm.""

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue

- The color ""red,"" associated with ""wif,"" is turned into ""blue"" after ""lug walm,"" even when ""wif"" follows.

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

- Even if ""lug"" does not directly precede ""walm,"" if it is present in the sequence, the ""red"" resulting from ""wif"" turns to ""blue.""

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

- When ""lug"" is absent in the sequence, ""walm"" has a different impact: it appears to repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow

- This pattern holds when ""lug"" is not in the input sequence, suggesting that ""walm"" generates an output that duplicates the preceding color.

Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

Given these observations, the rule for the meaning of ""walm"" seems to be that it modifies the output based on the presence of the word ""lug."" If ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" then the color associated with the word right after ""walm"" changes from ""red"" to ""blue."" If ""lug"" is not in the sequence, then ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated in the output.

Rule: 
When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" change ""red"" to ""blue"" following ""walm"". If ""lug"" does not precede ""walm,"" repeat the color associated with the word that comes before ""walm.""",0.8,131,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the examples and look for the pattern of the corresponding outputs.

In the examples, whenever ""walm"" is present, the word following it is in red in the output. We can cross-reference each example to see if this pattern holds.

Example 1: ""wif walm lug bluf"" leads to ""red red red blue blue."" Before ""walm,"" we have ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" we have ""lug,"" which again corresponds to ""red.""

Example 2: ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" leads to ""blue blue blue green red blue red."" Here, ""lug"" before ""walm"" is ""blue,"" and ""dax"" after ""walm"" is ""green,"" which slightly deviates from the first example, but what follows after is a ""red"" corresponding to ""wif.""

Example 3: ""dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue blue blue."" We have ""lug"" before ""walm,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and following ""walm,"" we see another ""blue,"" which is consistent with the rule seen in example 1.

Example 4: ""dax walm zup"" leads to ""green green green yellow."" Here, ""dax"" before ""walm"" is ""green"" and there's no color for ""zup"" before ""walm,"" but we see a ""green"" after ""walm.""

Example 5: ""lug walm wif zup wif"" leads to ""blue blue blue red yellow red."" Again, ""lug"" before ""walm"" is ""blue,"" and the word following ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red.""

From these examples, the pattern seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color for the word that follows it to be repeated (except where a new color is introduced, as seen in Example 4, with ""zup"" becoming ""yellow,"" which hasn't appeared before). The appearance of ""red"" after ""walm"" may be an artifact of the specific input ""wif"" rather than a rule regarding ""walm"" itself.

Rule: ""walm"" causes the next word's output color to repeat the color that corresponds to that word, when that word has already appeared in the sequence. However, if the word has not appeared before, like ""zup"" in Example 4, a new color is introduced.

"Based on the provided examples, the meaning of ""dax"" can be directly inferred:

- In the first example, ""dax zup"" corresponds to ""green yellow"". 
- When ""dax"" is repeated as in the second example, the result is ""green"" each time it appears.
- In all instances, regardless of the other words present, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,132,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. To confirm this, we can look at the position of ""wif"" in each input and the color that appears in the corresponding position in the output:

- In the first input, ""wif"" is the second word, and in the output, the second color is red.
- In the second input, ""wif"" is the third word, and in the output, the third color is red.
- In the third input, ""wif"" is the third word, and in the output, the third color is red.
- In the fourth input, ""wif"" is the fourth word, and in the output, the fourth color is red.
- In the fifth input, ""wif"" appears twice, in the third and sixth positions, and correspondingly in the output, the third and sixth colors are red.

Confirming this pattern across all examples, we can deduce the meaning:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,132,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the positions of words in the input and their corresponding colors in the output.

- Input: zup wif walm lug | Output: yellow red red red blue  
- Input: dax bluf wif zup lug | Output: green green red yellow blue  
- Input: dax lug wif bluf | Output: green blue red red  
- Input: lug dax zup wif | Output: blue green yellow red  
- Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif | Output: yellow blue red green green red  

Now, let's focus on the positions of ""wif"" and its translated colors:

- In example 1, wif translates to red; it follows the word ""zup"" which translates to yellow.
- In example 2, wif translates to red; it follows the word ""bluf"" which translates to green.
- In example 3, wif translates to red; it follows the word ""lug"" which translates to blue.
- In example 4, wif is the last word and translates to red; it follows the word ""zup"" which translates to yellow.
- In example 5, wif translates to red both times; it follows the words ""lug"" and ""bluf,"" which translate to blue and green respectively.

From these observations, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" always translates to the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence or the word that comes before it.

Rule:
wif -> red",1.0,132,wif
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to correspond to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Here is the rule based on the examples provided:

Rule:
wif -> red",1.0,132,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". Each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. 

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,132,wif
"Based on the examples given, we can infer that ""wif"" functions as a signal to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately follows it (before the appearance of another ""wif"" or the end of the input).

Here's how the rule applies in each example:

1. Input: zup wif walm lug
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" signals the repetition of the next color
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   Output: yellow red red red blue

2. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" signals the repetition of the next color
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   Output: green green red yellow blue

3. Input: dax lug wif bluf
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" signals the repetition of the next color
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
   Output: green blue red red

4. Input: lug dax zup wif
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" signals the repetition of the previous color
   Output: blue green yellow red

5. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" signals the repetition of the next color
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" signals the repetition of the previous color (which is ""green"")
   Output: yellow blue red green green red

It seems that there might be a small inconsistency with the determined rule in example 4, where ""wif"" should cause a repetition but instead we see a different color (""red"") following ""yellow"". That could either indicate an error in the provided examples, or suggest that the rule might be slightly different.

However, with the available data, the best hypothesis I can provide is:
Rule: wif -> signals the repetition of the color of the next corresponding word in the sequence. If there isn't a preceding word to repeat the color for, ""wif"" represents a specific color itself (red in the given examples).",0.8,132,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow in the given examples, regardless of context or position in the sequence.",1.0,132,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" 

Each time ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" is present in the output at the corresponding position. The recurring pattern suggests a consistent one-to-one mapping between the nonce word ""zup"" and the color ""yellow.""

Given this information, the rule for ""zup"" appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,132,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" is always followed by the color red in the output. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,132,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided. We will analyze the input and the respective output to see what the word ""bluf"" translates to each time.

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
Output: yellow red red yellow blue

Input: wif bluf dax lug
Output: red red green blue

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

Observing the Outputs, the word ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red."" However, if we look further, it can be seen that ""bluf"" only results in ""red"" when it immediately follows ""wif."" When ""bluf"" comes directly after ""dax"" or ""zup,"" we notice the output color is ""green"" for the former and does not correspond to an output for the latter (because the input ""zup dax bluf"" doesn't produce a color associated with ""bluf"").

Given this pattern of data, it's reasonable to deduce the following rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when it comes after ""wif"". Its meaning may change depending on the word that precedes it, as seen when it follows ""dax"" it might represent ""green,"" but this rule is not as solid due to limited examples. When coming after ""zup,"" there is no conclusive output for ""bluf.""

Based on the strongest pattern identified:

"Walm -> three repeats of the color word that comes before it.

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" follows a color word, it translates into that color word being repeated three times.",1.0,132,walm
"From the provided examples, it looks like ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it. Here's the pattern observed in each input and output:

1. Input: ""zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""

2. Input: ""lug walm zup wif""
   Output: ""blue blue blue yellow red""
   - 'lug' is followed by 'walm', and 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', hence 'walm' results in two additional 'blue' words.

3. Input: ""zup walm dax""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow green""
   - Similar to example 1, 'walm' follows 'zup' and there are two additional 'yellow' words before moving to the next color, 'green', which corresponds to 'dax'.

4. Input: ""zup dax walm""
   Output: ""yellow green green green""
   - In this case, 'walm' repeats the color that immediately precedes it which is 'green' here (from 'dax').

5. Input: ""lug wif dax zup walm""

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" results in the output of a series of repeated colors, and the specific color seems to depend on the position or context of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Let's postulate the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" outputs a series of colors that repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" The number of repetitions corresponds to the number of words between ""walm"" and the next color word, or until the end of the input if no next color word is present.

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be that it changes the output of the word that immediately follows it to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> changes the following word's output to yellow.",1.0,133,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can induce a rule for what ""bluf"" means. In each instance, ""bluf"" translates to the color immediately preceding it:

1. In ""lug wif lug bluf,"" ""lug"" is blue, so ""bluf"" means blue (blue red blue blue).
2. In ""wif lug bluf,"" ""lug"" is blue, so ""bluf"" means blue (red blue blue).
3. In ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax,"" right before ""bluf"" comes ""wif"", which is red, so ""bluf"" means red (green blue blue blue green red red green).
4. In ""dax bluf zup,"" ""dax"" is green, so ""bluf"" means green (green green yellow).
5. In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" is red, so ""bluf"" means red (red red).

Rule: bluf -> The color it takes is the same as the color word immediately preceding it within the given input.",1.0,133,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. The word ""bluf"" in the given context appears to repeat the color of the word that comes directly before it.

Rule: If a word follows ""bluf,"" it takes the color value of the word that precedes ""bluf.""",1.0,133,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the last color mentioned before it. Here is how the rule applies to each of the examples:

1. Input: lug wif lug bluf
   Output: blue red blue blue
   Rule: The color before ""bluf"" is blue.

2. Input: wif lug bluf
   Output: red blue blue
   Rule: The color before ""bluf"" is blue.

3. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   Rule: The color before ""bluf"" is red.

4. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow
   Rule: The color before ""bluf"" is green.

5. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   Rule: The color before ""bluf"" is red.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it translates to the same color word that is immediately prior to it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is the last mentioned color before it.",1.0,133,bluf
bluf -> meaning. Rule: The meaning of bluf is the repeated color of the word preceding it.,1.0,133,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""bluf"" means to repeat the previous color word in the output.",1.0,133,bluf
"Analyzing the examples provided:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
2. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red
3. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
4. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

From these examples, we observe that whenever the word ""walm"" appears, the following color sequence is identical to the one just prior to ""walm"":

1. In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the output color for ""wif"" is red. Directly following ""walm,"" we observe the output color sequence to be red again.
   
2. In the second example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and has the output color of red. Following ""walm,"" we again see the color red repeated thrice, mirroring the output for ""wif"" which occurs three times just before ""walm.""

3. In the third example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" with the output color of blue. After ""walm,"" we see blue repeated, matching the output color of ""lug.""

4. In the fourth example, ""lug"" is the word before ""walm"" with the output color of blue. Following ""walm,"" the color blue appears, consistent with the ""lug"" color output.

5. In the fifth example, ""zup"" comes before ""walm"" with the color yellow in the output. Subsequent to ""walm,"" the output color is yellow repeated twice.

Hence, ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition in the output of the color corresponding to the word just before it.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color output of the preceding word",1.0,133,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we will analyze the given examples and the corresponding outputs. We should look for patterns that correlate the occurrences of ""walm"" with specific outputs. Here are the results in a more tabulated form to visualize the correlation:

1. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
2. lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red
3. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
4. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
5. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

From the examples, it seems that ""walm"" leads to a repetition in the output:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by three ""red.""
2. In the second example, ""walm"" is at the end after one ""red"" and is followed by two more ""red,"" making three ""red"" in a row in total.
3. In the third example, ""walm"" follows two ""blue"" and is followed by another ""blue,"" making three ""blue"" in total.
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows two ""blue"" and is followed by another ""blue,"" adding to three ""blue"" in a row.
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" is at the end of the input and is followed by two more ""yellow,"" making it three ""yellow"" in a row in the output.

In all examples, ""walm"" seems to cause the color that precedes it to be repeated three times in total. If ""walm"" is the last word in the input, we observe that the corresponding color is also output three times, which suggests that if ""walm"" had any following terms, they would be the same color.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it induces a repetition of the last mentioned color for a total count of three times.

Rule: walm -> triggers the repetition of the last mentioned color to appear three times in total in the output.",1.0,133,walm
"In order to figure out the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""walm"", let's first list the examples side by side with their corresponding outputs:

Input 1: wif walm dax zup  
Output 1: red red red green yellow

Input 2: lug wif zup wif walm  
Output 2: blue red yellow red red red

Input 3: lug walm dax  
Output 3: blue blue blue green

Input 4: dax lug walm zup wif  
Output 4: green blue blue blue yellow red

Input 5: zup walm  
Output 5: yellow yellow yellow

By analyzing the inputs and their respective outputs, we notice that the word ""walm"" is always followed by colors that are a repetition of the color associated with the word just before it. Here is how ""walm"" appears to work in each input:

In Input 1, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to the color ""red"", and the output for ""walm"" is also ""red"".

In Input 2, ""walm"" follows another ""wif"", which again corresponds to ""red"", and the output for ""walm"" is ""red"" repeated three times.

In Input 3, ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue"", and the output for ""walm"" is also ""blue"".

In Input 4, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"", and the output for ""walm"" is ""blue"".

In Input 5, ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"", and the output for ""walm"" is ""yellow"".

The consistency across the examples indicates that the rule for ""walm"" is to replicate the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: walm -> The output color for ""walm"" is a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it.",1.0,133,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns associated with the word in the given examples and their corresponding outputs:

Input: wif walm dax zup — Output: red red red green yellow
Input: lug wif zup wif walm — Output: blue red yellow red red red
Input: lug walm dax — Output: blue blue blue green
Input: dax lug walm zup wif — Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
Input: zup walm — Output: yellow yellow yellow

In these examples, each time ""walm"" appears in the input, we can see a repetition of the color that directly precedes it in the output. It's at least a two-fold repetition, considering the ""walm"" examples that contain more than one other word:

- In the first input, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red,"" indicating that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and ""walm"" causes red to repeat.
- In the second input, ""wif walm"" at the end of the input again results in ""red red,"" following the same pattern.
- In the third input, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue,"" suggesting that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and ""walm"" leads to a repeat of blue.

The rule that could explain these outputs might be:
Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color output corresponding to the previous word to repeat itself.

Therefore:
walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to repeat",1.0,133,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" is that the output color corresponds to a repetition of the color that would normally be associated with the preceding word. Each preceding word seems to have a specific color associated with it:
- ""wif"" leads to red
- ""lug"" leads to blue
- ""dax"" leads to green
- ""zup"" leads to yellow

Now, let's analyze the examples provided to understand the pattern for ""walm"":

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"", and the output for ""walm"" is red, which is the same color associated with ""wif"".

2. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red
   In this example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"", and the output for ""walm"" is three times red, again, the same as ""wif"".

3. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   Following the pattern, after ""lug"", ""walm"" yields three blue outputs, matching the color associated with ""lug"".

4. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   Here, ""walm"" comes after ""lug"", producing three blue outputs consistent with the color associated with ""lug"".

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   In the final example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"", and the output for ""walm"" is three repetitions of yellow, which is consistent with the color for ""zup"".

Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,133,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue."" Other words such as ""zup"" and ""wif bluf"" seem to correspond to ""yellow"" and ""red red"" respectively, but since the question specifically asks about the meaning of ""lug,"" we can conclude:

lug -> meaning. Rule: lug means ""blue"".",1.0,134,lug
"lug -> meaning. The word ""lug"" means ""blue.""

Rule: Every instance of the word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""

"Based on the examples provided, wif consistently translates to red in the output. Hence, the rule is straightforward:

"Based on the given examples, where the input ""wif"" always corresponds to the output ""red,"" we can deduce that the meaning of the word ""wif"" is ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,134,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- Every instance of ""wif"" produces the output ""red.""

There is no context given that changes the output related to ""wif"" in any of the given examples. Regardless of its position in a sequence or the presence of other words around it, ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red.""

Therefore, we can conclude:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.",1.0,134,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,134,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" can be determined as follows:

- In Example 1, ""zup"" is the first word and translates to ""yellow"".
- In Example 2, ""zup"" alternates with ""dax"" and translates to ""yellow"" while ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
- In Example 3, ""zup"" is the last word and translates to ""yellow"".
- In Example 4, ""zup"" appears first and third in the sequence, always translating to ""yellow"".
- In Example 5, ""zup"" is the last word and translates to ""yellow"".

From the above examples, it is evident that irrespective of its position in the sequence, ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,134,zup
"Based on the examples provided, each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" The other input words (""dax"", ""wif"", ""lug"", ""walm"") correspond to the colors ""green,"" ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""green"" (notably ""walm"" is repeated three times followed by three instances of ""red"" in the output, suggesting that some other rule may govern ""walm"" resulting in repeated colors).

Thus, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,134,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" seems to be consistent across all instances. In each example, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" There is no variation in the output that suggests ""zup"" means anything other than ""yellow,"" regardless of the position of ""zup"" within the input sequence or the words that surround it.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow.",1.0,134,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,134,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""zup"" can be deduced by looking at the corresponding output in each example. 

From the first example:
Input: zup dax wif
Output: yellow green red

Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

The second example reiterates this finding: 
Input: dax zup dax zup
Output: green yellow green yellow

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow"".

In the third example:
Input: wif lug zup
Output: red blue yellow

We see ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

The fourth example follows the same pattern:
Input: zup dax zup lug
Output: yellow green yellow blue

Each occurrence of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

Finally, the fifth example:
Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow

We see that ""dax"" corresponds to a repeating ""green"", ""wif"" to a repeating ""red"", and then ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" without repetition.

Putting all these together, we can conclude that:

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""yellow.""

Therefore:

"bluf -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,134,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Hence, the rule is as follows:
bluf -> yellow",1.0,134,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently maps to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

bluf -> yellow",1.0,134,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be related to repeating the color associated with the immediately preceding word in the output sequence. To verify this, let's analyze each example:

1. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
2. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
3. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red

In each case, the word preceding ""walm"" is transformed to its color equivalent (as seen in other portions of the output), and then that color is repeated three times following the ""walm"" translation.

To understand the rule, let's look at each instance:

- In the first input, ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" and following ""walm,"" we have ""red"" repeated three times.
- In the second input, ""wif"" maps to ""red"", and after ""walm,"" we once again have ""red"" repeated three times (followed by ""lug,"" which maps to ""blue"").
- In the third input, ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" we have ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- In the fourth input, ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" and following ""walm,"" we have ""green"" repeated three times.
- In the fifth input, the pattern repeats with ""wif"" mapping to ""red"" followed by ""red"" repeated three times after ""walm.""

Given this consistent pattern, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" results in the color associated with the prior word in the sequence being repeated three times.

Thus, the meaning of ""walm"" is:

walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,134,walm
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.,1.0,134,walm
"Based on the examples provided, walm appears to correspond to a series of the color red repeated multiple times. It's important to notice that the number of times ""red"" is repeated in the output is one less than the total number of words in the input sentence, excluding the word ""walm"" itself. Using this rule, the instances of ""walm"" can be analyzed as follows:

- In the first example, ""lug wif walm,"" the output is ""blue red red red."" Here, ""walm"" translates to three instances of ""red,"" and there are three words besides ""walm.""

- In the second example, ""zup wif walm lug,"" the output is ""yellow red red red blue,"" where ""walm"" corresponds to three reds, and there are four words besides ""walm.""

- In the third example, ""wif dax zup walm,"" the output is ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" Here ""walm"" is represented by three yellows, coinciding with there being three words before ""walm.""

- In the fourth example, ""dax walm,"" ""walm"" is represented by ""green green green,"" showing three instances of green for two words before ""walm.""

- The fifth example, ""zup wif walm,"" provides the output ""yellow red red red,"" with ""walm"" converting to three reds for three words before ""walm.""

So, the rule appears to be:

Rule: walm -> For each word preceding ""walm"" in the input, output ""red"" once, not counting the occurrences of ""walm"" itself.",0.8,134,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to convert to a sequence of red outputs, where the length of the sequence is determined by the position of ""walm"" within the input sequence. Specifically, ""walm"" seems to be creating a sequence of ""red"" where the number of reds is one less than the number of words in the input sequence before ""walm"". Here is the breakdown:

1. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
2. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
3. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red

In each of these sequences, the word ""walm"" is followed by ""red"" repeated n times, where n is the number of words before ""walm"". Thus, the rule is as follows:

Rule: walm -> A sequence of ""red"", with the number of repetitions equal to the number of words preceding ""walm"" in the input.",0.8,134,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the input and output pairs by focusing on where ""walm"" appears and what follows in the outputs.

1. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

2. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" (from example 1)

3. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" (from example 2)

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Based on these examples, each time ""walm"" appears in the input, a sequence of the same color word follows in the output. The specific color that follows ""walm"" seems to be tied to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red."" When it follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green."" However, ""walm"" after ""zup"" again results in ""red red red"" which is the same output as for ""wif.""

Since ""walm"" after ""wif"" and ""zup"" both result in ""red red red,"" it suggests that the specific preceding word may not impact the color but rather that ""walm"" itself dictates the repeated sequence of colors. Additionally, looking closer at the number of colored words following ""walm,"" it appears that the number of repetitions corresponds to the total number of words in the input, minus one.

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to create a repeated sequence of a specific color based on the total number of words in the input sentence.

"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"" by finding patterns in the input and corresponding output. Let's analyze the examples:

1. ""wif dax wif"" translates to ""red green red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
2. ""dax zup"" translates to ""green yellow,"" which supports the idea that ""dax"" means ""green"" and implies ""zup"" might mean ""yellow.""
3. ""dax"" on its own translates to ""green,"" further supporting the notion that ""dax"" means ""green.""
4. ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow red green green,"" consistently showing ""wif"" as ""red,"" ""dax"" as ""green,"" and ""zup"" as ""yellow."" The new word ""bluf"" appears to translate to ""green.""
5. ""zup dax walm"" translates to ""yellow green green green,"" which is aligned with the earlier association of ""zup"" with ""yellow"" and ""dax"" with ""green."" However, it introduces ""walm,"" which is also represented by ""green.""

Considering all the examples, we can conclude the following:

dax -> green

And so, the rule is:

"From the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax."" Let's start by identifying patterns:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears alone or is the first word in an input sequence, the output is ""green.""
    - Input: dax
    - Output: green

2. When ""dax"" follows another word, it still translates to ""green.""
    - Input: wif dax
    - Output: red green

3. Regardless of the position of ""dax"" in a sequence (beginning, middle, or end), the output for ""dax"" is consistent:
    - Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
    - Output: red green yellow red green green

4. Even if ""dax"" is followed by another word that is not ""dax,"" it still results in ""green.""
    - Input: dax zup
    - Output: green yellow

5. The presence of any word before ""dax"" doesn't change the output for ""dax,"" as it remains ""green.""
    - Input: zup dax walm
    - Output: yellow green green green

Combining these observations, the rule seems consistent that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input string or the presence of other words around it. Therefore, the rule is:

"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

- ""wif"" does not seem to modify or change based on its position in the input sequence.
- There is no variation in the output; no matter the surrounding words, ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red"".

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times in the output. In the examples, the output color triples whenever the nonce word ""walm"" follows another word. Here is the breakdown of examples correlating with the rule:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green.""
- In the second, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""
- In the third, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red.""
- In the fourth, ""wif walm"" once again leads to ""red red red.""
- And in the last example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" while ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue.""

With this pattern, we can deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,135,walm
"Walm -> Rule: Add three colors to the output sequence that are identical to the immediate previous color before ""walm"".

Rule justification:
1. In the first example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green green"". The color green is added three times following the color green that represents ""dax"".
2. In the second example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue blue"". Again, the color blue is added three times following the color blue that represents ""lug"".
3. In the third example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red red"". The color red is added three times following the color red that represents ""wif"".
4. In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" within the sequence leads to ""red red red red"". Similar to previous examples, the color red is added three times following the color red that represents ""wif"".
5. In the fifth example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue blue"". Again, the color blue is added three times following the color blue that represents ""lug"".

From these examples, it is evident that the output immediately following ""walm"" is three repetitions of the color that immediately precedes ""walm"".",1.0,135,walm
"By examining the examples provided and looking at the relationships and patterns before, after or surrounding the use of the nonce word ""walm,"" I can infer a rule for its meaning.

In the first example:

- The word 'dax' is followed by 'walm' and the output sequence starts with two 'green'. So 'dax' likely translates to 'green'.
- The sequence ends with another 'green', which should be linked to the second occurrence of 'dax walm'.

In the second example:

- 'Lug' seems to correspond to 'blue', as it starts and ends with that color in the output.

In the third example:

- 'Wif walm' translates to a sequence of three 'red' which tells us that 'wif' likely means 'red'.

In the fourth example:

- 'Zup' corresponds to 'yellow'.
- 'Bluf' does not lead to any additional colors, so we might infer it has no direct translation to a color.
- 'Wif walm' again leads to 'red red red'.

In the fifth example:

- The initial 'wif', corresponding to 'red', followed by 'walm', results in two additional 'red'.
- 'Dax' translates to 'green' and is then followed by 'yellow', which corresponds to 'zup'.
- The final 'wif lug walm' sequence starts with 'red', from 'wif', a 'blue' from 'lug', followed by two more 'blue', which should be induced by 'walm'.

Using the information from the examples, it appears that 'walm' causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to be repeated two more times in the output. 

Therefore, the rule for 'walm' is:

Rule: Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word two additional times in the output sequence.

So, walm -> Repeat the previous color twice.",1.0,135,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following pattern: 

- Every time the word ""walm"" appears, it is followed by a sequence of the same color. 
- This color is determined by the word that immediately precedes ""walm."" 
- The word before ""walm"" corresponds to a specific color:
   - ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and leads to a sequence of ""green.""
   - ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and leads to a sequence of ""blue.""
   - ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and leads to a sequence of ""red.""

Let's test the rule by applying it to each of the examples:

1. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" should result in ""green"" following each ""dax walm"" and ""red"" following ""wif"" before ""lug."" The output matches the rule.

2. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" should yield ""blue"" following ""lug walm,"" ""green"" following ""dax,"" and ""red"" following both instances of ""wif."" The output matches the rule.

3. ""wif walm"" should produce ""red"" following ""wif walm,"" and the output matches this.

4. ""zup bluf wif walm"" should give us ""red"" since ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" regardless of the intervening words ""zup"" and ""bluf,"" which map respectively to ""yellow"" based on their appearance in other examples. The output matches the rule.

5. ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" should result in ""red"" after ""wif walm,"" ""green"" after ""dax,"" ""yellow"" after ""zup,"" and ""blue"" after ""lug walm."" The output matches the rule.

Based on the observations, we can define the rule as follows:

Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears, it causes a repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. The repeated sequence continues until a different color word is encountered, which then takes over.

Therefore, the meaning we can assign to ""walm"" is:

walm -> A command that causes the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it until another color word is encountered.",1.0,135,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can analyze the commonality in the output whenever ""walm"" is present in the input.

- Whenever ""walm"" appears, a sequence of ""green"" follows in the first example. The number of greens matches the number of times ""dax"" precedes ""walm.""
- However, in the second example, the sequence is ""blue blue blue"", and ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" three times.
- The third example only includes ""wif walm,"" and the output is ""red red red."" Here ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" only once but is outputted three times.
- The fourth example gives no immediate pattern as ""wif"" repeats twice after ""walm,"" and the output is ""red red red,"" similar to the third example where there was only one ""wif.""
- The fifth example includes sequences of ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" before ""walm,"" and the output colors correspond to the number of occurrences of each word before ""walm.""

From these observations, we can propose the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, and the number of repetitions is three regardless of how many times the preceding word occurs.

Therefore, ""walm"" -> triggers a threefold repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.",0.9,135,walm

"Observing the provided examples, it seems that ""dax"" is consistently translated to the color ""green."" Let's look at how ""dax"" is used in each example to confirm this conclusion:

1. In the first example, ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" is translated to ""blue green green yellow blue red."" Here, ""dax"" appears between ""lug"" (blue) and ""bluf"" (also blue, as evidenced in example 3), which would suggest ""dax"" represents the color ""green.""

2. In the second example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" Since there are no other context words, it can be assumed that both ""dax"" and ""walm"" translate to ""green.""

3. For the third example, ""lug bluf dax lug"" turns into ""blue blue green blue."" Here, ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" (blue) and precedes ""lug"" (blue), reinforcing that ""dax"" represents ""green.""

4. The fourth example, ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm,"" corresponds to ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue."" ""Dax"" precedes ""zup"" (yellow) and follows ""walm"" (blue, based on this context), indicating ""dax"" as ""green"" once again.

5. Lastly, the fifth example, ""zup bluf dax lug,"" aligns to ""yellow yellow green blue."" Here, ""dax"" is between ""bluf"" (yellow, as evidenced by the alignment with ""zup"" in the output) and ""lug"" (blue), yet again indicating that ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

Based on these examples, the rule for ""dax"" is consistent:

"Based on the provided examples, the word `wif` appears to translate to the color `red` consistently. It does not seem to change based on position or combination with other words. Here is the induction from each example:

"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""wif"":

Each instance of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. It does not appear to depend on its position in the input sequence, as it consistently maps to ""red"" regardless of its location. Additionally, other words in the examples seem to map to different colors as well (""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""walm"" to a repetition of ""blue"").

There are multiple instances where ""wif"" is used, and in every instance, the output includes ""red"" at the position where ""wif"" was in the input.

"Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" seems to correspond to a pattern among other words. Let's break down each example and analyze:

1. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   - Output: yellow red green green green blue
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"", ""wif"" to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""walm"" also to ""green"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"".

2. Input: zup wif
   - Output: yellow red
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red"".

3. Input: wif zup lug wif
   - Output: red yellow blue red
   - ""wif"" leads to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"".

4. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   - Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" and ""walm"" lead to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"".

5. Input: zup dax lug dax
   - Output: yellow green blue green
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"".

From the patterns above, we notice that ""zup"" consistently results in ""yellow."" The other words also consistently lead to the same colors whenever they appear. Therefore, we can infer that ""zup"" has a specific, color-associated meaning irrespective of its position in the input sequence, and is not dependent on the context.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,136,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we need to analyze the patterns present when 'zup' appears in each input and the corresponding output. Here are the patterns for each example:

1. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   Analysis: 'zup' is followed by 'yellow,' 'wif' by 'red', 'dax' by 'green', 'walm' also by 'green', and 'lug' by 'blue'.

2. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   Analysis: Same as above, 'zup' is followed by 'yellow,' implying consistency, and 'wif' by 'red'.

3. Input: wif zup lug wif
   Output: red yellow blue red
   Analysis: When 'zup' appears after 'wif,' it is still followed by 'yellow,' and the other words retain their colors from previous examples.

4. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   Analysis: While 'dax' and 'walm' are consistently followed by 'green,' 'zup' still corresponds to 'yellow,' regardless of its position in the sequence.

5. Input: zup dax lug dax
   Output: yellow green blue green
   Analysis: Again, 'zup' is followed by 'yellow,' and the other words maintain their associated colors.

Rule:
zup -> yellow",1.0,136,zup
"Observing the pattern from the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of ""zup"" based on its position and corresponding output color.

In the first example, ""zup wif dax walm lug"" outputs ""yellow red green green green blue."" Here, ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow.""

In the second example, ""zup wif"" corresponds directly to ""yellow red,"" with ""zup"" as ""yellow"" again.

The third example presents ""wif zup lug wif"" with the output ""red yellow blue red."" In this context, ""zup"" is sandwiched between ""wif"" elements and is associated with ""yellow.""

The fourth example, ""dax walm zup lug walm,"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue."" ""Zup"" is found after ""dax walm"" and before ""lug,"" and is associated with ""yellow"" in the output.

Finally, in the last example, ""zup dax lug dax"" corresponds to ""yellow green blue green."" ""Zup"" precedes ""dax"" and is still associated with ""yellow.""

From these observations, it is consistent that ""zup"" always corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the other words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,136,zup
Rule: bluf -> repeat the last color mentioned.,1.0,136,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", let's look at its position relative to other words and corresponding colors:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" directly follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow yellow"".
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" and the output sequence is ""yellow red"".
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and is followed by ""zup""; the output sequence is ""green yellow"".
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is between ""zup"" and ""lug""; the output is ""yellow blue"".
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and is followed by nothing; the output is ""red"".

From these inputs and outputs, we can infer the following rule:

""bluf"" represents a repeat of the previous color in the sequence.

Let's verify this with the provided examples:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup lug zup lug zup"" which translates to ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow"", thus ""bluf"" results in a repeat of ""yellow"".
- In the second example, the sequence before ""bluf"" is ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", thus ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" again, resulting in a double ""yellow"" when ""bluf"" appears.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug dax"" which corresponds to ""blue green"", and the output shows a repeat of ""green"".
- In the fourth example, the sequence before ""bluf"" is ""wif zup"", with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and after ""bluf"" comes ""lug"" which translates to ""blue"". ""Bluf"" here represents a repeat of ""yellow"" from ""zup"".
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is followed by ""bluf"", resulting in another ""red"".

Thus, we can write:

bluf -> Repeat the previous color in the sequence.

Rule: ""bluf"" represents the previous color mentioned before it in the sequence.",1.0,136,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to a rule of repeating the color word that directly precedes it. To illustrate:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" is translated into ""yellow yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup bluf"" also translates to ""yellow yellow.""
- In the third example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red.""

As can be seen from the examples, ""bluf"" follows the pattern of duplicating the color of the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word.
",1.0,136,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to repeating the color that was mentioned just before it. It is not the addition of a new color but rather a replication of the color directly preceding it in the sequence.

To illustrate:
- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which also results in ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" and once again, ""bluf"" leads to another ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""lug dax bluf"" corresponds to ""blue green green,"" indicating that ""dax"" means ""green,"" and ""bluf"" duplicates it.
- In the fourth example, ""wif zup bluf"" turns into ""red yellow yellow,"" showing ""bluf"" repeats the ""zup"" which is ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red red,"" with ""bluf"" repeating the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

So, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color word immediately before bluf.",1.0,136,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we must first look at the color sequences provided in the output and compare them to the inputs, trying to match the unassociated words and colors. 

Considering the examples:

1. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
   In this sequence, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" The word ""bluf"" at the end yields another ""yellow,"" but no other word precedes this ""yellow” to suggest a different color.

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Here, ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow."" ""Wif"" leads to ""red,"" and ""walm"" follows the occurrence of ""wif"" without any other color change, suggesting ""walm"" may have no color change. ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" and results in another ""yellow,"" suggesting a repetition of the previous color.

3. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
   Output: blue green green yellow blue red
   ""Lug"" results in ""blue,"" ""dax"" in ""green,"" ""zup"" goes back to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" changes to ""red."" ""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in another ""green.""

4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   Here ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" and leads to another ""yellow,"" ""lug"" gives ""blue,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug"" without changing the color, ""dax"" results in ""green,"" and the final ""lug"" returns to ""blue.""

5. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red."" ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" and results in another ""red.""

Based on the pattern, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word before it. If there is no word before it, it defaults to yellow in the given examples.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color associated with the preceding word. If there is no preceding word, default to yellow.",0.9,136,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let us look at the repeating patterns in each line of examples and their corresponding outputs:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the word immediately following ""walm"" is translated into ""green"" in the output, while ""walm"" itself is also translated to ""green.""
- If the word following ""walm"" appears twice before in that input (like ""dax"" in the second example), the second occurrence is still ""green"" followed by the color corresponding to that word (""blue"" in this case for ""dax"").
- When a word appears after ""walm"" for the first time, it is translated to ""green.""
- The words ""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" consistently have outputs of ""red,"" ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue,"" respectively, after the first instance of ""green"" caused by the presence of ""walm.""

These observations suggest that the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it triggers the word that follows it to be ""green,"" as well as itself being ""green,"" regardless of what the word normally translates to.

Rule: walm -> makes the following word and itself translate to ""green.""",1.0,136,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" instructs to repeat the color associated with the word just prior to ""walm"" three times. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and the occurrence of ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in ""green green green.""
- The second example also starts with ""dax,"" which we know corresponds to green, followed by ""walm,"" hence ""green green green"" again. 
- The third example shows ""wif"" corresponds to red, and when followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red."" The same pattern is observed with the word ""lug"" followed by ""walm,"" which corresponds to ""blue blue blue.""
- The fourth example consists only of ""lug"" followed by ""walm,"" resulting in ""blue blue blue,"" supporting the threefold repetition rule.
- The fifth example starts with ""wif"" (which is red), followed by ""walm,"" and the pattern of ""red red red"" is observed.

Therefore, the rule induced is that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,136,walm
"walm -> means to repeat the color of the previous word mentioned three times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is used after another word, it indicates that the color associated with that preceding word should be repeated three times consecutively in the output.

"walm -> repeat the color of the following word three times. Rule: When the word walm appears, it causes the color of the word that follows it to be repeated three times in the output sequence.",1.0,136,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns before and after the word and their corresponding outputs. By comparing the inputs and outputs, we can attempt to identify a consistent rule.

- Input: dax walm zup lug dax -> Output: green green green yellow blue green
- Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
- Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue
- Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow

Analyzing the patterns, it appears that every time the word ""walm"" is used, the output includes a sequence of three colors. The first of the three colors always matches the color associated with the word directly preceding ""walm"". For instance:

- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"".
- ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"".
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"".

Given this pattern, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

There is no evidence of ""dax"" generating a different output or being influenced by surrounding words. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green

This rule implies that whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color green in the output.",1.0,137,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" along with the possible meanings of other words in the examples.

In each example where ""dax"" is mentioned, the output is ""green"". Therefore, we can infer that ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green"".

dax -> green

The rule thus appears to be that the input ""dax"" maps to the output color ""green"", regardless of the other words present in the input.",1.0,137,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rules for the nonce word dax and the other words:

- Every time the input includes the word ""dax,"" the output is ""green."" 
- The word ""walm"" always corresponds to ""green,"" except when it follows the word ""lug,"" in which case it corresponds to ""blue.""
- The word ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow.""
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and so does ""bluf.""

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,137,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided. Here are the examples with their respective outputs:

Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
Input: wif lug dax walm -> Output: red blue green green green
Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
Input: wif -> Output: red

From the outputs, we can surmise that every time the word ""wif"" appears, the output includes at least one instance of the color ""red."" In cases where ""wif"" appears without any additional words, the output is solely ""red."" Therefore, it suggests that ""wif"" alone corresponds to the color ""red."" Furthermore, no other inputs without ""wif"" are provided to contradict this observation.

Based on this information, the most straightforward rule we can induce is:

Rule: wif -> red

This means that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""",1.0,137,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output. 

Therefore, the rule for the word ""wif"" is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,137,wif
"Based on the provided examples, ""wif"" seems to translate to the color ""red"". Regardless of what other words follow ""wif"", the output always begins with ""red"". Hence, one can deduce that:

wif -> red

"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of the context in which it appears.",1.0,137,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,137,wif
"Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.",1.0,137,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: Each instance of ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".",1.0,137,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" seems to consistently correspond to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.

Given this information, the rule can be written as:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,137,zup
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" appears to be that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Each instance of ""zup"" in the input correlates with ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the position in the sequence or the presence of other words.

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" can be defined as: zup -> yellow.",1.0,137,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" In each instance where 'zup' appears, the output includes the word ""yellow.""",1.0,137,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color following the word ""bluf."" To confirm this, let's look at each example:

1. wif zup dax bluf -> red yellow green green
2. wif zup bluf lug -> red yellow yellow blue
3. dax bluf wif zup wif -> green green red yellow red
4. lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> blue blue red blue blue yellow
5. dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red

In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by a color that is repeated (""green""), hence bluf could be green. 

In the second example, ""bluf"" again precedes the color ""yellow,"" which is repeated, so the rule seems consistent.

In the third example, ""bluf"" comes before ""red"" which is also the next repeated color in the sequence, confirming the pattern so far.

The fourth example presents ""bluf"" before a ""blue"" and again is followed by the color ""blue,"" further corroborating the rule.

In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""red,"" which becomes the next color in the sequence, consistent with the observations from previous examples.

Rule: bluf -> the color that is immediately repeated after it appears. For instance, if ""bluf"" is followed by ""red"" and the next color is also ""red,"" then bluf would mean ""red"" in that context.",1.0,137,bluf
"In order to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns and correlations between the inputs and outputs. Let's organize the information:

1. Input: wif zup dax bluf -> Output: red yellow green green
   - ""bluf"" correlates with ""green,"" but ""dax"" also correlates with ""green."" 

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue
   - ""bluf"" correlates with ""yellow"" here, not ""green.""

3. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif -> Output: green green red yellow red
   - ""bluf"" correlates with ""green"" again, suggesting ""bluf"" and ""dax"" might share a meaning or rule. 

4. Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow
   - ""bluf"" correlates with ""blue"" twice here, breaking the pattern of ""green"" and ""yellow.""

5. Input: dax lug wif bluf -> Output: green blue red red
   - ""bluf"" correlates with ""red"" this time, which diverges from previous patterns.

These outputs suggest that the color associated with ""bluf"" is not consistent and does not correspond to a single color. Instead, there is likely a rule based on context. 

Looking more closely, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word immediately preceding it:
- When ""dax"" (green) precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""green.""
- When ""zup"" (yellow) precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""
- When ""lug"" (blue) precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue.""
- When ""wif"" (red) precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,137,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns in the examples provided:

1. In the first example, ""wif zup dax bluf"" corresponds to ""red yellow green green."" Here, ""bluf"" is the fourth word and matches the fourth color ""green.""

2. In the second example, ""wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue."" Here, ""bluf"" is the third word and is associated with the third color ""yellow.""

3. In the third example, ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" corresponds to ""green green red yellow red."" Here, ""bluf"" is the second word and is associated with the second color, ""green.""

4. The fourth example, ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup,"" matches ""blue blue red blue blue yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" appears twice, as the second and fifth words, correlating with ""blue"" both times.

5. Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax lug wif bluf,"" translates to ""green blue red red."" The word ""bluf"" is in the fourth position, which corresponds to the fourth color, ""red.""

Considering these examples, the rule that can be deduced for ""bluf"" seems to be that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color associated with its position in the input sequence. If we take the positions of ""bluf"" in the sequences and the corresponding color outputs, we can infer the following pattern:

- Position 2 corresponds to ""blue""
- Position 3 corresponds to ""yellow""
- Position 4 corresponds to ""red""
- Position 5 corresponds to ""green""

Given this pattern, ""bluf"" can be thought of as a variable tied to its position in the sequence, representing a different color based on the following rule:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on its position in the list of words, such that:

- If ""bluf"" is in the 2nd position, it means ""blue.""
- If ""bluf"" is in the 3rd position, it means ""yellow.""
- If ""bluf"" is in the 4th position, it means ""red.""
- If ""bluf"" is in the 5th position, it means ""green.""

So the rule is:

bluf -> meaning based on position (2nd: blue, 3rd: yellow, 4th: red, 5th: green).",1.0,137,bluf
Rule: bluf means 'repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it'.,1.0,137,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,0.0,137,bluf
"To induce the rule, let's examine the outputs associated with the use of ""walm"" in various contexts:

1. When ""walm"" is used after ""wif"": the output is three instances of the color associated with the previous word, which is ""red"" in this context.
2. When ""walm"" is used after ""lug"": the output is three instances of the color associated with ""lug"", which is ""blue"".
3. When ""walm"" is used after ""dax"": the output is three instances of the color associated with ""dax"", which is ""green"".
4. When ""walm"" is used after a sequence of words (""wif lug dax walm""): the output repeats the last color three times, which in this case is ""green"".
5. When ""walm"" is used before a word (""wif walm zup""): the output is three instances of the color preceding ""walm"" followed by the color associated with the word after ""walm"".

From the observed patterns, ""walm"" seems to cause the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word triple times, regardless of its position relative to the other words:

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times.",1.0,137,walm
"Based on the given examples, walm seems to correspond to a repetition of the color that precedes its mention. Here is the breakdown of the examples given:

1. Input: ""zup wif walm"" 
   Output: ""yellow red red red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" produces three additional ""red""

2. Input: ""wif lug walm""
   Output: ""red blue blue blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" produces three additional ""blue""

3. Input: ""dax walm wif""
   Output: ""green green green red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" produces three additional ""green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

4. Input: ""wif lug dax walm""
   Output: ""red blue green green green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" produces three additional ""green"" (taking the color from ""dax,"" which comes right before it)

5. Input: ""wif walm zup""
   Output: ""red red red yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" produces three additional ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

walm -> Repeats the color word directly before it three times.

Rule: If X is a color, and the sequence is ""X walm"", the output will be ""X X X X"".",1.0,137,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the way it affects the outputs. 

1. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red"".
2. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue"".
3. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green"".
4. When ""walm"" is the last word in the input, the color corresponding to the first word before ""walm"" is repeated three times.
5. When ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" the output is ""red red red yellow,"" suggesting that the rule tied to ""walm"" has been applied first, then followed by the output corresponding to ""zup.""

Based on these observations, it appears that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it three times.

Rule: walm -> Causes the output to repeat the colour corresponding to the previous word three times.",1.0,137,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" means to repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately follows it three times.

Explanation: In the examples, we see that whenever ""walm"" is followed by a word, the color corresponding to that word is repeated three times in the output.

- In the first example, ""zup"" means yellow. ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, and the output is ""yellow red red red.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue. ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" and the output is ""red blue blue blue.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to green. ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green green red.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""dax"" corresponds to green. ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" and the output is ""red blue green green green.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red red yellow.""

Therefore, the pattern that emerges is that ""walm"" causes the color of the word that follows to be repeated three times.

walm -> Repeat the color of the following word three times.",0.8,137,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by looking for patterns between the input and output pairs.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- ""walm"" is followed by three ""red.""

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
- ""walm"" is followed by three ""blue.""

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- ""walm"" is preceded by three ""green.""

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow
- ""walm"" is followed by ""red"" produced by ""wif"" and followed by ""yellow"" produced by ""zup.""

Analyzing the patterns, it seems that when ""walm"" is present in the input, the output contains a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it, repeated three times.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times in the output sequence. If another nonce word follows ""walm,"" proceed with its corresponding color after the repetition.

"Based on the information provided by the examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm"" by examining the Input and corresponding Output sequences.

1. When ""wif walm dax"" is the input, the output is ""red red red green"". The words ""wif"" and ""dax"" are both translated to ""red"" and ""green"", respectively. Only ""walm"" is left, paired with an extra ""red"".

2. For the input ""lug zup dax walm"", the output is ""blue yellow green green green"". Here, ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""green"". ""Walm"" translates into two additional ""green"".

3. ""dax walm"" as input gives ""green green green"" as output. ""Dax"" once again corresponds to ""green"", and ""walm"" appears to add two more ""green"".

4. The input ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow"". The words ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"" are translated to ""red,"" ""green,"" and ""yellow"", respectively. And ""walm"" again seems to add an extra ""red"" because the sequence starts with ""wif.""

5. Finally, for ""wif walm zup walm"", the output is ""red red red yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""walm"" following ""wif"" adds two ""red"", and following ""zup"" adds two ""yellow"".

Based on these examples, it seems that ""walm"" is a rule that duplicates the color associated with the word that directly precedes it, meaning ""walm"" causes the color of the word before it to be repeated two additional times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word two more times.",1.0,138,walm
"Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" translates to multiple outputs of the color green, specifically, the number of greens seems to be directly proportional to the position of ""walm"" in the input string. Each instance of ""walm"" increases the count by one.

For example:

In ""lug zup dax walm,"" ""walm"" is the fourth word, so there are three greens in the output.
In ""dax walm,"" ""walm"" is the second word, so there are two greens in the output.
In ""wif walm dax zup,"" ""walm"" is the second word, so there are two greens followed by other colors according to other words.
In ""wif walm zup walm,"" the first ""walm"" is the second word resulting in two greens, and the second ""walm"" is the fourth word, which adds two more greens, making a total of four greens from both ""walm"" instances.

Therefore, the rule seems to be: Each occurrence of ""walm"" results in an output of ""green"" repeated one less than the position of ""walm"" in the input list.

- The word ""wif"" does not depend on the position in the input string for its corresponding output to be ""red.""
- Other words in the input, such as ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax,"" seems to correspond to other specific colors consistently, independent of the presence of ""wif.""

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color output in each instance. Here is what we can deduce from the given examples:

1. ""lug walm zup wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue yellow red."" Here, ""lug,"" ""walm,"" and ""zup"" each output ""blue,"" and ""wif"" outputs ""red.""

2. When ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red,"" as seen in the second example.

3. ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" outputs ""yellow red red yellow blue."" Here, ""zup"" outputs ""yellow,"" ""wif"" outputs ""red,"" and ""lug"" outputs ""blue.""

4. ""dax walm wif"" outputs ""green green green red."" In this case, both ""dax"" and ""walm"" output ""green,"" and ""wif"" outputs ""red.""

"Analyzing the examples provided:

- Example 1: ""dax lug walm zup wif"" outputs ""green blue blue blue yellow red.""

- Example 2: ""lug zup walm lug"" outputs ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue.""

- Example 4: ""zup lug walm wif walm"" outputs ""yellow blue blue blue red red red.""
  ""zup"", ""lug"", and ""wif"" produce ""yellow"", ""blue"", and ""red"", respectively. Following the first ""walm"", the color ""blue"" repeats twice more. Then ""wif"" is replicated twice after the second ""walm"".

- Example 5: ""dax walm wif walm zup"" outputs ""green green green red red red yellow.""
  Similar pattern follows where ""dax"" is green and shows two more ""green"" after ""walm"". Then ""wif"" is red with an additional two ""red"" after the second ""walm"". ""zup"" produces ""yellow"" at the end with no repetition.

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the colors to repeat in the sequence of the last color mentioned before ""walm."" Thus, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it replicates the preceding color name until a new color name appears in the input sequence or the sequence ends.

Rule: walm -> repeat the last mentioned color until a new color is named or the sequence ends.

Examples illustrating the rule:
- In ""dax lug walm zup wif,"" ""lug"" is blue, and after ""walm,"" the color blue is repeated once before a new color ""zup"" (yellow) appears.
- In ""lug zup walm lug,"" ""zup"" is yellow, and after ""walm,"" the color yellow is repeated twice before a new color ""lug"" (blue) appears.
- In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" is green, and after ""walm,"" the color green is repeated twice more, with no new color interrupting the sequence.
- In ""zup lug walm wif walm,"" ""lug"" is blue, and after the first ""walm,"" blue is repeated once before a new color ""wif"" (red) appears. Then ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and red is repeated twice.
- In ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" ""dax"" is green, and after the first ""walm,"" green is repeated twice more before a new color ""wif"" (red) appears. Then ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and red is repeated twice, before the next color ""zup"" (yellow) appears.",1.0,139,walm

Input: zup lug walm wif walm

Considering the inputs and outputs, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" has the following rule associated with it:

For instance, if ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output will be blue repeated until the color sequence dictated by the following word begins. If ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output will be multiple greens until the next word's color comes up, and so on.

Looking at the inputs and corresponding outputs:

- ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red"".
- Every instance of ""wif"" in the examples translates to ""red"".

Thus, the rule seems straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,140,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can see a pattern of color names associated with the words ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" and ""wif."" The other words correspond to specific colors as follows:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> blue (same as lug)

The word ""wif"" also correlates with a specific color when used in different combinations:

- lug wif -> blue red
- lug wif lug dax bluf -> blue red blue green green
- zup lug bluf zup bluf wif -> yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
- wif lug bluf wif zup -> red blue blue red yellow
- dax lug wif -> green blue red

From these examples, it is clear that ""wif"" always translates to the color red, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,140,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the input and output pairs to identify patterns that associate the nonce word ""wif"" with a particular output:

1. ""lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue red""
2. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red blue green green""
3. ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red""
4. ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" corresponds to ""red blue blue red yellow""
5. ""dax lug wif"" corresponds to ""green blue red""

Looking at the outputs corresponding to ""wif"", we see that ""wif"" alone corresponds to ""red"" when there are no other nonce words before it (Example 1 and 2 when looking at just ""wif"" and not the entire strings). In examples where ""wif"" follows other nonce words, the color ""red"" is still consistently the output. In examples 3 and 4, ""wif"" results in ""red"" subsequent to other colors, unaffected by the context. Therefore, we can induce that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,140,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. Observing the pairs, it becomes apparent that:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" (notice it's repeated in the second example, consistent with ""lug"")
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

The word ""wif"" appears in different positions relative to the other words, and in each instance, the output color ""red"" is associated with it. Therefore, it does not depend on the position of ""wif"" within the sequence. Given these consistent pairings across the examples, we can conclude that ""wif"" directly translates to the color ""red.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the input and output pairs and look for patterns:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output is ""green"".
2. Whenever ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output is ""red"".
3. Whenever ""zup"" appears, the corresponding output is ""yellow"".
4. Whenever ""lug"" appears, the corresponding output is ""blue"".
5. ""bluf"" does not correspond to a consistent color output, but is always followed by or precedes another color in the sequence.

Now, let's look at the contexts in which ""bluf"" appears:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by two yellows, despite different words preceding it. 
- In the second and fifth examples, ""bluf"" is followed by two reds in the second and two blues in the fifth.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by a yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by a red and precedes a green.

These observations suggest that ""bluf"" causes the color that follows or precedes it to be repeated once. It may be analogous to a command to duplicate the subsequent or preceding color in the sequence.

Considering this, let's phrase the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" duplicates the color that immediately follows or precedes it in the output sequence.

Therefore:

bluf -> repeat the color that comes after or before.",1.0,140,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" appears to be a nonce word used to represent a specific pattern in the output. By examining the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can induce the following rule:

Rule:
- Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the duplication of the color that represents the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" in the output sequence.

Let's test and apply this rule to the given examples:

1. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow
   Rule Application: The word preceding ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, therefore ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" twice.

2. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   Rule Application: The word preceding ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, hence ""bluf"" results in ""red"" twice.

3. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow
   Rule Application: The word preceding ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" twice.

4. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
   Output: blue green green red green
   Rule Application: The word preceding ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" which is represented by green, thus ""bluf"" yields ""green"" twice.

5. Input: wif lug bluf
   Output: red blue blue
   Rule Application: The word before ""bluf"" is ""lug,"" represented by blue, therefore ""bluf"" generates ""blue"" twice.

Based on the rule induced from the examples, bluf corresponds to repeating the color that the immediately previous word represents.

bluf -> meaning: The repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf"".",1.0,140,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we'll analyze the patterns between inputs and their corresponding outputs. It appears that individual words in the input are associated with specific colors in the output.

Let's identify patterns for known words first:

- ""dax"" consistently results in ""green.""
- ""wif"" consistently results in ""red.""
- ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue.""
- ""zup"" consistently results in ""yellow"" when it is at the end of the sequence.
- ""walm"" results in ""blue,"" similar to ""lug,"" suggesting it might share the same color output or the sequence ""lug walm"" triggers the ""blue"" output twice.

Now, let's focus on ""bluf"":

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and results in a doubling of the color associated with ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" is at the end and results in the previous color (""blue,"" corresponding to ""wif"") being repeated twice.
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in a repeat of the color associated with ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" produces a repeat of the previously stated color ""green"" from ""dax.""
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" resulting in the color ""blue"" associated with ""lug"" being repeated.

From these observations, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,140,bluf
"Analyzing the input and output pairs provided, there's a pattern between the words before ""bluf"" and the colors that follow. Each nonce word corresponds to a specific color:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow

""Bluf"" seems to take the color of the word immediately preceding it and repeats that color, followed by red if ""wif"" precedes it, or green if ""dax"" precedes it, or blue if ""lug"" is in front of it. There is no example provided for the case of ""zup"" preceding ""bluf"". 

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word and then follows a specific pattern:
- If ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", then the color is red.
- If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", then the color is green.
- If ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"", then the color is blue.
- The pattern for ""zup"" preceding ""bluf"" is not provided in the examples.

bluf -> The color of the preceding word following a defined pattern based on that word (red if followed by ""wif"", green if followed by ""dax"", blue if followed by ""lug"").",0.9,140,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that comes after the unique color in the series. If there's a repeated sequence of colors, ""bluf"" takes the color that follows the unique one. If the unique color is last in the sequence, ""bluf"" repeats that color.

Examples:
- In ""dax wif dax zup bluf,"" ""wif"" is the unique color (red), and ""zup"" follows it, which is yellow, hence ""bluf"" is yellow, too.
- In ""lug walm wif bluf,"" ""wif"" is unique and is red. ""Bluf"" repeats this red.
- In ""dax bluf zup,"" ""dax"" is the only color before ""bluf,"" so ""bluf"" repeats the color green.
- In ""lug dax bluf wif dax,"" ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" and ""dax"" which are unique in the series and is followed by red, so ""bluf"" becomes red.
- In ""wif lug bluf,"" ""wif"" is unique, and ""lug"" comes after it, which is blue, so ""bluf"" is also blue.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" does not correspond to a consistent color like the other words, which seem to maintain a one-to-one relationship with a specific color (e.g., dax -> green, lug -> blue).

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" can be deduced as:

zup -> always translates to the color yellow.

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""zup"" consistently yields ""yellow"" in the output. Here are the specific examples to illustrate this:

- In ""zup bluf dax,"" ""zup"" corresponds to the first ""yellow"" in the output.
- In ""zup lug,"" ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In ""zup dax lug,"" ""zup"" is the first word and corresponds to the first ""yellow"" in the output.
- In ""dax lug zup,"" ""zup"" is the last word and corresponds to the last ""yellow"" in the output.
- In ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" ""zup"" appears twice and both instances correspond to ""yellow"" in the output.

"From the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" directly translates to the color red.

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red""
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green""

Moreover, regardless of the following words, the repetition of colors correlates with the presence of ""walm"" after a specific word. To list the pattern clearly:

- ""wif"" output is ""red,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" it's ""red"" repeated three times.
- ""dax"" output is ""green,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" it's ""green"" repeated three times.
- ""lug"" is not independently shown in the examples, but ""lug walm"" results in ""blue"" repeated three times, so we could infer that ""lug"" might output ""blue.""

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output to have three consecutive colors that match the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""walm."" Here's how the rule works with each example:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" since ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"" since ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" since ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

The association is consistent throughout the examples. Therefore, the rule for walm seems to be that it repeats the color output of the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,141,walm
"To decode the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns of the words and their corresponding outputs in each example.

- In the first example, ""wif lug walm"" translates to ""red blue blue blue."" The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" The term ""walm"" then appears to be responsible for the three repetitions of ""blue.""

- In the second example, ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" So again, it seems like ""walm"" is responsible for the repetition of ""red.""

- In the third example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the triple repetition can be attributed to ""walm.""

- In the fourth example, ""zup dax walm zup wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green yellow red."" ""Zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and then ""walm"" results in the repetition of ""green."" 

- In the fifth example, ""dax walm wif zup"" translates to ""green green green red yellow."" Once again, ""dax"" is ""green,"" then ""walm"" produces the repetition, followed by ""wif"" which is ""red,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color word preceding it to be repeated three times. If ""walm"" appears after a color word, it repeats the color output of that word three times.

- ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue""
- ""zup"" on its own translates to ""yellow""

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the output is ""green green"" because ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and ""bluf"" repeats that color twice.

2. In the second input ""dax walm wif,"" ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and ""wif"" with ""red."" Since the sequence ""dax walm"" results in ""green green,"" it again suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"" which is ""green.""

4. In the fourth input ""dax walm zup lug,"" the sequence ""dax walm"" transforms into ""green green,"" consistent with ""walm"" repeating the color of ""dax.""

5. In the fifth input ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" the sequence ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue,"" upholding the rule that ""walm"" repeats ""lug's"" color.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be to repeat the color of the word that directly precedes it.

Rule: walm repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,142,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at each instance where the word appears and analyze the patterns in the corresponding outputs.

1. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
Here, ""walm"" is between ""zup"" and ""lug,"" and the colors corresponding to ""zup walm lug"" are ""yellow yellow blue"".

2. dax walm wif -> green green green red
""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif,"" with the corresponding colors being ""green green red"".

3. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> red red green green red red red blue red
In this sequence, ""walm"" is between the last ""wif"" and ""lug,"" and the colors are ""red blue"".

4. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue
Here, ""walm"" is after ""dax"" and before ""zup,"" with the colors ""green yellow blue"".

5. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
In this last example, ""walm"" is between ""lug"" and ""wif,"" and the output colors are ""blue blue red"".

From these examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it takes the color of the word before it and repeats that color until the next word comes. So, the output color sequence maintains the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" until a new word is presented.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word until a new word is presented.",1.0,142,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the color word that follows it to be repeated until a new color word appears. Here are the rules deduced from the examples:

1. In the first example, ""lug zup walm lug,"" ""zup"" is converted to ""yellow"" and it repeats after ""walm"" until ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" appears again.

2. In the second example, ""dax walm wif,"" ""dax"" is converted to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" ""green"" repeats until ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" appears, replacing the repetition of ""green.""

3. In the third example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif,"" the colors remain the same until ""walm,"" after which ""red"" (from the previous ""wif"") repeats until ""lug"" (which is ""blue"") appears and is followed by another ""wif"" (which is ""red"").

Rule: walm -> causes the color represented by the word immediately preceding it to repeat until a new color word appears.",1.0,142,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the given examples:

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""yellow"" as well, since it precedes ""lug,"" which we already established to mean ""blue.""

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Since ""walm"" occurs between two ""green,"" it's consistent with the prior example that ""walm"" could mean ""green.""

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

In this example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" likely to ""green"" (considering two adjacent ""bluf"" lead to two adjacent ""green"" in the output). ""Walm"" comes before ""lug"" (""blue"") and follows ""red,"" suggesting it should be ""red"" to maintain the established pattern of repetition before color change.

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue

We see ""dax"" being ""green"" again, followed by ""walm,"" which results in ""green"" again, consistent with the pattern that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word before it. 

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Here, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""walm"" follows it and is also ""blue,"" and then ""wif"" is ""red."" 

By analyzing these examples, we can almost infer that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word immediately before it, replicating its color in the output. However, the third input/output pair poses a slight problem because there, ""walm"" would need to be ""red"" instead of ""green"" for the pattern to hold true. 

To make the exception for the third input where ""walm"" followed multiple ""red"" and still turned ""red,"" it could be that ""walm"" repeats the most recent sequence of colors when adjacent to the same color. When ""walm"" follows a series of different colors, it simply repeats the color that came immediately before it.

Rule: `walm` means to repeat the immediate prior color unless it follows a series of a unique color, in which case it repeats the sequence.",0.8,142,walm
"To deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns and their corresponding color outputs.

1. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output sequence is a repeat of the color blue: ""lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue.""  
2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is repeated green: ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red.""
3. In a sequence where ""walm"" is preceded by various words and followed by ""lug,"" which is then followed by other words, only ""walm lug wif"" correlates with ""red blue red"" while the rest of the sequence before and after consists of single colors for each word: ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" -> ""red red green green red red red blue red.""
4. Again, when ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is followed by ""zup lug,"" there's a repeat of the color green before changing with ""zup"" and ""lug"": ""dax walm zup lug"" -> ""green green green yellow blue.""
5. When ""walm"" is between ""lug"" and ""wif"" with a repeating pattern, the color for ""lug"" repeats for ""walm"" and starts a new repetition for ""wif"": ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue blue.""

From these examples, we can see a pattern. The word ""walm"" seems to induce a repetition of the last color mentioned before it until a new color word appears. This repetition continues through ""walm"" and stops when a new color word is used or the sequence ends.

"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""dax"" seems to be associated with a specific color. We can understand the meaning of ""dax"" by comparing the inputs to their corresponding outputs.

From the first example:
- Input: wif dax wif
- Output: red green red

This suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

From the second example:
- Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
- Output: blue red blue green green

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""dax"" still appears to correspond to ""green"". ""bluf"" may correspond to ""green"" as well, given the double ""green"" at the end of the output.

From the third example:
- Input: zup lug dax lug
- Output: yellow blue green blue

""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and the pattern of ""lug"" and ""dax"" still holds with ""blue"" and ""green"", respectively.

From the fourth example:
- Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
- Output: red red blue green red

""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"". The sequence of ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""green"" respectively, suggesting that ""bluf"" and ""wif"" may share the same color output, ""red,"" and that ""dax"" is still associated with ""green"".

From the fifth example:
- Input: zup bluf lug dax lug
- Output: yellow yellow blue green blue

This also suggests that ""zup"" and ""bluf"" may produce the same color, which is ""yellow"". ""lug"" and ""dax"" continue to correspond to ""blue"" and ""green"", respectively.

Considering all examples, it is consistently observed that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". This observation is supported regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,143,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rules concerning the word ""dax"":

1. When we see ""wif"" in the input, it corresponds to ""red"" in the output;
2. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"";
3. ""bluf"" returns either ""green"" or ""red"" in the output, depending on its position relative to ""dax"";
4. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

The challenge is to determine what ""dax"" corresponds to in the output. Let's analyze the pattern for ""dax"":

- In ""wif dax wif"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- In ""lug wif lug dax bluf"", ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green"".
- In ""zup lug dax lug"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- In ""wif bluf lug dax wif"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- In ""zup bluf lug dax lug"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Regardless of the other words' positions, ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green"" in the output. However, we also observe that the color ""green"" is not only associated with ""dax"" but also with ""bluf"" in some cases. It's important to note that in every case where ""green"" is output without a ""dax"" present, ""bluf"" is the final word in the sequence. Since there is no example where ""bluf"" appears without another color following it unless ""dax"" also appears, it could signify that ""bluf"" means ""repeat the previous color"" with the exception that when followed by ""dax"" it instead means ""green"".

Regarding ""dax"", in every instance, regardless of its position or the surrounding words, the output is consistently ""green"". Therefore, we establish that:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" signifies the color ""green"".",1.0,143,dax
"Based on the examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" corresponds to a specific color in the outputs. To determine the rule for ""dax,"" we need to look at the pattern and see where ""dax"" occurs and what color is output.

In the first example, ""dax"" appears between ""wif"" and ""wif,"" and ""green"" is the color between ""red"" and ""red"" in the output.

In the second example, ""dax"" is the last word and is followed by ""bluf"" in the previous word; the corresponding color is ""green"" followed by ""green.""

In the third example, ""dax"" is between ""lug"" in both instances, and ""green"" is between ""blue"" in the output.

In the fourth example, ""dax"" again appears between ""lug"" and ""wif,"" resulting in ""green"" between ""blue"" and ""red.""

In the fifth example, ""dax"" is between ""lug"" instances, and ""green"" is between ""blue"" in the output.

From these patterns, regardless of the other words, whenever ""dax"" is mentioned, the output is ""green."" Therefore, we can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,143,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" is replaced with the word ""green"". In all instances, whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" is present in the corresponding output. However, there is another rule at play determining the meaning of other words.

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" appears to result in ""green"".
- The third example supports the rule that ""lug"" is ""blue"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" now results in ""red"" rather than ""green"", indicating that ""bluf"" does not consistently correspond to a single color, but it might be affected by its position or surrounding words.
- The fifth example further supports that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and that ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"", leading to the conclusion that ""bluf"" must be context-dependent.

Considering these observations, let's re-evaluate the consistent rule:

- ""dax"" always results in ""green"".

Now, taking a closer look at the variable colors associated with ""wif"", ""bluf"", ""zup"", and ""lug"":

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" (Examples 1 and 4).
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" (Examples 2, 3, 4, and 5).
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" (Examples 3 and 5).

It's likely that ""bluf"" is context-dependent, as in Example 2 it resulted in ""green"" when following ""dax"", but in Example 4 it resulted in ""red"" when it is at the second position in the sequence. In Example 5, it also resulted in ""yellow"" when in the second position. This might suggest that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word following it; however, this is not confirmed as we do not have an example where ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" for ""blue"".

Considering these observations:

Rule: ""dax"" -> ""green"". Other words also correspond to specific colors, but ""bluf"" might take the color of the following word unless it precedes ""dax"", where it might be overridden by a rule concerning ""dax"".",1.0,143,dax
"Analyzing the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to a specific color output. To determine the rule for what ""dax"" means, the context around ""dax"" in each input will be examined in relation to the output. 

1. In the first example, the word before and after ""dax"" is the same (""wif""), and the output colors before and after ""green"" are also the same (""red""). 

2. In the second example, ""dax"" follows a unique pattern ""lug dax bluf"" which translates to ""blue green green"". Notice that ""dax"" comes after ""lug"" and before ""bluf"", but the position within the pattern doesn't seem to affect the output for ""dax"", as it is ""green"", just like in the first example.

3. In the third example, ""lug dax lug"", ""dax"" is in between the same word ""lug"" and the output is ""blue green blue"". Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" comes after different words (""lug"" and ""bluf"") and yields ""green"" in the output, while the other words correspond to their respective colors regardless of their position relative to ""dax"".

5. In the fifth example, the pattern is slightly different than the fourth, with ""zup"" instead of ""wif,"" but ""dax"" still translates to ""green"".

With all the examples considered, it appears that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"", irrespective of the surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,143,dax
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of the context or position in the sequence.",1.0,143,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" every time it is used. Each other word corresponds to a different color, but ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" Thus, the rule can be defined as:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" means red.",1.0,143,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe that every time the word ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" is included in the output. There is a one-to-one correspondence regardless of the position of ""wif"" within the input sequence or the words that surround it. Therefore, we can induce that the word ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red"".

Hence, the rule here is:

wif -> red.",1.0,143,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each unique word is associated with a color, and ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". Therefore, the rule appears to be:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" represents the color ""red"".",1.0,143,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" let's look at each example:

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red red,"" and ""wif"" appears between them with no direct output associated with it.

2. Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
   Output: blue red red blue red
   
   Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""red red."" There are two instances of ""wif,"" suggesting that it's appended with ""red"" each time.

3. Input: wif
   Output: red
   
   This example shows that ""wif"" alone corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
   
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" followed by ""wif"" which again corresponds to ""red.""

5. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
   Output: red yellow yellow red green
   
   Here ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" both times, ""zup"" to ""yellow yellow,"" and ""bluf"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

From these examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red"" irrespective of its position in the input string. There might be additional patterns for other words, such as how ""zup"" and ""bluf"" translate to different amounts of ""yellow"" and ""red"" respectively, but for ""wif"" the rule seems consistent.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,143,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" irrespective of the context it is used in.",1.0,143,zup
"Observing the provided inputs and their respective outputs, we can attempt to discern a pattern for the nonce word ""zup.""

From the first input/output combination:
- Input: zup wif
- Output: yellow red
We can see that ""zup"" precedes ""wif"" and the output is ""yellow"" followed by ""red.""

From the second input/output combination:
- Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
- Output: yellow blue red green green red
""zup"" precedes ""lug"" which corresponds to the output ""yellow blue"" and is followed by a series of color pairs that match the input pairs.

From the third input/output combination:
- Input: lug zup
- Output: blue yellow
""zup"" follows ""lug"" and the output accordingly is ""blue yellow,"" indicating once more that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

From the fourth and fifth input/output combinations:
- Input: zup walm
- Output: yellow yellow yellow
- Input: zup walm dax
- Output: yellow yellow yellow green
We see that ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"" which results in three ""yellow"" in the output and then ""dax"" follows giving ""green.""

Based on these examples, it seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the context or position it has relative to other words in the input.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"".",1.0,143,zup
"Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow.",1.0,143,zup
"Rule: ""zup"" -> ""yellow"" 

Each instance of the word ""zup"" in the inputs corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs.",1.0,143,zup
"From the examples provided, we can analyze the occurrences of ""zup"" and its correlation to the output to decipher its meaning.

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Here, ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
Output: yellow blue red green green red

In this sequence, we can correlate ""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""bluf"" repeats ""green"". 

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow

Following the pattern we've seen so far, ""lug"" results in ""blue"" and ""zup"" results in ""yellow"".

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""walm"" doesn't change the output color. It seems to repeat the previous color, which is ""yellow"" provided by ""zup"".

Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green

Following the established pattern, ""zup"" yields ""yellow"", ""walm"" repeats the previous color ""yellow"", and ""dax"" gives ""green"".

Rule: zup -> yellow

""Zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" across all examples.",1.0,143,zup
"From the examples provided:

- ""lug bluf wif"" translates to ""blue blue red""
- ""wif bluf lug"" translates to ""red red blue""
- ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" translates to ""green green red blue yellow""
- ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue red green green red""
- ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red""

We can see the following patterns:

- ""lug"" appears to consistently translate to ""blue""
- ""wif"" appears to consistently translate to ""red""
- ""dax"" appears to consistently translate to ""green""
- ""zup"" appears to consistently translate to ""yellow""

With this understanding, we notice that ""bluf"" causes the word right before it to be repeated in the translation. It does not have a specific color associated with it; instead, it repeats the color word preceding it. There isn't a direct translation for ""bluf"" as a color. Instead, its function is to double the color that comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. When ""bluf"" appears after a color word, the translation output of that color word is repeated.",1.0,143,bluf
"Rule: ""bluf"" matches the color of the word following it. If ""bluf"" is at the end of a sequence, it matches the color of the word preceding it.",1.0,143,bluf
"Based on the given examples, ""bluf"" seems to correspond to a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here's the rule I deduced:

- When ""bluf"" follows a word that has been assigned a color, it outputs the color for that word twice.
- The mapping of the words to colors from the examples seem to be:
    wif -> red,
    lug -> blue,
    dax -> green, and
    zup -> yellow.

Therefore, ""bluf"" -> repeats the color of the previous word.

Rule: If ""X bluf"" is the input where X is a word with an assigned color, then the output is ""color of X color of X"".",1.0,143,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" modifies the preceding color word to repeat the same color, and then when ""bluf"" is followed by another color, it translates to the color ""red"" unless ""bluf"" is the last word in the sequence, in which case it translates to ""red"". 

Here's the breakdown of the patterns observed:
- When ""bluf"" follows a color (like ""lug"" or ""wif""), that color is repeated once before we see the effect of ""bluf"". 
- After the repeated color, if ""bluf"" is followed by a color, that next color is translated to ""red"".
- If ""bluf"" is not followed by a color, its own translation is ""red"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be the following:
Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a color, it causes that color to be repeated, and then transforms the following word into ""red"" unless it is at the end of the sequence, in which case ""bluf"" itself translates to ""red"".",0.8,143,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to mean ""green."" In each example, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output:

Input: lug bluf wif -> Output: blue green red
Input: wif bluf lug -> Output: red green blue
Input: dax bluf wif lug zup -> Output: green green red blue yellow
Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> Output: yellow blue red green green red
Input: lug wif bluf -> Output: blue red green

However, in the fourth input ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output, which is repeated twice in sequence (""green green""), indicating that it could be a translation error or a different pattern that hasn't been made clear by the example. Assuming it's not a translation error and adhering to the rest of the examples, the rule can be:

Rule: bluf -> green.",0.0,143,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can look at the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs, focusing particularly on the patterns that emerge around the use of ""walm.""

Here's what we know from the examples:

1. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   Analysis: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and ""dax"" translates to ""green"". The triple ""yellow"" suggests a repeated quality or emphasis that the word ""walm"" might be causing. ""Walm"" appears before ""dax,"" but ""dax"" does not repeat; only ""yellow"" does.

2. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   Analysis: ""wif"" translates to ""red"", ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and ""dax"" translates to ""green"". The triples indicate that ""walm"" is again causing the following word to be repeated.

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Analysis: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" translates to ""red"". Here we again see that ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated thrice.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: The absence of another color word after ""walm"" shows that it simply repeats ""yellow"" thrice.

5. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""dax"" and ""zup"" retain their translations from earlier examples. ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in it being repeated twice more. Another ""walm"" after ""lug"" causes the translation of ""lug"" (which is ""blue"") to be repeated twice more as well.

From these examples, we can conclude that ""walm"" is a repeat function for the color word that follows it. In cases where ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, it repeats the color word that precedes it three times in total. If ""walm"" is followed by another color word, it causes that word to be repeated twice more, resulting in three consecutive outputs of that color.

Rule: walm -> repeats the next color word in the sequence three times. If ""walm"" is the last word, it repeats the preceding color word three times total. If there is no next color word, the last color word before ""walm"" is assumed to be repeated twice after its first occurrence.",1.0,143,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word just before it multiple times. To decipher the exact rule, let's consider each example:

1. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   Here, ""walm"" repeats the color ""yellow"" (associated with ""zup"") three times before the next word ""dax.""

2. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   Here, ""walm"" repeats the color ""green"" (associated with ""dax"") three times after it.

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Again, ""walm"" repeats the color ""red"" (associated with ""wif"") three times after it.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Here, ""walm"" repeats the color ""yellow"" (associated with ""zup"") three times without a subsequent word.

5. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   In this example, ""walm"" first repeats the color ""green"" (associated with ""dax"") three times before another word ""zup,"" after which it repeats the color ""blue"" (associated with ""lug"") three times, following ""lug.""

Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.",1.0,143,walm
"Inspecting the relationship between the input ""walm"" and the corresponding output pattern, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes duplication of the color that is associated with the word immediately preceding it. In every case, the color that comes before ""walm"" is repeated a number of times after ""walm"" appears. The number of repetitions appears to be one less than the number of letters in the word that comes before ""walm"". Here is the breakdown of each example:

1. Input: zup walm dax
   - zup -> yellow
   - walm causes the preceding color (yellow) to appear three times (since ""zup"" has three letters), followed by the next color.
   - dax -> green
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green

2. Input: wif lug dax walm
   - wif -> red
   - lug -> blue
   - dax -> green
   - walm causes the preceding color (green) to repeat three times (as ""dax"" has three letters).
   Output: red blue green green green

3. Input: zup wif walm
   - zup -> yellow
   - wif -> red
   - walm causes the preceding color (red) to repeat three times (as ""wif"" has three letters).
   Output: yellow red red red

4. Input: zup walm
   - zup -> yellow
   - walm causes the preceding color (yellow) to repeat three times (as ""zup"" has three letters).
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   - dax -> green
   - walm causes the preceding color (green) to repeat three times (as ""dax"" has three letters).
   - zup -> yellow
   - lug -> blue
   - walm causes the preceding color (blue) to repeat three times (since ""lug"" has three letters).
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

Based on this, we can articulate the rule for ""walm"": 

Rule: walm causes the color of the word that precedes it to repeat a number of times equal to the number of letters in the preceding word minus one. 

So, walm -> causes repetition of the preceding color based on the number of letters in the preceding word minus one.",1.0,143,walm
"To determine the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's examine the relationship between the input and the output.

1. In the first example, ""zup walm dax"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow green,"" which suggests that ""walm"" might translate to repeating the color associated with the preceding word, as ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times. ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" which appears once at the end.

2. In the second example, ""wif lug dax walm"" converts to ""red blue green green green,"" which supports the previous guess as ""walm"" seems to be repeating the color associated with ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" three times.

3. In the third example, ""zup wif walm"" becomes ""yellow red red red,"" again suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word, as ""wif"" is associated with ""red"" and ""red"" is repeated three times.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which is consistent with the guess, as ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

5. Finally, in the fifth example ""dax walm zup lug walm,"" the output is ""green green green yellow blue blue blue."" It shows ""walm"" repeating the color of ""dax"" (""green"") three times, and later ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" (""blue"") three times.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times in the output.

Therefore:
walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",0.9,143,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns in the examples provided.

Looking at the outputs, we notice that there's a repetition of a color corresponding to the position of ""walm"" in the input.

1. ""zup walm dax"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow green."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" The word ""walm"" is between ""zup"" and ""dax,"" and we can see that it generates ""yellow yellow,"" repeating the color for the preceding word.

2. ""wif lug dax walm"" outputs ""red blue green green green."" In this case, ""walm"" is at the end, and it generates ""green,"" repeating the color corresponding to the previous word ""dax,"" twice.

3. ""zup wif walm"" gives ""yellow red red red."" The word ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which correlates to ""red,"" and it repeats the color for each position in which ""walm"" stands.

4. ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and repeats the color twice.

5. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" results in ""green green green yellow blue blue blue."" The first ""walm"" repeats the ""green"" for ""dax,"" and the second ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" for ""lug"" twice.

From these patterns, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it for as many positions as it occupies in the input.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word for each position it occupies.",0.8,143,walm
"lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.",1.0,144,lug

"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" in the given examples consistently translates to the color ""blue.""",1.0,144,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the ""dax"" is associated with different colors based on its position or context. Let's analyze each example and see how ""dax"" is translated:

1. Input: dax lug wif bluf
   Output: green blue red red
   - ""dax"" at the beginning translates to ""green.""
   
2. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
   Output: blue green green yellow blue red
   - ""dax"" in the second position translates to ""green.""

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" at the beginning followed by ""walm"" translates to a repetition of ""green.""

4. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue
   - ""dax"" at the beginning translates to ""green.""

5. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red
   - ""dax"" appears in different positions always translating to ""green.""

Since in all examples, regardless of position, ""dax"" always translates to ""green,"" we can establish the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,144,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,144,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Thus:

"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence of words.",1.0,144,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,144,dax
"Observing the examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the outputs, irrespective of its position in the input string. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

wif -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,144,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" appears to correlate with the color ""red"" in every instance it is used. No matter its position within the input string, it outputs ""red."" Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" can be defined as follows:

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each given example.",1.0,144,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following pattern:

1. lug zup -> blue yellow means that ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
2. zup bluf wif -> yellow yellow red implies that ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" is another instance of ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""
3. wif zup -> red yellow confirms that ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""zup"" is still ""yellow.""
4. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green means that ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""green"" this time (not ""yellow"" as in example 2, which might indicate that ""bluf"" could have multiple meanings or be context-dependent).
5. zup dax -> yellow green further confirms that ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" is ""green.""

Considering the consistent translation of ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" we can establish the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,144,zup
"Rule: bluf -> red before wif, green before dax, and blue before lug.",1.0,144,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule related to the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's break down the given examples and look for patterns.

Examining each occurrence of ""bluf"" and its output:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf dax"" corresponds to ""red red green."" Since ""wif"" leads to ""red"" and ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" by process of elimination, ""bluf"" must correspond to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" corresponds to ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue."" Here, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" If ""bluf"" corresponded to a single color, it would have to be ""green"" to fit both occurrences, but we've already seen ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" in the first example.
- In the third example, ""dax zup lug bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow blue blue."" Since ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" here, it suggests that ""bluf"" doesn't correspond to a fixed color.
- In the fourth example, ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" corresponds to ""green yellow red red blue."" Here ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" again.
- In the fifth example, ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue green green yellow blue red."" In this scenario, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

From the above observations, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word that follows it:

- 1st example: ""bluf dax"" -> ""red green"" (and ""dax"" is ""green"")
- 2nd example: ""bluf wif"" -> ""green red"" (and ""wif"" is ""red"")
- 3rd example: ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"" (and ""bluf"" is the last word, so it repeats the previous word's color)
- 4th example: ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" (and ""wif"" is ""red"")
- 5th example: ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"" (and ""dax"" is ""green"")

However, the third example disrupts this pattern since ""bluf"" is the last word and there's no subsequent word for ""bluf"" to take the color from. Thus, when ""bluf"" is the last word, it seems to repeat the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> When ""bluf"" precedes a word, it takes the color of that word. When it is the last word, it takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,144,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to find patterns in the examples given, where the output is a sequence of colors. Examining each input-output pair, we are trying to match the nonce word ""bluf"" to the color it corresponds to in the output.

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
Rule: wif -> red, dax -> green, hence bluf -> red

Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
Rule: zup -> yellow, dax -> green, wif -> red, lug -> blue, therefore, bluf -> green

Input: dax zup lug bluf
Output: green yellow blue blue
Rule: dax -> green, zup -> yellow, lug -> blue, thus bluf -> blue

Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
Output: green yellow red red blue
Rule: dax -> green, zup -> yellow, wif -> red, lug -> blue, implying bluf -> red

Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
Output: blue green green yellow blue red
Rule: lug -> blue, dax -> green, zup -> yellow, wif -> red, deducing bluf -> green

By examining the patterns, we can deduce that ""bluf"" does not correspond to a single color but seems to take on the color that is directly preceding it in the input. This pattern is consistent in every example provided. 

Therefore, the rule seems to be: 

bluf -> the same color as the word that directly precedes it in the input sequence.",1.0,144,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns and consistencies in the output associated with its presence. Here's an analysis of each example:

1. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Since ""bluf"" is bracketed between two known words, it also outputs ""red,"" which may suggest ""bluf"" is the same as ""wif,"" or it may have a property that outputs ""red.""

2. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug

   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""bluf"" outputs ""green"" when following ""dax"" and ""yellow"" when following ""zup."" It does not output ""red"" following ""wif"" or ""blue"" following ""lug."" This suggests that ""bluf"" mimics the color of the word it follows, except when following ""red"" or ""blue.""

3. Input: dax zup lug bluf
   Output: green yellow blue blue
   - ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" following ""lug"" outputs ""blue."" This reinforces the possible rule that ""bluf"" mimics the preceding word's output unless it’s ""red"" or ""blue.""

4. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
   Output: green yellow red red blue
   - Following the previous patterns, ""bluf"" which comes after ""wif"" outputs ""red,"" confirming that ""bluf"" might mimic the color before it, but there are exceptions.

5. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
   Output: blue green green yellow blue red
   - Consistent with the previous examples, ""bluf"" after ""dax"" outputs ""green.""

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be: ""bluf"" outputs the same color as the word before it, unless that color is “red” or “blue,” in which case it outputs ""red"" following ""red"" (wif) and ""blue"" following ""blue"" (lug). This rule accounts for all the provided examples.

Rule: bluf -> outputs the same color as the preceding word, with exceptions for red and blue.",0.9,144,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to examine the instances where it appears and the corresponding output:

1. ""wif bluf dax"" corresponds to ""red red green.""
2. ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" corresponds to ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue.""
3. ""dax zup lug bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow blue blue.""
4. ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" corresponds to ""green yellow red red blue.""
5. ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue green green yellow blue red.""

Based on these examples, here is what can be deduced:

- The presence of ""bluf"" always corresponds to ""green"" when it follows ""dax"" or ""wif"" (as seen in examples 1, 2, and 4).
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" when it follows ""lug"" (as seen in examples 2 and 5).
- ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue"" when it is the last word before an output color is repeated (this is the case in example 4, where ""bluf"" precedes the repeat of ""red"" and in example 3 before ""blue"").

However, these examples alone are not enough to establish a consistent pattern for ""bluf"" because there seems to be a contradiction:

- In example 5, there isn’t a repetition of color after ""bluf"" but it still translates to ""green"".

So far, with the given examples, the most consistent rule is that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"" when following ""dax"" or ""wif."" To establish a more accurate rule, we would need to look for additional patterns or have more examples that clarify the contradiction observed.

Given the existing contradictions and the potential influence of context that is not yet clear, the current deduced rule is:

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" when it follows ""dax"" or ""wif,"" but there are inconsistencies that prevent a definitive rule from being established without more information.

Bluf -> meaning: Indeterminate; context-dependent meaning with a tendency to correspond to ""green” after ""dax"" or ""wif.""",0.7,144,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, ""walm"" correlates with the color ""green"". In every instance where the word ""walm"" is used, the corresponding output is ""green"". Additionally, whenever ""walm"" follows another word, the number of ""green"" in the output matches the number of words preceding ""walm"" plus one.

Rule:
walm -> the word ""walm"" is translated to a sequence of ""green"", with the number of ""green"" in the sequence being equal to the number of words preceding ""walm"" plus one.",1.0,144,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we can assess its impact on the sequence of output colors. Here are the observations:

1. When ""dax walm"" is input, the output is always ""green green green."" This suggests that ""dax walm"" leads to a series of green colors.
2. Whenever ""walm"" is present, it is followed by a consistent sequence of the same color, and that sequence's length corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" is said.
3. The output color that follows ""walm"" depends on the word that comes after ""walm."" 
    - When ""zup"" follows ""walm,"" the color is yellow.
    - When ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" the color is green.
    - When ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" the color is red.
4. When ""walm"" is at the end or followed by another ""walm,"" the color replicated is the color that would follow if another word were there (seems to repeat the last discernible color for the word before ""walm"").
5. We can note that ""walm"" in isolation with ""dax"" before it gives green, which aligns with the behavior that ""dax"" gives green.

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" acts as a repeat function for the next color in the sequence. If ""walm"" is followed by a word, it repeats the color that word would normally produce. If ""walm"" is at the end or followed by another ""walm,"" it repeats the last color that was produced before it.

Rule: walm -> repeats the next color in the sequence produced by the following word or repeats the last color produced if it is at the end.",0.9,144,walm
"To determine the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's examine each example and look for patterns corresponding to the output.

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green
- ""dax"" appears to correspond to ""green"" since each appearance is matched with green.
- ""lug"" is matched with ""blue.""
- ""zup"" is matched with ""yellow.""

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" matched with ""yellow"" again, supporting the earlier observation.
- The occurrence of ""walm"" seems to be followed by a repetition of the color mapped to the word after itself.

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
- ""wif"" is matched with ""red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds with ""green.""

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow
- ""wif"" and ""dax"" match with ""red"" and ""green"" respectively.
- ""zup"" is matched with ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" once again causes a repetition of the mapped color of the subsequent word.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- With no subsequent word, we might expect no color; however, ""green"" is repeated three times.

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be deduced:

walm -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the following word, filling three slots of output. If no word follows, then the color associated with ""dalm"" will be outputted three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears after a word, the color mapped to that word is repeated three times. If ""walm"" is the last word, then ""green"" is repeated three times (possibly because ""dax"" often appears before ""walm"" and is associated with ""green"").",0.9,144,walm
"walm -> meaning. 

Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to cause the following word to repeat its corresponding color in the output sequence. When the word ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" ""dax"" is normally associated with the color green, so after ""walm,"" the word ""dax"" leads to a repetition of the color green. Likewise, when ""walm"" precedes ""zup,"" which is associated with yellow, the output after ""walm"" is a repetition of the color yellow. Similarly, ""walm"" followed by ""wif"" results in the repetition of red. It appears that ""walm"" has no color association of its own but solely affects the next word. However, if ""walm"" appears at the end (no word follows it), the color green is repeated.",0.8,144,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at the pattern of inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   - We can see that 'dax' at the start and at the end both correspond to 'green'. The word 'walm' also corresponds to 'green', 'zup' to 'yellow' and 'lug' to 'blue' in this sequence. 

2. Input: dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
   - Again, 'dax' corresponds to 'green' and 'zup' to 'yellow'. The word 'walm' corresponds to 'green' and repeating 'walm' following 'zup' leads to repeated 'yellow', so there seems to be a rule where 'walm' may influence the following color.

3. Input: wif walm dax 
   Output: red red red green
   - 'wif' and 'walm' correspond to 'red', and 'dax' again corresponds to 'green'.

4. Input: dax walm wif walm zup 
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   - 'dax' corresponds to 'green', 'wif' to 'red', 'zup' to 'yellow'. 'walm' appears to replicate the color corresponding to the following word. So when 'walm' is before 'wif', it produces 'red', and when it's before 'zup', it leads to 'yellow'.

5. Input: dax walm 
   Output: green green green
   - As in previous cases, 'dax' corresponds to 'green', and without a following word, 'walm' also corresponds to 'green'.

From these examples, it seems 'walm' serves as a replicator of the color linked to the word that follows it. If 'walm' appears with no word after it, it defaults to 'green'.

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the following word. If there is no following word, the default color is green.",0.8,144,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Words like ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""walm"" correspond to colors ""yellow,"" ""red,"" ""green,"" and a repeat of the previously mentioned color, respectively.

- When ""dax"" comes after ""wif"" or before ""lug,"" it also translates to ""green.""
- No examples were provided where ""dax"" follows ""lug"" or precedes ""wif,"" so we cannot conclude its output in those scenarios.

According to these observations, a working rule for the meaning of ""dax"" with respect to the output colors can be formulated. We do not have negative examples to refine the rule further, nor do we have examples of ""dax"" in other contexts, so the rule is quite simple.

Rule: dax -> green

"Based on the examples provided, the output changes color whenever the word ""dax"" is introduced into a sequence. The color associated with ""dax"" does not appear to depend on the surrounding words, as ""dax"" produces ""green"" regardless of whether it is surrounded by other words or stands alone. This suggests that ""dax"" itself is associated with the color ""green."" Additionally, the other words in the sequence appear to consistently produce the same color outputs (""wif"" yields ""red,"" ""lug"" yields ""blue,"" ""bluf"" yields ""green,"" and ""walm"" yields ""blue""), indicating that the system assigns specific colors to specific words regardless of their order or frequency in the sequence.

"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"":

Rule: zup -> yellow

The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,145,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's consider each example and their outputs:

1. Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red

2. Input: dax bluf wif lug
   Output: green green red blue

3. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red

4. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
   Output: blue red blue green green

5. Input: wif zup bluf
   Output: red yellow yellow

Analyzing these patterns, one can notice that bluf takes the color value of the word immediately preceding it. For example, in example 1, the first bluf follows lug, which is blue, and thus the first bluf translates to blue. The second bluf also follows zup which is yellow, and the second bluf translates to yellow.

Considering all the instances:

- bluf follows lug (blue) -> bluf becomes blue in output
- bluf follows zup (yellow) -> bluf becomes yellow in output
- bluf follows dax (green) -> bluf becomes green in output
- bluf follows wif (red) -> bluf becomes red in output

So the rule is:

Rule: bluf takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,145,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the corresponding outputs for each instance where ""bluf"" appears:

1. zup lug bluf zup bluf wif -> yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
2. dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue
3. dax wif bluf -> green red red
4. lug wif lug dax bluf -> blue red blue green green
5. wif zup bluf -> red yellow yellow

From these examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- In example 1, the first instance of ""bluf"" translates to the word ""blue,"" which is the same as the preceding word ""lug."" The second instance of ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow,"" which is the same as the preceding word ""zup.""
- In example 2, ""bluf"" translates to ""green,"" which is the same as the preceding word ""dax.""

- In example 4, ""bluf"" translates to ""green,"" which is the same as the preceding word ""dax.""
- In example 5, ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow,"" which is the same as the preceding word ""zup.""

It appears that ""bluf"" takes on the value of the color word immediately preceding it in the sequence. Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the word before it.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in which the word appears and how they correlate to the color output.

From the examples given:

- Whenever the word 'walm' appears after 'lug', the output is 'blue blue blue'.
- After 'dax', 'walm' translates to 'green green green'.
- It seems that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word before it three times.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at each input and its corresponding output to identify patterns.

1. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to a single ""blue.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red.""
   - The nonce word ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and is followed by three ""red.""

2. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   - Each ""lug"" corresponds to a single ""blue.""
   - The first ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" and between them are two ""blue.""
   - The second ""walm"" is at the end and is followed by two ""blue.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""wif"" is preceded by two ""green"" from ""walm"" and is followed by ""red.""
   - ""zup"" is ""yellow"" after the second ""walm.""

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" is ""green.""
   - ""lug"" is ""blue.""
   - We see three ""blue"" at the end, suggesting that ""walm"" leads to repeating the preceding color.

5. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""lug"" is ""blue.""
   - ""walm"" leads to two more ""blue.""
   - ""zup"" occurs after ""walm"" and is ""yellow.""
   - ""wif"" is ""red.""

Looking across all examples, each time ""walm"" is present, it repeats the color of the word that precedes it two more times. Therefore, we can deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" as follows:

Walm -> Meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word two times.

Rule: If ""X"" precedes ""walm"" and the color of ""X"" is ""Y,"" then ""walm"" generates two more instances of ""Y.""",1.0,145,walm
"In order to deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to examine the pattern of outputs relative to the inputs containing the word ""walm,"" and consider what aspect of the input the outputs could be representing.

Let us list the instances of ""walm"" and the corresponding parts of the output:

1. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
2. lug walm zup lug walm -> blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
3. dax walm wif walm zup -> green green green red red red yellow
4. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
5. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red

Let us analyze:

- In all instances, the output after ""walm"" is a sequence of the same color.
- The color following ""walm"" in the output sequence matches the color that was produced by the first word in the input before ""walm.""
- It appears that ""walm"" operates on the preceding input word and translates into the same color being repeated two or three times.

Now, let's see how many times ""walm"" produces a repeated color:

1. wif walm -> red red red (3 times)
2. lug walm -> blue blue blue (3 times)
3. dax walm wif walm -> green green green red red red (3 times each)
4. lug walm -> blue blue blue (3 times)
5. wif walm -> red red red (3 times)

From the patterns above, we can see that ""walm"" results in the preceding color being repeated three times. Now, this rule holds true in all the observed examples.

Rule: walm -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

Let's test this with a more explicit statement:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word in the input, the output is the color corresponding to that word repeated three times.",1.0,145,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the relationship between the input and the output in each example.

In the first example:
- Input: lug wif walm
- Output: blue red red red

Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Since ""walm"" generates three ""red"" in a row, it may imply repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

In the second example:
- Input: lug walm zup lug walm
- Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and the ""walm"" that follows repeats ""blue"" another two times. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" but there's no walm after ""zup"" to confirm the repetition rule for ""zup.""

In the third example:
- Input: dax walm wif walm zup
- Output: green green green red red red yellow

Here ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats the ""green"" two more times. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" then ""walm"" repeats ""red"" two more times. ""zup"" is ""yellow"" without repetition as there is no walm after it.

In the fourth example:
- Input: dax lug walm
- Output: green blue blue blue

Here ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" two more times after ""lug.""

In the fifth example:
- Input: lug walm zup wif
- Output: blue blue blue yellow red

Here, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats the ""blue"" two times. ""zup"" is ""yellow"" without repetition as there is no ""walm"" after it, and ""wif"" is ""red"" without repetition.

Here are the examples revisited:

- Input: wif -> Output: red
- Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm -> Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red
- Input: wif -> Output: red
- Input: wif dax zup wif -> Output: red green yellow red

From the given examples, every single input instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red.""

Rule:
- wif -> red

Thus, the rule deduced from the examples provided is that ""wif"" means ""red.""",1.0,146,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". In each instance where ""wif"" is mentioned, the output includes the word ""red"". However, without understanding the rules that apply to the other words such as ""walm"", ""zup"", ""lug"", and ""dax"", we cannot fully explain the pattern of the additional colors in the output. Thus, with the information provided, we can conclude:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,146,wif
"Given the examples, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. Here is the rule as per each nonce word:

- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""walm"" corresponds to the color red repeated three times.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Based on this pattern, the rule appears to be that each nonce word represents a color, and in the case of ""walm"", a repetition of the color three times.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,146,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" we need to look at the patterns where it is used and analyze how it translates to the output. Here are the observations:

1. Every instance of ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" suggesting a direct conversion from ""wif"" to ""red.""
2. Regardless of the other words present or their order, ""wif"" consistently results in ""red.""
3. There are no examples where ""wif"" leads to any output other than ""red.""

From these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" 

So, wif -> red.",1.0,146,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the term ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Here's how we can determine this:

- In every example, regardless of the other words present (""wif"", ""bluf"", ""dax"", ""walm""), the presence of ""zup"" results in the word ""yellow"" in the output.
- It does not seem to matter where ""zup"" appears in the sequence; its position does not affect its meaning.
- Other words like ""wif"", ""bluf"", ""dax"", ""walm"" correspond to different colors every time they appear, suggesting their output may depend on their position or sequence. ""Zup,"" on the other hand, consistently maps to ""yellow.""

So, the rule that can be deduced for the word ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,146,zup
"From the examples given, it appears that the word 'zup' correlates with a particular color in the output, specifically 'yellow'. Regardless of the position of 'zup' within the input sequence or the other words surrounding it, it consistently results in 'yellow' in the output. Therefore, the rule can be established as:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,146,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the word ""yellow"". Here's the break-down:

- Every instance of ""zup"" in every input results in ""yellow"" appearing in the same position in the output.
- Other words in inputs, such as ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" and ""dax,"" result in colors ""red,"" ""red,"" and ""green,"" respectively, but these words produce outputs based on their position or pairings with other words.
- ""Zup"" is the only word that does not depend on position or other factors to be assigned its output color which is ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,146,zup
"Given the examples, we can infer the color associated with each word by comparing the inputs and outputs. The recurrent word in every input before a color change is ""zup,"" and the color following this word in the output is consistently ""yellow."" So it seems that ""zup"" is linked to the color ""yellow"" in the output. No other word appears to consistently map to the color yellow in these examples, no matter the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,146,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Explanation: In each example, the presence of the word ""zup"" always corresponds to the output ""yellow,"" regardless of the position of ""zup"" within the input sequence or the other words around it. No other word in the inputs consistently translates to ""yellow,"" thus we induce that ""zup"" denotes the color yellow.",1.0,146,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" generates colors that correspond to the previously mentioned item when one exists, and defaults to ""yellow"" when it is the first item.

Here's the breakdown of each example:

- In the first input ""zup wif bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Since ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it outputs ""red.""
- In ""zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and, therefore, repeats the color of ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- In ""dax bluf wif zup wif,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""Bluf"" takes the color of ""dax,"" thus ""green,"" since it comes right after it.
- In ""lug bluf wif,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" takes on the color ""blue"" since it follows directly after ""lug.""
- ""Lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" has ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax"" corresponding to ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""green,"" respectively. ""Bluf"" follows ""dax,"" so it takes on the green color. Another ""wif"" remains red, and the final ""lug"" is ""blue.""

Thus, the rule seems to be:
bluf -> Repeat the color of the immediately preceding item, if no preceding item, then ""yellow"".

Rule: If an item precedes ""bluf,"" use that item's color; if ""bluf"" is the first item, use ""yellow"".",1.0,146,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" represents a color that is the same as the color word immediately preceding it. To support this, let's examine the patterns:

1. In the first example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" followed by ""wif bluf"" which results in ""red red."" Therefore ""bluf"" appears to take on the color of ""wif"" (red).

2. The second example shows ""zup bluf"" becoming ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""bluf"" again takes the color of the preceding word, ""zup"" (yellow).

3. The third example, ""dax bluf wif zup wif,"" translates to ""green green red yellow red."" Here, ""bluf"" immediately follows ""dax,"" which means ""green,"" thus ""bluf"" is again ""green.""

4. In the fourth example, ""lug bluf wif"" translates to ""blue blue red."" The word ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" follows, so it also means ""blue.""

5. In the fifth example, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""blue red green green red blue."" ""Dax"" means ""green,"" and it's followed by ""bluf,"" resulting in ""green,"" once again implying that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is the color of the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,146,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's break down each example by observing the input and corresponding output.

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

From this, we can associate ""zup"" with ""yellow"" and ""wif"" with ""red,"" leaving the meaning of ""bluf"" undetermined.

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

This example suggests that ""bluf"" could mean ""yellow,"" as ""zup"" also translates to ""yellow"" and there are no other contrasting colors to suggest otherwise.

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
Output: green green red yellow red

Here we note that ""dax"" equals ""green,"" ""wif"" equals ""red,"" and ""zup"" is confirmed again as ""yellow."" The remaining ""bluf"" is aligned with ""green.""

Input: lug bluf wif
Output: blue blue red

""Lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" again is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" in this context translates to ""blue.""

Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
Output: blue red green green red blue

In this example, since ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax"" have already been associated with ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""green,"" respectively, the remaining ""bluf"" must translate as ""green"" again.

From the examples provided, a pattern emerges where ""bluf"" seems to take the same color as the word before it:

- When following ""zup"" (which is ""yellow""), ""bluf"" gives ""yellow.""
- When following ""dax"" (which is ""green""), ""bluf"" gives ""green.""
- When following ""lug"" (which is ""blue""), ""bluf"" gives ""blue.""

Thus, the rule is:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word. If there is no preceding word, it defaults to ""yellow"" (as seen in the second example).",0.9,146,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the consistency across the examples relative to their position and output color.

- In example 2, ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" might mean ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup.""
- However, in example 1, ""zup wif bluf"" gives us ""yellow red red,"" where ""bluf"" cannot mean ""yellow"" because it comes after ""wif"" and results in ""red.""
- In example 3, ""dax bluf wif zup wif,"" ""bluf"" again follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green green."" This suggests that ""bluf"" means ""green"" after ""dax.""
- Example 4, ""lug bluf wif,"" gives us ""blue blue red,"" so ""bluf"" here means ""blue"" after ""lug.""
- Finally, in example 5, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" outputs ""blue red green green red blue,"" and if we isolate just the ""dax bluf"" part, we again see that ""bluf"" means ""green"" after ""dax.""

From these observations, we can discern that ""bluf"" doesn't have a fixed meaning but rather takes on the color of the word that precedes it. This can be inferred from the fact that ""bluf"" mirrors the color associated with the preceding word every time:

- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" means yellow.
- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"" because ""dax"" means green.
- ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" means blue.

Rule: bluf -> ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it.",0.9,146,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> duplicate the color of the word that comes after bluf. If there is no word after bluf, duplicate the color of bluf itself.",0.0,146,bluf
"walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" follows a color-coded word, the color corresponding to that word is repeated three times in the output. 

- ""zup"" correlates to the color ""yellow""
- ""lug"" correlates to the color ""blue""
- ""dax"" correlates to the color ""green""

Therefore, when ""zup"", ""lug"", or ""dax"" precede ""walm"", their associated colors are repeated three times in the output sequence.",1.0,146,walm
"walm -> repeating the color associated with the previous word three times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, it results in the color associated with that preceding word being said three times. Here's the mapping based on the examples provided:

- ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow.
- ""dax"" is associated with the color green.
- ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.

So, ""walm"" following ""zup,"" ""dax,"" or ""lug"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow,"" ""green green green,"" or ""blue blue blue"" respectively.",1.0,146,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to cause the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. Additionally, it appears that each nonce word maps to a specific color:

- ""lug"" maps to ""blue""

Also, ""wif"" translates to ""red"" but does not seem to be affected by the repetition rule. Hence, ""walm"" likely means ""repeat the color of the previous word three times.""

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times",1.0,146,walm
"walm -> triple repetition of a color associated with the word preceding ""walm"". Rule:

When the word ""walm"" appears after another word, it means to repeat the color associated with that preceding word three times.

- ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow.
- ""dax"" is associated with the color green.
- ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.
- ""wif"" stands for red, but it doesn’t cause repetition since it doesn't precede the word ""walm"".",1.0,146,walm

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word that is associated with a color, the output is the color corresponding to the preceding word repeated three times. For example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"".",1.0,146,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The term ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples.",1.0,147,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer that the nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the outputs. Here is the justification based on the given input and output pairs:

- When ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" consistently appears in the output at the corresponding position.
- The input words ""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""bluf"" correlate with ""red,"" ""green,"" ""yellow,"" and ""red"" respectively, regardless of the position in which they appear.
- The position of ""lug"" in the input does not affect its translation to ""blue"" in the output; it always corresponds to ""blue.""

Therefore, we can state the rule as:

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax"", let's focus on instances where it appears and what output comes after it.

1. First example, ""dax"" appears before ""lug"" and ""walm"" leading to ""green"" before ""blue"" and ""blue blue"".
2. In the second example, ""dax"" appears before ""lug"" and ""bluf"", once again leading to ""green"" before ""blue"" and the second ""dax"" before ""zup"" leads to ""green"" before ""yellow"".
3. In the third example, ""dax"" appears before ""lug"" and ""walm"", resulting in ""green"" before ""blue"" and ""green green"".
4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" appears before ""lug"" and ""zup"", and as before, ""green"" is the color appearing before ""blue"" and ""yellow"". Also, ""dax"" before ""walm"" again leads to ""green"" before ""green green"".
5. The fifth example again shows ""dax"" before ""zup"" leading to ""green"" before ""yellow"".

From these observations, it seems that ""dax"" on its own translates to ""green"". The context does not appear to change the meaning of ""dax"". Thus, the rule seems to be:

Word order seems to be preserved between input and output.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,147,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples provided, each time 'zup' is mentioned in the input, the word 'yellow' appears in the corresponding position in the output, regardless of the surrounding words. Therefore, the word 'zup' translates to 'yellow'.",1.0,147,zup

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red.""

This pattern suggests that ""bluf"" acts as a signal to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Thus, we can define the rule for ""bluf"" as follows:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Therefore:

- When ""lug"" follows ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue.""
- When ""zup"" follows ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""wif"" follows ""bluf,"" the output is ""red.""

Notably, the color ""green"" is related to the word ""dax,"" ""blue"" to ""lug,"" ""yellow"" to ""zup,"" and ""red"" to ""wif."" These pairs hold constant even when they aren't immediately adjacent. Thus, we can infer that ""bluf"" does not have a meaning on its own; instead, it indicates that the color of the following word should be duplicated.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> indicates that the next word's associated color should be repeated in the output.",0.8,147,bluf
"Rule: ""bluf"" results in outputting the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it, but twice.",0.8,147,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" by comparing the inputs and outputs:

2. ""lug zup bluf dax"" yields ""blue yellow yellow green"". Here, ""lug"" gives us ""blue"", ""zup"" gives us ""yellow"", ""bluf"" again results in ""yellow"", and ""dax"" ends with ""green"".

3. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue"". Using the previous patterns, ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and the second occurrence of ""zup"" confirms ""yellow"". Following this pattern, ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" once more, as does the final ""lug"".

4. ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" converts to ""yellow red red yellow blue"". Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""wif"" is ""red"", ""bluf"" results in ""red"" as well, and the remaining ""zup"" and ""lug"" give us ""yellow"" and ""blue"", respectively.

5. ""wif bluf lug zup"" corresponds to ""red red blue yellow"". ""Wif"" equates to ""red"", ""bluf"" also yields ""red"", ""lug"" produces ""blue"", and ""zup"" provides ""yellow"".

By consistently analyzing the pattern, it seems that ""bluf"" outputs the same color as the preceding non-bluf word. So if a word outputs a certain color, then the following ""bluf"" will output the same color, as observed in examples 2, and 4.

Rule: bluf -> The same color as the color outputted by the word immediately before it.",0.8,147,bluf
"Reviewing the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the rule that defines the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

1. In the first example:
   - Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax

   - Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   - Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

5. In the fifth example:
   - Input: dax walm
   - Output: green green green

Looking at the examples, the appearance of the word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here are the specific observations:

- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and its corresponding output color ""blue"" is repeated once.
- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and its corresponding output color ""yellow"" is repeated.
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and its corresponding output color ""red"" is repeated.
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and its corresponding output color ""blue"" is repeated.
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and its corresponding output color ""green"" is repeated.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in an input sequence, the output color is a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm.""

Therefore, the definition can be stated as:

walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the output color associated with the word right before it.",1.0,147,walm
"Upon examining the provided examples, the following patterns are observed:

1. Each 'walm' is followed by a set of identical colors.
2. The number of identical colors following 'walm' matches the number of tokens preceding 'walm'.
3. The color following 'walm' is always the same as the color assigned to the token immediately preceding 'walm'.

Given these observations, we can deduce that 'walm' indicates a repetition of the color corresponding to the token that comes before 'walm', and the number of repetitions is equal to the total number of tokens before 'walm'.

walm -> meaning. Rule: 'walm' causes the color of the previous token to be repeated for a number equal to the count of tokens before 'walm'.",1.0,147,walm
"Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the color for ""lug"" is blue, so ""walm"" also produces blue.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the color for ""zup"" is yellow, so ""walm"" results in yellow.
- In the third example, there's only ""wif"" before ""walm,"" associated with red, so ""walm"" results in red.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" associated with blue, replicating the blue color.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and since ""dax"" is associated with green, ""walm"" also results in green.",1.0,147,walm
"To figure out what ""walm"" means, we'll observe the patterns in the input-output pairs:

1. Input: **dax lug walm** dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue **blue** blue green red red green
   - Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" which is green, preceded by ""lug"" which corresponds to blue.

2. Input: zup bluf lug zup **walm**
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow **yellow yellow**
   - ""walm"" is at the end and corresponds to a repetition of the color of the preceding word, ""zup,"" which is yellow.

3. Input: wif **walm** dax
   Output: red **red** red green
   - Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which is red and is followed by ""dax,"" which is green. ""Walm"" takes the color of the preceding word.

4. Input: wif zup bluf lug **walm**
   Output: red yellow yellow blue **blue blue**
   - Similar to the first input, ""walm"" takes the color of the word right before it, ""lug"" which is blue.

5. Input: dax **walm**
   Output: green **green green**
   - Once again, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is green, and the output is green repeated.

From these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it. If there's no word after ""walm,"" the output color is repeated twice.

Rule: walm -> Takes the color of the preceding word in the sequence. If it's the last word, the output color repeats.",1.0,147,walm
"To deduce what ""walm"" means, let's analyze the patterns in the given examples:

1. Every time the word ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" is in the output.
2. Every time the word ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" is in the output.
3. Every time the word ""bluf"" appears, the color ""blue"" is in the output.
4. Every time the word ""lug"" appears, it is followed by a ""blue"" in the output.
5. Every time the word ""zup"" appears, the color ""yellow"" appears multiple times in the output.

Let's look at the sequences containing ""walm"":

- In the first example:
  - ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" leads to ""green blue blue blue green red red green""
  - After ""lug walm"", blue is repeated, suggesting that maybe ""walm"" causes a repetition of the previous color.

- In the second example:
  - ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
  - ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which is associated with multiple yellows, suggesting that ""walm"" might continue the pattern set by ""zup"".

- In the third example:
  - ""wif walm dax"" leads to ""red red red green""
  - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and is associated with a repeated ""red"".

- In the fourth example:
  - ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" leads to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue""
  - ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" and blue is repeated again.

- In the fifth example:
  - ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green""
  - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the color ""green"" is repeated.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to repeat. If there is no previous word, then ""walm"" repeats the color of the next word.

2. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue
   Similarly, we notice ""dax"" precedes ""lug"" and outputs ""green blue.""

3. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax

5. Input: wif dax zup walm

   Here, ""dax"" follows ""wif"" and the output for ""dax"" is ""green.""

From these examples, the output ""green"" consistently corresponds to the input ""dax,"" regardless of its position or what it follows. Therefore, it's reasonable to deduce that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

3. Input: zup bluf

4. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax

5. Input: wif bluf

From these examples, we can notice that every time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at a corresponding position. Moreover, ""bluf"" never appears alone; it's always prefixed by another nonce word. The word ""bluf"" always causes ""red"" to appear in the output regardless of its position in the input.

The word that precedes ""bluf"" in the input seems to have no effect on the output for ""bluf,"" as it is consistently translated to ""red"" even though ""wif"" and ""zup"" lead to different colors for their own translations (""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively).

- In the second example, ""dax walm zup lug"" turns into ""green green green yellow blue"". Here, the ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and the ""walm"" after it means repeating ""green"" three times.

- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red"" (repeating red).

Thus, in all instances, ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,149,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we examine the specific positions where the word ""walm"" is used and the corresponding outputs in each example.

In the first input, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output sequence is three ""red"" colors in a row. In the standard English color pattern of a rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet), there is no repetition of three ""red"" colors in a row, so we can assume ""walm"" is not a straight mapping to a color name but potentially involves repetition of the preceding color.

In the second input, ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and before ""zup lug zup,"" with the corresponding colors being ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red."" Emphasizing the term ""lug walm"" in the output yields ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" may mean to repeat the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) two additional times, for a total of three iterations of the same color.

The third input, ""zup walm dax,"" results in the output ""yellow yellow yellow green."" Given that ""zup"" is associated with yellow and ""dax"" with green, and the two instances of ""yellow"" following ""zup walm"" suggest that like in the previous examples, ""walm"" prompts a repetition of the previous color two more times (a total of three consecutive repetitions).

For the fourth input, where ""walm"" appears after two instances of ""wif"" and before ""lug wif,"" the output contains ""red red green green red red red blue red"" where the sequence ""red red red"" follows ""walm."" Again, ""walm"" appears to indicate a repetition of the previous color instance two more times after its occurrence.

In the last input, ""lug walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" once more showing that ""walm"" is followed by two additional instances of the previous color (blue), making it apparent that ""walm"" indicates triple repetition.

Rule: 

walm -> Leads to a repetition of the color associated with the directly preceding word for a total of three times, including the initial instance.",1.0,149,walm
"Based on the examples given, the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be bound to the following rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" is present, repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm"" for the same number of times as the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence, counting from the beginning of the input.

Let's break down the examples to illustrate this:

1. lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red
""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with the color ""red"", ""walm"" is the fifth word in the sequence, so ""red"" is repeated five times.

2. lug walm zup lug zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
In this case, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with the color ""blue"", ""walm"" is the second word, so ""blue"" is repeated twice.

3. zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green
""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with ""yellow"", ""walm"" is in the second position, thus ""yellow"" is repeated twice after the initial occurrence for a total of three times.

4. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> red red green green red red red blue red
""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with ""red"", ""walm"" is the sixth word, therefore ""red"" is repeated six times.

5. lug walm -> blue blue blue
""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with ""blue"", ""walm"" is in the second position, so ""blue"" is repeated twice after the initial occurrence for a total of three times.

Therefore, the rule for “walm” seems to be:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word a number of times equal to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.",1.0,149,walm
"walm -> repeat the previous color.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is used following another word, the color associated with the previous word is repeated the number of times indicated by the sequence of ""walm"" until a different word appears.

Examples of the application of the rule:
- In the first example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to red, and the presence of ""walm"" indicates repeating the color red.
- In the second example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" dictates a repetition of blue.
- The same pattern is followed in all other examples given.",1.0,149,walm
"To deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns in which it appears and the corresponding outputs.

- In the first example, when ""lug wif zup wif walm"" is input, the output is ""blue red yellow red red red"". The sequence ""wif walm"" is followed by ""red red red"", indicating ""walm"" may represent an instruction to repeat the color associated with ""wif"", which is red.

- In the second example, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"". Here ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"", suggesting again that ""walm"" may indicate repeating the same color multiple times.

- In the third example, ""zup walm dax"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow green"". As ""zup"" is associated with yellow, the ""walm"" seems again to cause a repetition of yellow.

- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" results in ""red red green green red red red blue red"", where ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red."" Again, ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, ""wif"" (red).

- In the fifth example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"". Similar to the previous patterns, ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it, ""lug"" (blue).

From these examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

Given this rule, we can express the meaning of ""walm"" as:

walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,149,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we can look at the corresponding outputs for each input containing ""walm"":

1. ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red"" in the output.
2. ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"" in the output.
3. ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"" in the output.
4. ""wif walm lug wif"" corresponds to ""red red red blue red"" in the output.

It seems that ""walm"" repeats the color linked to the preceding word in the series three times. To further confirm:

- After ""lug"" (which outputs ""blue""), ""walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue.""
- After ""zup"" (which outputs ""yellow""), ""walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- After ""wif"" (which outputs ""red""), ""walm"" leads to ""red red red.""

"To deduce the meaning or rule for ""dax,"" let's analyze the given examples by comparing the inputs and outputs to look for patterns. We'll start by looking for consistent mappings from the inputs to the outputs for each non-""dax"" word.

Here are the explicit mappings we can derive:

- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> red
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red

Notice that each occurrence of ""dax"" in the inputs is mapped to ""green"" in the outputs. Across all examples, ""dax"" does not seem to be affected by neighboring words, the position in the sequence, or the number of times it appears. It consistently maps to ""green.""

- The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" every time it is used.
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the one instance it is used.
- The word ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" every time it is used.

With the given information, it seems like ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,150,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, every instance where the nonce word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. This consistent substitution suggests that ""dax"" translates to ""green.""",1.0,150,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" I'll look at where it appears in each input and compare it to the corresponding output.

Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
**Analysis**: 'dax' appears after 'zup' and before 'bluf', producing 'green'. 'zup' correlates with 'yellow', 'bluf' with 'yellow', and 'lug' with 'blue'. 'wif' appears once and correlates with 'red'.

Input: lug zup dax lug dax
Output: blue yellow green blue green
**Analysis**: 'dax' appears after 'zup' and before 'lug' first, and it corresponds with 'green'. The same applies when 'dax' appears at the end.

Input: zup lug zup dax
Output: yellow blue yellow green
**Analysis**: 'dax' appears after 'zup' again and translates to 'green'.

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
**Analysis**: 'dax' appears at the beginning and is followed by 'walm', which we haven't seen before. 'dax walm' together correspond to 'green green'. 'zup' still correlates with 'yellow' and 'walm' appears to correspond with 'yellow' following 'zup'.

Input: wif lug dax
Output: red blue green
**Analysis**: 'dax' appears at the end after 'lug', which correlates with 'blue'. 'wif' corresponds with 'red'.

Rule:
From the given examples, 'dax' always results in 'green' regardless of the position it occupies in the sequence or the words that come before or after it.

So the rule is: dax -> green.",1.0,150,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at each example and identify patterns relating to the output.

1. ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red green red red""
   Observations:
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""wif"" appears twice and each time it is followed by ""red""

2. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
   Observations:
   - No other words from the previous example are present to correlate with colors.
   - ""wif"" appears once and is followed by ""red""

3. ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" -> ""blue red red blue red""
   Observations:
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""wif"" appears twice and each time it is followed by ""red""

4. ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" -> ""blue green green red green""
   Observations:
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""red""

5. ""zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow green red""
   Observations:
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""red""

Given these observations, a pattern arises: the word ""wif"" is consistently followed by the output ""red."" There are no deviations or context dependencies observed that affect this output. Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,150,wif
"Based on the examples provided, every time the word ""wif"" appears, it is followed by the word ""red"" in the output. Therefore, we can deduce that ""wif"" translates to ""red"".

Rule: 
wif -> red",1.0,150,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,150,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red' regardless of its position or the context within the sequence of other words.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,150,wif
"Based on the examples given, it seems that the word ""wif"" serves as a marker that triggers a change in the output sequence. Specifically, whenever ""wif"" appears, the output word that immediately follows is ""red."" The word that appears just before ""wif"" does not seem to influence the output that follows ""wif,"" as ""wif"" consistently results in ""red"" regardless of the preceding word.

Here is the breakdown per example to illustrate the rule:

1. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red
   (""wif"" after ""zup"" and before ""dax"" results in ""red""; ""wif"" before ""bluf"" results in ""red"")

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   (The first ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and the sequence continues unchanged.)

3. Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
   Output: blue red red blue red
   (""wif"" after ""lug"" and before ""bluf"" results in ""red""; ""wif"" with no word after it still results in ""red"")

4. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
   Output: blue green green red green
   (""wif"" after ""bluf"" results in ""red"")

5. Input: zup dax wif
   Output: yellow green red
   (""wif"" after ""dax"" results in ""red"")

Based on the information gathered from the examples, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be:

Rule: ""wif"" results in the output ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Thus, we can write:

wif -> red",1.0,150,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" seems to be consistent across all instances. Regardless of the context or the words that come before or after it, ""zup"" always translates to the same color in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,150,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" There are no examples where ""zup"" leads to a different output or is influenced by other words around it. 

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,150,zup
"Based on the presented examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"". Each time ""zup"" is used in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,150,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Every time ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: 
zup -> yellow",1.0,150,zup
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the word ""zup"" seems to be constant across different contexts. In each occurrence, regardless of the surrounding words, ""zup"" corresponds to the same output.

Here is the rule based on the examples:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" is included in the output at the corresponding position.",1.0,150,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" causes the word that immediately precedes it to be repeated. The output is always a repeated color that corresponds to the word just before ""bluf"".

Here's how the rule applies to the given examples:

- Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red (The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""; ""bluf"" causes it to be repeated.)
- Input: dax bluf zup -> Output: green green yellow (The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""; ""bluf"" causes it to be repeated. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".)
- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue (The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""; ""bluf"" causes ""zup"" to be repeated. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and it is followed by another word ""walm"" that also corresponds to ""blue"", then ""dax"" which is ""green"" followed by ""lug"" again resulting in ""blue."")
- Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red (Similar to the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""; ""bluf"" causes it to be repeated.)
- Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red (Similar to the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""; ""bluf"" causes it to be repeated.)

Rule: bluf -> causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to be repeated.",1.0,150,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. In each example, the color that follows ""bluf"" is a repeat of the color associated with the word directly before ""bluf"". Using this observation, we can derive the following rule:

bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.

Let's apply this rule to the examples:

- In ""wif bluf"", ""wif"" outputs ""red"", and ""bluf"" repeats the ""red"".
- In ""dax bluf zup"", ""dax"" outputs ""green"", and ""bluf"" repeats the ""green"". ""zup"" following ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow"".
- In ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"", ""wif"" outputs ""red"", ""zup"" outputs ""yellow"", ""bluf"" repeats the ""yellow"" from ""zup"", ""lug"" outputs ""blue"", ""walm"" follows the pattern becoming blue as well, and ""dax"" produces ""green"" followed by ""lug"" with ""blue"" again.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,150,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,1.0,150,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the corresponding output colors for each input, especially considering its position with respect to other words. From the examples given:

Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
Input: dax bluf zup -> Output: green green yellow
Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red

Based on these examples, it appears that the presence of the word ""bluf"" reinforces or duplicates the color associated with the word preceding it. In every example, ""bluf"" generates an output that is a repetition of the color corresponding to the word before ""bluf."" In other words, ""bluf"" makes the previous color appear twice.

For instance:

- When ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
- When ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""
- In a longer sequence, ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue,"" followed by ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and then ""lug,"" which still corresponds to ""blue."" When followed by ""bluf,"" the color of ""dax"" is the one that gets repeated (""green""), being the color immediately preceding ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to be outputted twice.",1.0,150,bluf
"Rule: ""bluf"" is duplicated in the output color sequence. The color it translates into depends on the preceding word. For instance, when ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color red is produced twice. Similarly, when ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color green is produced twice. Thus, ""bluf"" takes the color of the previous word and doubles it in the output. 

bluf -> Duplicate the color of the preceding word in the output sequence.",1.0,150,bluf
"Analyzing the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately follows it three times. Here's how it works with the provided examples:

1. ""lug walm wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red red"", with ""walm wif"" yielding ""blue blue blue.""
2. In ""zup walm lug wif bluf"", the sequence ""walm lug"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow.""
3. ""zup walm"" by itself gives ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" causes the repeat of the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow).
4. In ""wif walm dax zup,"" the part ""walm dax"" produces ""red red red,"" following the color repetition rule for ""wif.""
5. ""zup wif walm"" leads to ""yellow red red red"", where ""walm"" is following ""wif"" and hence repeats ""red"" three times.

Putting this together, we can define the role of ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the word immediately following it to be repeated three times.",1.0,150,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a repetition of the color that comes directly after it in the input sequence. The number of repetitions seems to be equal to the number of colors that have been introduced in the sequence before ""walm"" shows up. To determine the color that ""walm"" will repeat, look at the word that directly follows ""walm"" and translate it to its corresponding color. If ""walm"" is the last word in the input or no recognizable color word follows it, there is no output.

Let's break it down for each input:

1. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   - ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.
   - ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated.
   - ""wif"" is associated with the color red.
   - Output: blue blue blue red red (three blues for one ""lug"" before ""walm"", and then two reds)

2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   - ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow.
   - ""walm"" causes ""blue"" (from ""lug"") to be repeated.
   - ""wif"" is associated with red.
   - Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red (three yellows for one ""zup"" before ""walm"", and then blue and two reds)

3. Input: zup walm
   - ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow.
   - ""walm"" causes yellow to be repeated three times because one ""zup"" precedes it.
   - Output: yellow yellow yellow

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   - ""wif"" is associated with the color red.
   - ""walm"" causes ""green"" (from ""dax"") to be repeated.
   - ""zup"" translates to yellow.
   - Output: red red red green yellow (three reds for one ""wif"" before ""walm"", and then green and yellow)

5. Input: zup wif walm
   - ""zup"" translates to yellow.
   - ""wif"" translates to red.
   - ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated because it directly follows ""walm"".
   - Output: yellow red red red (one yellow and three reds for ""zup"" and ""wif"" before ""walm"")

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word directly following ""walm"" as many times as there have been unique colors before ""walm"" in the input. If ""walm"" is followed by a word that does not correspond to a color or is the last word, it does not produce any output.",0.9,150,walm
"To figure out the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the given inputs and outputs.

1. The word ""walm"" always results in a repetition of a certain color three times.
2. The color that is repeated three times seems to depend on the word immediately preceding ""walm"".
3. Comparing the input-output pairs:

    - In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output is ""blue blue blue"".
    - In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
    - In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red red red"".

From these examples, we can conclude that ""walm"" causes the next word's color to be repeated three times. The rule for ""walm"" then appears to be that it repeats the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Based on this analysis, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. ""Walm"" causes the color of the word that precedes it to be repeated three times. If the word ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" it outputs ""blue blue blue,"" if ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" it outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and if ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" it outputs ""red red red.""",0.9,150,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm"", let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples:

1. When ""lug walm wif bluf"" is inputted, the output is ""blue blue blue red red"". The only repeating word in the input is ""walm"" and it corresponds to ""blue blue blue"" in the output.

2. When ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" is inputted, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"". Comparing this to the previous example, ""walm"" again corresponds to a threefold repetition of a color, this time ""yellow yellow yellow"".

3. When ""zup walm"" is inputted, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"", which suggests ""walm"" again causes the repetition of ""yellow"" three times.

4. When ""wif walm dax zup"" is inputted, the output is ""red red red green yellow"". Here, ""walm"" is between ""wif"" and ""dax"", and the resultant output for ""walm"" is ""red red red"".

5. When ""zup wif walm"" is inputted, the output is ""yellow red red red"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red red red"".

Using these examples, it seems that ""walm"" transforms the word that precedes it into its corresponding color repeated three times in the output. If there is no word before ""walm"" that can be converted into a color (as seen in examples 3 and 5 where ""zup"" is not directly followed by ""walm""), it defaults to repeating the color associated with ""zup"", which is ""yellow"". Therefore, we can theorize the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it (if there is one) to be repeated three times in the output. If ""walm"" is the first word or if the preceding word does not have an associated color that fits the pattern, it repeats the color associated with ""zup"", which is ""yellow"".

Given this rule induction, the meaning of ""walm"" would be:

walm -> Causing the preceding word's corresponding color to be repeated three times in the output, defaulting to ""yellow"" if there is no preceding color-associated word.",0.8,150,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the common element in the outputs related to each use of ""walm"":

1. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
2. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
3. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
4. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
5. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red

When ""walm"" appears, the word preceding it is repeated three times in the output, with the following exceptions:

- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" not only is ""blue"" repeated three times, but ""red"" is repeated twice.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" we have ""red"" repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" we have ""yellow"" repeated three times.

Looking at these outputs, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. However, when followed by another word (""dax"" or ""lug""), an additional sequence may follow, which seems dependent on the following word and not ""walm"" itself.

To summarize the rule for ""walm"":

From the examples provided, it is evident that whenever the word ""dax"" is present in the input, the word ""green"" is present in the corresponding output.

Therefore, we can deduce that the meaning or rule associated with ""dax"" is that it translates to ""green.""",1.0,151,dax

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word “wif” corresponds to the color “red.” Each time the word “wif” appears, the color “red” is included in the output in the same position. 

Here is the breakdown of the given examples and how they relate to the outputs:

5. Input: zup wif lug dax
   Output: yellow red blue green

From the above observations, we can induce the following rule:

3. The word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
4. The word ""walm"" translates to ""red.""

- In the context of ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" or another ""wif,"" it results in repeated ""red.""

"To identify the meaning of ""bluf,"" we observe its corresponding output in each pair of inputs and outputs. 

- lug wif bluf lug wif -> blue red red blue red
- zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
- dax bluf -> green green
- zup wif dax wif bluf -> yellow red green red red
- dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green

The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" results in the output sandwiching it, repeating the color that immediately follows it. When ""bluf"" is at the end, the color before it is repeated. In the case of being preceded and succeeded by different colors, ""bluf"" repeats the color that comes after it, not the color before.

Thus the rule for ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> meaning: The output color for ""bluf"" is the same as the color of the next word. If ""bluf"" is at the end, it repeats the color of the previous word.

Rule: If bluf is followed by a word, the corresponding color is repeated. If bluf ends the sequence, it takes on the color of the word before it.",1.0,151,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the correlation between the input and the output sequences. Let's look at each pair of input and output:

Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
Output: blue red red blue red

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The appearance of ""bluf"" within the sequence results in the output of a consecutive ""red"" without a corresponding input word.

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

In this example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and the introduction of ""bluf"" results in an additional ""yellow.""

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the presence of ""bluf"" leads to a repetition of ""green.""

Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
Output: yellow red green red red

In this sequence, ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""dax"" with ""green."" Following the introduction of ""bluf,"" the word ""red"" is repeated.

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

Here, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""walm"" is not explicitly linked to a color, but its presence does not disrupt the pattern, and ""wif"" is red. With the introduction of ""bluf,"" the pattern includes a repetition of ""red.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color word that directly follows it:
- In the first example, ""bluf"" precedes ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""red"" is repeated.
- In the second and third examples, there is no word after ""bluf,"" so the color word for ""bluf"" is repeated instead.
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""bluf"" precedes ""dax"" and ""wif,"" respectively, corresponding to ""green"" and ""red,"" and in the output, ""red"" is repeated.

Given these examples, it seems that the rule is that ""bluf"" corresponds to a word that means ""repeat the previous color,"" except when it is at the end of a sequence, in which case it means ""repeat the same color."" However, without more examples, especially with ""bluf"" at different positions in the input, it's challenging to confirm this rule entirely. Further examples with ""bluf"" following different color words would help to refine the rule.

Rule: bluf causes the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes or corresponds to it in the output. If there is no word following ""bluf,"" the color assigned to ""bluf"" itself is repeated.",0.8,151,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the rule that pertains to the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to reflect a pattern where ""bluf"" translates to the color that has been most recently mentioned before it. Here's the analysis to support this rule:

1. In the first input, ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf"", and lug corresponds to ""blue"". ""Bluf"" then gives the output ""red"", which is the color associated with the preceding ""wif"".

2. In the second input, ""bluf"" follows ""zup lug zup"", where ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow"". As per the rule, ""bluf"" should translate to the last mentioned color, which is ""yellow"".

3. In the third input, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""bluf"" follows it, outputting ""green"" once again as per the proposed rule.

4. In the fourth input, the last mentioned colors before ""bluf"" are ""green"" and then ""red"" from ""wif"". Consistent with the rule, ""bluf"" produces an output of ""red"".

5. In the final input, ""bluf"" follows a series of different colors with the immediately preceding color being ""wif"" for ""red"". According to the rule, ""bluf"" results in ""red"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be: bluf outputs the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. 

Rule: bluf -> outputs the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"".",0.8,151,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the pairs of inputs and outputs:

5. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green

Comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs:

- In example 3 (dax bluf), ""dax"" gives ""green"" and ""bluf"" also gives ""green."" However, in all other examples, ""bluf"" does not correspond to ""green,"" suggesting ""bluf"" does not directly translate to ""green.""

- In all examples where ""bluf"" is present, the color after ""bluf"" is always red (unless ""bluf"" is at the end of the input string). Moreover, whenever ""bluf"" appears, it is always followed by the same color as the word that preceded it:
  - Example 1: bluf -> red, and it follows ""wif,"" which corresponds with ""red.""
  - Example 2: bluf -> yellow, and it follows ""zup,"" which corresponds with ""yellow.""
  - Example 4: bluf -> red, and it again follows ""wif,"" which corresponds with ""red.""
  - Example 5: bluf -> red, and it follows ""wif,"" which corresponds with ""red.""

So, it looks like ""bluf"" results in an output that duplicates the color of the word that comes before it. The only outlier is the example where ""bluf"" stands alone with ""dax,"" but this could be a special case or an error.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> the meaning of ""bluf"" is to replicate the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the output. If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" and there are no words following ""bluf,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""green,"" possibly indicating an exception to the rule or a special case when ""bluf"" appears at the end of a string.",0.8,151,bluf
"Rule: Bluf -> Opposite of the color preceding it in the sequence.

Explanation: 
- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and the output color is red, which is the opposite color.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and the output color is yellow, which is the opposite color.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is alone after ""dax"" (green) and the output is green, which is the opposite color.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red) and the output color is red, which is the opposite color.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red) and produces red in the output, again the opposite color.

However, there is a discrepancy in the second example where ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and the output should have been the opposite of yellow, but it is yellow again. Since there is ambiguity in what the opposite of yellow should be and considering all examples as a whole, it seems that ""bluf"" doesn't mean opposite in the conventional sense (as in the color wheel) but rather repeats the color that comes just before it. 

Potential alternative rule given the inconsistency: Bluf -> Repeat the previous color in the sequence.",0.0,151,bluf
"The examples suggest that walm always results in a sequence of ""yellow"" in the output. We can confirm this by analyzing each instance:

1. In the first example, ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"", walm is followed by four ""yellow"" in the output before another color appears.
2. In the second example, ""lug walm"", walm is followed by three ""yellow"" without any other color appearing afterward, as ""lug"" renders ""blue"" before walm is encountered.
3. In the third example, ""zup walm wif"", walm is followed by three ""yellow"" and then ""red"", which corresponds to the word ""wif"" that follows.
4. In the fourth example, ""wif lug walm"", walm is followed by three ""yellow"", and ""lug"" before it gives ""blue"".
5. In the fifth example, ""lug zup walm lug"", walm is again followed by three ""yellow"" and is preceded by ""blue"" and ""yellow"" from ""lug"" and ""zup"" respectively. 

Conclusively, the word ""walm"" seems to produce three instances of ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, we can denote the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: walm -> meaning generates three ""yellow"" colors in the output sequence.",1.0,151,walm
"Analyzing the patterns between the inputs and their corresponding outputs, here is what can be inferred:

- ""wif"" consistently maps to the output ""red.""
- ""lug"" consistently maps to the output ""blue.""
- ""zup"" consistently maps to the output ""yellow.""

It seems that the nonce word ""walm"" does not have a consistent color output like the other words. Instead, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the word before it as many times as the number of letters in the word that precedes it.

Let's confirm this with the examples:

1. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm  
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow  
   The word before the first ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and ""wif"" has three letters. Therefore, ""walm"" outputs ""red"" three times. The word before the second ""walm"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""zup"" has three letters. Therefore, the second ""walm"" outputs ""yellow"" three times.
   
2. Input: lug walm  
   Output: blue blue blue  
   The word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""lug"" has three letters, so ""walm"" outputs ""blue"" three times.
   
3. Input: zup walm wif  
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red  
   The word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""zup"" has three letters, so ""walm"" outputs ""yellow"" three times.
   
4. Input: wif lug walm  
   Output: red blue blue blue  
   The word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""lug"" has three letters, so ""walm"" outputs ""blue"" three times.
   
5. Input: lug zup walm lug  
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue  
   The word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""zup"" has three letters, so ""walm"" outputs ""yellow"" three times.

Thus, we can formulate the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word before it as many times as the number of letters in that word.",1.0,151,walm
"Based on the inputs and outputs provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" correlates with the color word that is repeated multiple times in sequence. Here is the breakdown of how the word ""walm"" behaves in each example:

1. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and when followed by ""walm"", it turns into ""red red red"".
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and when followed by ""walm"", it turns into ""yellow yellow yellow"".

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and when followed by ""walm"", it turns into ""blue blue blue"".

3. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and when followed by ""walm"", it turns into ""yellow yellow yellow"".
   - After ""walm"", the color sequence resets with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"".

4. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", then followed by ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"".
   - ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".

5. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", followed by ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", and then the sequence resets with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"".

Considering these examples, ""walm"" seems to amplify the most recent color word prior to it, repeating it a total of three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the most recent color word to be repeated three times.",0.9,151,walm
"Observing the examples provided where 'walm' is present and its corresponding outputs in color:

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

The outputs for each 'walm' instance are as follows:

- In the first example: red red yellow yellow
- In the second example: blue blue blue
- In the third example: yellow yellow red
- In the fourth example: blue blue blue
- In the fifth example: yellow yellow blue

The outputs for words other than 'walm' consistently map to a specific color:

- 'wif' consistently maps to red.
- 'lug' consistently maps to blue.
- 'zup' consistently maps to yellow.

It is noticeable that 'walm' comes after a color has been repeated once or twice and seems to continue the pattern of that color, before potentially switching to another color based on the following word (as in the first example).

Based on these observations, 'walm' could mean 'repeat the last color pattern'. However, if we only have one previous color, 'walm' does not provide a clear rule (as in the second and fourth examples where it's just repeating blue). So it seems 'walm' behaves differently depending on the context:

When following a word like 'wif' (red) or 'zup' (yellow), 'walm' repeats the color pattern that was established.

When following 'lug' (blue), 'walm' repeats the color blue, even if there was no pattern established before it, indicating a possible default behavior. 

Thus, the word 'walm' seems to mean repeat the last color if there was a pattern, otherwise repeat the color of the word before 'walm':

Rule: walm -> If a color pattern of at least two colors is established, repeat that pattern. If not, repeat the color of the word before 'walm'.",0.8,151,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I'll analyze the pattern of output colors relative to the placement of ""walm"" and other words in the input.

Looking at the inputs and corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" generates one ""red""
   - ""walm"" that follows ""wif"" generates two additional ""red"" plus the next word's color (which is ""yellow"" for ""zup"")
   - The second ""walm"" generates one ""yellow"" corresponding to the word before it (""zup"") plus the next word's color (which is ""yellow"" for ""zup"")

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" generates one ""blue""
   - ""walm"" that follows ""lug"" generates two additional ""blue""

3. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""zup"" generates one ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" that follows ""zup"" generates two additional ""yellow"" plus the next word's color (which is ""red"" for ""wif"")

4. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   - ""wif"" generates one ""red""
   - ""lug"" generates one ""blue""
   - ""walm"" that follows ""lug"" generates two additional ""blue""

5. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""lug"" generates one ""blue""
   - ""zup"" generates one ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" that follows ""zup"" generates two additional ""yellow"" plus the next word's color (in this case, another ""yellow"" for the second ""lug"")

From these examples, we see the following pattern related to ""walm"":
- ""walm"" generates two additional colors that are the same as the word that immediately precedes it.
- Additionally, if there's a word following ""walm,"" it also generates the color corresponding to that word.

Based on the above observations, ""walm"" seems to follow this rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> duplicates the color of the word before it resulting in two additional instances of that color, and if there is a word following ""walm,"" it adds one instance of the corresponding color of the next word. If there's no word following ""walm,"" there's no additional color added beyond the duplication of the previous word's color.

Please note that on the first and fifth examples, the duplication seems to contradict the general rule, as it produces an additional color based on the word following ""walm"" even though it is not the immediate next word. However, with the given data, I have identified the closest consistent rule regarding the position of ""walm"" and its relation to surrounding words.

Looking at the outputs, ""walm"" always corresponds to ""red"", except when followed by ""lug"" where it's followed by ""green"". This might mean ""walm"" corresponds to a color, but its output depends on the word that comes after ""walm"". If ""lug"" comes after ""walm,"" it changes the color to ""green"" instead of ""red"".

So we can establish a preliminary rule:

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the given examples, let's analyze the patterns:

1. Input: dax walm lug | Output: green green green blue
   - Here, ""dax"" leads to ""green"" and the last ""lug"" leads to ""blue"". Given the repetition, it suggests that ""walm"" has a similar function as ""dax"" but there may be a factor that modifies or extends the output.

2. Input: wif walm | Output: red red red
   - ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" seems to add repetitions of the color associated with ""wif"".

3. Input: lug wif zup wif walm | Output: blue red yellow red red red
   - ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output is multiple ""red"". This supports the idea that ""walm"" induces repetition of the previous color.

4. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug | Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   - Following the established meanings, ""bluf"" corresponds to an additional ""blue,"" then we have ""red"" from ""wif,"" followed by ""blue"" from ""lug,"" then ""red"" again from ""wif.""

Based on these examples, ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color that corresponds to the previously mentioned word. Specifically, it seems to repeat the color of the word right before it. We can see that after ""walm,"" the output color matches the color that corresponds to the word that appears just before ""walm"":

- In example 1, the word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""green"" repeated thrice.

- When ""lug"" precedes ""wif"", ""lug"" outputs ""blue"" and ""wif"" follows with ""red"": ""blue red""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", ""bluf"" outputs another ""red"".

The rule for ""wif"" seems to be two-fold: it outputs ""red"" and it causes the preceding word to output its corresponding color. For example, ""dax"" always translates to ""green"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", regardless of the presence of ""wif"". The word following ""wif"" either has its own rule (""bluf"" to ""red""), or in the absence of a word following ""wif"", there's no additional output.

Rule: ""wif"" outputs ""red"" and ensures the word before it outputs its corresponding color. If there is a word following ""wif"", that word's color is determined by its own rule. If no word follows ""wif"", there is no further output. 

wif -> red",1.0,153,wif
"After analyzing the provided examples, here is the rule I have induced:

1. The words ""zup,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" correlate with the colors ""yellow,"" ""green,"" and ""blue,"" respectively.
2. Whenever the word ""wif"" is present, it appears to result in the color ""red.""
3. Additionally, ""wif"" seems to cause the color associated with the word that comes before it to be repeated in the output (except in the case of ""dax wif,"" which produces ""green red"" without repeating ""green"").

Based on these observations, we can establish the following rule for ""wif"":

Rule: When ""wif"" appears after a word that corresponds to a color, the output is the color associated with the word followed by ""red."" If the word that comes before ""wif"" is ""dax"", there is no repetition, only ""red"" is the output.

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" can be defined as:

wif -> Repeat the previous color in the output (except after ""dax"") and append ""red.""",0.8,153,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow.""",1.0,153,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow' regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,153,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".",1.0,153,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Each instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,153,zup
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the meaning of zup appears to be:

zup -> yellow

Each time the word 'zup' appears in the input, it corresponds to 'yellow' in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup means yellow.",1.0,153,zup
"Observing the input and output pairs, the word bluf seems to consistently lead to the output ""blue blue"" regardless of the words that come before or after it. This indicates that bluf directly translates to ""blue blue"". Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> ""blue blue""",1.0,153,bluf
"bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" always corresponds to the color blue in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,153,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> ""blue"" if the word before bluf is ""lug"", otherwise ""red"".",1.0,153,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> blue when preceding or following the words corresponding to blue, otherwise red.",1.0,153,bluf
"Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color represented by the word that immediately precedes it. 

For instance:
- In ""zup lug bluf"" (yellow blue blue), ""bluf"" takes the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.
- In ""wif bluf"" (red red), ""bluf"" assumes the color of ""wif,"" which is red.
- And so on for each example, with ""bluf"" adopting the color of the word right before it.",1.0,153,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" seems to depend on the word that appears immediately before it. Here is the pattern observed:

1. When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red.""
2. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
3. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red.""
4. When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Thus, it appears that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before it three times. Using this pattern, we can create the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,153,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the output strings for each input example that contains the word ""walm.""

1. Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red
2. Input: lug wif dax zup walm -> Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
3. Input: lug walm zup wif -> Output: blue blue blue yellow red
4. Input: dax lug wif walm -> Output: green blue red red red
5. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

From these examples, we notice that ""walm"" changes its output based on the word that comes before it. Specifically, the output for ""walm"" is three repetitions of the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm."" 

To verify this, let's check each example:

1. ""wif"" -> red, thus ""walm"" after ""wif"" results in ""red red red.""
2. ""zup"" -> yellow, thus ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
3. ""lug"" -> blue, thus ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue blue blue.""
4. ""wif"" -> red (pattern repeats), thus ""walm"" after ""wif"" again results in ""red red red.""
5. ""zup"" -> yellow (pattern repeats), thus ""walm"" after ""zup"" again results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""walm"" means repeating the color output associated with the preceding word thrice.

Hence, ""walm"" refers to a repetition of a certain color output, depending on the word that comes before it.",1.0,153,walm
"Based on the input and output examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" affects the output in the following way:

1. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"". The color ""red"" is repeated three times.
2. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" results in ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"". After the standard color outputs for ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax,"" ""zup"" is followed by three repetitions of ""yellow,"" implying ""walm"" may cause the color preceding it to repeat three times.
3. ""lug walm zup wif"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow red"". Here ""lug"" is repeated thrice as ""blue,"" before moving on to ""zup"" and ""wif"" with their individual colors. Again, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word before it, which in this case is ""lug,"" three times.
4. ""dax lug wif walm"" results in ""green blue red red red"". ""Walm"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" three times.
5. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"". The word ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" three times.

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" causes the output color of the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three more times.

Walm -> meaning: When following another word, ""walm"" repeats the output color of the preceding word three additional times.",1.0,153,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided. The pattern in the output seems to be related to the colors, and how many times they are repeated. Let's analyze:

1. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - The word ""wif"" translates to a single ""red,"" while ""walm"" seems to repeat this color three times.

2. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   - Here, ""lug"" becomes ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" ""Walm"" at the end produces three ""yellow"" colors, repeating the color associated with the word just before it (""zup"").

3. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output is three ""blue,"" which suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word it directly follows three times.

4. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   - Following the same logic, ""walm"" is repeating the color ""red"" from ""wif"" three times.

5. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - Here, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" three times.

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: Walm repeats the color of the word directly before it three times.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: the meaning of walm is to repeat the color associated with the previous word in the sequence three times.",1.0,153,walm
"Analyzing the provided input-output pairs, we can infer a pattern that defines the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Let's examine the correspondence between the input and output in each example:

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

For the single word ""wif"" before ""walm,"" we have two repetitions of ""red"" for ""walm.""

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

Here we have four words before ""walm,"" and ""walm"" produces three ""yellow"" following the pattern of the word ""zup.""

Input: lug walm zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow red

In this case, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" which results in two additional repetitions of ""blue"" for ""walm."" Then it continues normally with ""zup"" as ""yellow"" and ""wif"" as ""red.""

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red

Following a similar pattern, ""wif"" is replicated twice as ""red"" for ""walm.""

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""walm"" creates three repetitions of ""yellow"" matching the pattern for ""zup.""

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" takes the color corresponding to the last color word before it and repeats it a number of times. The number of repetitions is consistent with the number of syllables in the color associated with the last word before ""walm."" For example, ""red"" has one syllable, and thus ""walm"" following ""wif"" (red) results in it being repeated two times (for a total of three ""red,"" including the one from ""wif""). Similarly, ""yellow"" has two syllables, and following ""zup"" (yellow) results in it being repeated three times, leading to four occurrences including the initial ""yellow.""

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the last color word before it, with the number of repetitions equal to the number of syllables in that color word.",0.9,153,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: dax -> green,1.0,154,dax

"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,154,dax
"Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,154,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can analyze the relationship between the input and the output to deduce the meaning of ""wif"".

In every example where ""wif"" appears, ""red"" is consistently the first color in the output, regardless of its position in the input. This indicates that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".

Here is the breakdown:

1. Input: lug walm zup wif 
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""lug"", ""walm"", and ""zup"" correlate to ""blue"", ""blue"", and ""yellow"", respectively, followed by ""red"" for ""wif"".

2. Input: lug zup wif
   Output: blue yellow red
   - ""lug"" and ""zup"" correlate to ""blue"" and ""yellow"", respectively, followed by ""red"" for ""wif"".

3. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow
   - The output starts with ""red"", which corresponds to ""wif"", followed by ""yellow"" for ""zup"".

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow"", followed by ""red"" for ""wif"" and repeated ""red"" for ""walm"".

5. Input: wif
   Output: red
   - Only ""wif"" is present, and the output is solely ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,154,wif
"From the provided examples, we can determine that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the same position in the output. Therefore, the rule seems to be as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,154,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at each example and analyze the pattern:

- In the first example, the output for ""lug walm zup wif"" is ""blue blue blue yellow red,"" while for ""lug zup wif"", it's ""blue yellow red"". Here, removing ""walm"" from the sequence removed a ""blue"" from the output. This hints that ""walm"" might correspond to the color ""blue"". Also, after removing ""walm,"" the sequence still ends with ""wif,"" and the output still ends with ""yellow red.""

- In the third example, ""wif zup"" leads to an output of ""red yellow,"" suggesting that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and that ""wif"" may correspond to ""red.""

- The fourth example also supports this as ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red,"" again suggesting ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" as ""red.""

- Finally, the fifth example is just ""wif,"" and the output is simply ""red.""

Based on the patterns observed in these examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red

Each occurrence of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output.",1.0,154,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" To support this, we can observe that in every instance where ""wif"" appears, ""red"" also appears in the output.

Therefore:

wif -> meaning. Meaning: red

"From the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Every example containing ""wif"" corresponds with ""red"" in the output.

- Whenever ""zup"" appears by itself or in a sequence, the output is always ""yellow.""

"Based on the examples given, it appears that 'bluf' doubles the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. Here is the breakdown according to the examples:

- zup corresponds to yellow, so ""zup bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow"".
- dax corresponds to green (deduced from the third example), so ""dax zup bluf"" becomes ""green yellow yellow"" due to the presence of 'zup bluf' immediately after 'dax'.

"Based on the examples given, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond to a color. However, this color is not consistent across all examples, which suggests that ""walm"" does not represent a fixed color each time but rather depends on some aspect of the context it's used in.

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" is ""blue"" when it follows ""lug.""

- ""Dax"" is not influenced by the words around it, as it consistently translates to ""green,"" whether it comes before or after other words (e.g., ""lug dax"" or ""dax lug walm"").

- ""wif"" appears after ""zup"" (example 4 and 5), and ""red"" follows ""yellow"" in the output.

No matter the position of ""wif"" in the input, ""red"" consistently appears in the same position in the output. Therefore, it can be deduced that ""wif"" correlates directly to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,155,wif
"From the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" is a conditional operation that affects the output color based on the colors or words preceding it. To deduce its meaning, we can analyze the patterns where ""wif"" is used:

1. In the first example, we have ""dax wif lug dax"" mapping to ""green red blue green"". The word ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" so we can infer that somehow ""wif"" takes the color that ""lug"" corresponds to and changes it.

2. In the second example, ""zup walm lug wif"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow blue red"". Here, ""wif"" comes after ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" and the output is ""red."" This suggests that when ""wif"" follows ""lug,"" it changes ""blue"" to ""red.""

3. In the third example, ""dax walm wif dax"" turns into ""green green green red green."" When ""wif"" is between two ""dax"" (green), it changes the output to ""red,"" indicating that perhaps ""wif"" causes a change based on a repetition of the same color.

4. The fourth example of ""zup wif zup"" results in ""yellow red yellow,"" which shows that ""wif"" between two identical words (""zup"") maps to ""red.""

5. Finally, in ""zup wif bluf,"" the resulting output is ""yellow red red,"" which suggests that ""wif"" produces a ""red"" regardless of following a different word or color.

From these observations, we can infer that ""wif"" likely translates to the color ""red"" when it follows certain conditions – perhaps when the preceding color is either blue or the same color repeats before and after ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be that it produces the output ""red"" when:

1. It comes after the word that yields ""blue"" (e.g., ""lug"").
2. It is surrounded by the same color (e.g., ""dax [...] dax"" or ""zup [...] zup"").
3. It precedes a word translating to a different color (e.g., ""bluf"").

However, given the limited number of examples, this rule might not entirely cover all possible uses of ""wif;"" it is the best deduction based on the available information. Additional examples could help solidify or refute this rule.

Rule: wif -> changes the output to ""red"" under certain conditions such as following blue or being between identical colors.",0.8,155,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to look at the way it modifies the sequences in which it appears. Let's go through the examples:

1. dax wif lug dax → green red blue green
2. zup walm lug wif → yellow yellow yellow blue red
3. dax walm wif dax → green green green red green
4. zup wif zup → yellow red yellow
5. zup wif bluf → yellow red red

Analyzing the examples:

- In the first example, the presence of ""wif"" between ""lug"" and ""dax"" converts ""lug"" from blue to red. However, this change could either be specific to the context of ""lug,"" or due to ""wif.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" appears at the end and is followed by red in the output, but there is not an exact word before ""wif"" to compare this change to, as in the first example.
- In the third example, similar to the first, the presence of ""wif"" could be the reason why ""dax"" is outputting red instead of green. This adds to the evidence that ""wif"" may change the preceding color to red.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" causes the word ""zup"", which normally corresponds to yellow, to be output as red when it appears directly after ""wif.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" seems to turn ""bluf"" into red, whereas without more information, we might expect ""bluf"" to correspond to blue or some other color.

So, while there is not an abundance of data, the consistent pattern appears to be that when ""wif"" immediately precedes another word, the output color for that word is red, regardless of what the word generally maps to. There is not enough consistent data to determine what happens when ""wif"" is at the end of a sequence or what its own corresponding color might be.

Rule: when ""wif"" is immediately followed by another word, that word is translated to the color red in the output.

wif -> meaning: ""wif,"" when preceding another word, changes the output color for that word to red.",0.8,155,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" appears to consistently translate to the color ""yellow."" 

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow.",1.0,155,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each non-nonce word (i.e., ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" and ""walm"") is associated with a specific color:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- bluf -> green
- walm -> yellow

The nonce word ""zup"" seems consistently associated with the color yellow regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.",1.0,155,zup
"Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,155,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position or the context within the given examples.",1.0,155,zup
"Based on the examples provided and the associated outputs, each input word appears to correspond to a specific color in the output. This includes the nonce word ""zup,"" which consistently translates to the same color in the output across all examples. Here is the correspondence between the input words and their colors based on the given examples:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- bluf -> green (note that ""bluf"" translated to ""green"" instead of ""red"" in the last example, which might indicate there's a typo in the second example or that context can change the color it represents)
- walm -> yellow
- zup -> yellow

From the given data, we can determine the following rule for the nonce word ""zup"":

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,155,zup
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond with the output of a color repeated once. However, the color repeated is not consistent across examples but is dependent on the preceding word. 

- In example one, ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red.""
- In example two and three, ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green.""
- In example four, ""bluf"" after ""zup"" results in ""yellow yellow"" (assuming ""dax"" keeps its ""green"" output consistent).
- In example five, ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue.""

The pattern suggests that the output color is determined by the word immediately before ""bluf"", and the output color is repeated twice. Without explicit information on what color each word corresponds to (except for the given examples), the best we can determine is that:

Rule: bluf -> The color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf,"" repeated twice.",1.0,155,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce that 'bluf' repeats the color associated with the word just before it, in the output, two times. Here’s how this plays out in each example:

- In the first input, 'wif' precedes 'bluf' and 'wif' corresponds to 'green'. Therefore, 'bluf' results in 'green green'.
- In the second and the third inputs, 'dax' is followed by 'bluf'. 'Dax' corresponds to 'green', and this is again replicated two times.
- The fourth input sees 'dax' followed by 'bluf', and since 'dax' corresponds to 'green', 'bluf' leads to 'green green' in the output.
- Finally, in the last input, 'lug' precedes 'bluf'. 'Lug' corresponds to 'blue', thus 'bluf' returns 'blue blue'.

Here's the rule:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. 'Bluf' duplicates the color output associated with the word just before it, and this color output is shown twice.",1.0,155,bluf
"To determine the meaning or the rule behind the word ""bluf"" based on the given examples, let's first analyze the color outputs in relation with the presence of the term 'bluf'.

1. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
2. dax bluf -> green green
3. dax bluf -> green green
4. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
5. wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue

Observing the relationships:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""
- ""Bluf"" following three words in example 1 and 5, the latter being ""wif walm lug bluf,"" leads to the last two colors being the same, which deviates from the precedent set by the first colors.
- In example 4, ""bluf"" is preceded by a different word, ""zup,"" and the color after ""bluf"" is ""green,"" which is the same color associated with ""dax.""

Given these observations, we can propose the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word.

Explanation: In each instance, the output color following the word ""bluf"" matches the output color of the word that precedes it. When ""bluf"" is paired with ""dax,"" the output is ""green,"" which is also the output color of ""dax."" When placed after ""lug,"" a word not previously specified, the color ""blue"" appears twice in succession, which suggests ""bluf"" could be taking on the color associated with ""lug,"" despite not knowing what color ""lug"" originally represents.

Thus, the rule induction suggests:
bluf -> meaning. The word ""bluf"" causes the preceding word's color to be repeated in the output.",0.8,155,bluf
"Based on the examples given, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" can be deduced by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Each output consists of color names that seem to correlate with the words in the input. The occurence of ""bluf"" in the input is always matched with either the red or blue color in the output, suggesting a color association. It's essential to look at the position of ""bluf"" and what colors precede its output to understand its meaning.

Given observations:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax walm wif"", the output is two reds, suggesting that ""bluf"" may involve the color red in this context.
2. When ""bluf"" follows just ""dax"", the output is two greens, and ""bluf"" does not seem to affect the color output.
3. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output for ""bluf"" is green.
4. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif walm lug"", the output for ""bluf"" is two blues, suggesting that ""bluf"" may involve blue in this context.

From these observations, we can infer a pattern:

- ""bluf"" following ""walm wif"" (4th example) results in ""blue blue"", which suggests that ""bluf"" takes on a blue meaning when paired with these specific words. 
- ""bluf"" following ""dax walm wif"" (1st example) results in ""red red,"" which suggests that an additional preceding word (""dax"") might cause ""bluf"" to change its associated color to red.
- When ""bluf"" follows a single word (""dax"" or ""zup""), it does not seem to change its color, and the corresponding color (""green"" or ""yellow"") seems to be associated with the preceding word, not ""bluf"".

Given these points, ""bluf"" could be considered a word that changes color based on the context or the words it follows. If we must simplify this into a rule:

bluf -> meaning: A context-dependent indicator of color, being red when following a sequence of specific words (""dax walm wif""), blue when following another sequence (""wif walm lug""), and having no color effect when following single words (""dax"" or ""zup""), with the color being determined by the preceding word instead.

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" changes based on the words that come before it, indicating red in some contexts and blue in others, without affecting the output when following single words.",0.8,155,bluf
"Given the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce a possible rule by comparing the inputs and the corresponding outputs. Each input line contains the word ""bluf"" and produces an output with either one or two colors. The repetition of ""dax bluf"" and its consistent output of ""green green,"" along with varying positions and combinations of other words, suggests that ""bluf"" could be affecting the color output in a specific way.

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue

Considering the above examples, a potential rule for ""bluf"" might be that it causes the previous one or two words to be repeated in the output with specific colors. Looking closely:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which yields green, it results in ""green green.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif walm,"" where ""wif"" yields red and ""walm"" also yields red, it results in ""red red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which yields blue, it results in ""blue blue.""
- And when ""bluf"" is between ""zup"" and ""dax,"" it doesn't repeat any previous color, which suggests that the repetition rule is possibly linked to its position after the words whose associated colors are to be repeated.

These observations indicate the following possible rule:

bluf -> The meaning seems to be that when ""bluf"" follows other words, it causes the last word's color to be repeated. If there are two or more words before ""bluf"" that yield the same color, ""bluf"" causes the color of the last two words to be repeated. If the words before ""bluf"" yield different colors, only the last color is repeated. 

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows one or more words, repeat the color(s) associated with the word(s) immediately preceding ""bluf."" If the colors are the same, repeat the color twice; if not, repeat only the last color.",0.8,155,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to examine the input and output pairs to see if there's a consistent pattern associated with each occurrence of ""walm."" Here is the analysis:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup | Output: red red red green yellow
   ""wif"" and ""dax"" both translate to ""red"" and ""green"" when not directly associated with ""walm."" ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup walm | Output: yellow yellow yellow
   ""Zup"" by itself is ""yellow,"" but the presence of ""walm"" turns the following word into ""yellow"" too.

3. Input: dax walm zup lug dax | Output: green green green yellow blue green
   ""Dax"" on its own is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" ""Walm"" is followed by repeating the color of the preceding word.

4. Input: wif lug walm | Output: red blue blue blue
   ""Wif"" by itself is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes the following word to repeat the ""blue"" color.

5. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf | Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   ""Zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" seems like a duplication of ""red."" ""Walm"" in this case replicates the ""yellow"" color of ""zup.""

Rule: It appears that ""walm"" causes the following word(s) to take on the color of the word directly preceding ""walm.""

Walm -> meaning: Causes the following word(s) to replicate the color of the word immediately before ""walm"".",1.0,155,walm
"Rule: ""walm"" -> ""copy the color of the previous word.""

Explanation:

1. When the input ""wif walm dax zup"" is given, the output is ""red red red green yellow."" Here, walm has the same color as the previous word, wif, which is red.

2. In the case of ""zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" Thus, walm takes on the color of zup, which is yellow.

3. For ""dax walm zup lug dax,"" the output sequence is ""green green green yellow blue green."" Walm again has the same color as the previous word, dax, making the output for walm green.

4. With the input ""wif lug walm,"" the resulting output is ""red blue blue blue."" This shows that walm is copying the color of lug, which is blue.

5. Finally, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" Walm once again has the same color as the previous word, zup, so the color output for walm is yellow.

Hence, the pattern indicates that the word ""walm"" takes the color of the word that precedes it.",1.0,155,walm
"From examining the examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""walm."" Let's look at the patterns:

1. After ""wif walm"" in the input, the output is a sequence of ""red red.""
2. After just ""walm"" with a previous word ""zup,"" the output is a sequence of ""yellow yellow.""
3. After ""dax walm,"" the output sequence starts with ""green green.""
4. After ""wif lug walm,"" the output sequence is ""blue blue blue.""
5. After ""zup walm lug,"" the output sequence is ""yellow blue.""

Given this information, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the following word's associated color to repeat one additional time. To be more specific:

- If the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is red, then ""walm"" causes the output to be ""red red.""
- If the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is yellow, then ""walm"" causes the output to be ""yellow yellow.""
- If the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is green, then ""walm"" causes the output to be ""green green.""
- If the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is blue, then ""walm"" causes the output to be ""blue blue.""

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated once in the output sequence.",0.8,155,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" affects the color output associated with the words following it, up until a new word supersedes its effect. Specifically, ""walm"" appears to cause all subsequent words to output the same color ""blue,"" until a different nonce word with its own color effect appears.

Here are the observations supporting this:

1. In the first example, the output is ""red red red"" before ""walm,"" and after ""walm,"" we have ""green yellow,"" but the first ""green"" might still be following the pattern from ""dax,"" so the effect of ""walm"" in this case is ""yellow.""

2. In the second example, all outputs are ""yellow"" after ""walm"" with no new nonce word to potentially change the color effect.

3. In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax,"" where all outputs turn ""green"" until ""lug"" changes it. This means that ""lug"" supersedes ""walm's"" effect and has its own output of ""blue,"" and ""dax"" goes back to ""green.""

4. In the fourth example, after ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" is output consecutively which shows ""walm's"" effect clearly.

5. Lastly, in the fifth example, after ""walm,"" the color is ""blue"" until a new nonce word, ""wif,"" appears and changes the output to ""red red.""

Taking into account that ""walm"" doesn't change the color to ""blue"" in the first example where it is followed by ""green yellow,"" it is possible that ""walm"" does not change already defined color outputs but ensures that any undefined or subsequent words will turn to ""blue"" until a new color rule takes effect.

Rule: walm -> initiates or continues the output of the color ""blue"" for undefined or subsequent words until a new nonce word with a predefined color effect appears.",0.8,155,walm
"To figure out the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will look for patterns in the input and corresponding output across the examples provided.

- In the first example, the word ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" and the output is ""red red red green."" Here, the word ""walm"" correlates to multiple ""red"" outputs, stopping before ""green"" which corresponds to ""dax.""

- In the second example, ""walm"" is the second word and is followed by no other words except for ""zup"" which is known. The output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" once again correlates to a series of ""yellow"" that is as long as the number of words following ""zup.""

- In the third example, ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" and is followed by ""zup."" The corresponding output is green for ""dax,"" followed by repeating ""green"" for ""walm,"" and then yellow for ""zup."" This reinforces the idea that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately following it.

- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by no words, and the output is a series of ""blue,"" which corresponds to ""lug."" This is consistent with the rule that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the following word.

- In the fifth example, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" and before ""lug"" and ""wif,"" with the output being a repeated series of ""yellow,"" which is associated with ""zup.""

Based on these observations, we can derive the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in a sequence, the color of the output corresponding to the next specified word in the sequence repeats for as many times as there are words including and following ""walm"" until the color changes due to a different word with a specified color.

- ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" translates to ""red red green green red red blue red,"" where ""red"" for ""wif"" is repeated after ""walm.""
- In ""zup walm dax lug"", ""yellow"" for ""zup"" is repeated after ""walm.""
- ""wif walm dax"" becomes ""red red red green,"" again repeating ""red"" after ""walm.""
- ""dax wif walm lug zup"" leads to ""green red red red blue yellow"" with ""red"" for ""wif"" repeated.
- Finally, ""dax wif walm"" results in ""green red red red,"" showing the repetition once more.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat once.",1.0,156,walm
"The examples show sequences of nonce words mapped to colors. The output colors correspond to the input nonce words except when the word ""walm"" appears. 

When we examine the instances of ""walm"", we see that it is consistently followed by a color: ""walm lug"" corresponds to ""red blue"", ""walm dax"" corresponds to ""red green"", and just ""walm"" with no noun following corresponds to a sequence of ""red"".

This suggests that ""walm"" in the context of these examples translates to ""red"" consistently, regardless of whether it is followed by another nonce word or not.

Rule:

walm -> red",1.0,156,walm
"Given the examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to relate to the word ""wif"" that appears before it. Analyzing the patterns:

1. When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"", the corresponding output colors for ""wif walm"" are ""red red red"". Without ""walm"", ""wif"" correlates with ""red"".

2. The presence of ""walm"" after ""wif"" adds an additional ""red"" to the sequence, hence increasing the count of ""red"" outputs by one more than the usual count associated with ""wif"".

3. ""walm"" doesn't seem to contribute a new color or change the pattern of any other colors. It specifically affects the color output following ""wif"" by adding an extra ""red"".

In essence, the rule observed from the given examples is:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", the output for ""wif"" will have an additional ""red"" than it usually would.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to a color. To deduce the specific rule for ""bluf,"" let us look at the context in which it appears:

- In the first two examples, ""bluf"" is associated with contrasting colors when combined with ""dax"" and ""wif."" ""Dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" When ""bluf"" is used with ""dax,"" it generates an additional ""green,"" and with ""wif,"" an additional ""red.""

- In the third example, ""bluf"" is used with ""dax"" only, and the output is double ""green,"" which is consistent with the outcome of the first example.

- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" appears between ""wif"" and ""lug dax wif."" The output following ""bluf"" is ""blue green red,"" which doesn't seem to have a straightforward pattern that directly converts ""bluf"" to a specific color. However, the ""red"" corresponds to the ""wif"" that follows and ""green"" corresponds to ""dax.""

- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" appears after ""walm wif"" and the output colors following ""bluf"" are ""red red,"" which correspond with the translation of ""wif.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" could mean ""repeat,"" specifically repeating the color associated with the following word. Let's put this rule to the test:

Rule:
bluf -> repeat the color associated with the next word (essentially a duplication of the color associated with the word that follows ""bluf"").

For the given examples, this would mean:
- ""dax bluf wif"" results in green (from ""dax""), green (repeat ""dax"" because of ""bluf""), red (from ""wif"").
- ""wif bluf dax"" results in red (from ""wif""), red (repeat ""wif"" because of ""bluf""), green (from ""dax"").
- ""dax bluf"" results in green (from ""dax""), green (repeat ""dax"" because of ""bluf"").
- ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" results in red (from ""wif""), red (repeat ""wif"" because of ""bluf""), with ""lug"" being a separate context not defined by the examples, then green (from ""dax""), red (from ""wif"").
- ""dax walm wif bluf"" results in green (from ""dax""), green (from ""walm"" - assuming ""walm"" translates to green as well), red (from ""wif""), red (repeat ""wif"" because of ""bluf"").",1.0,157,bluf
"To infer the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at the position of ""bluf"" relative to other words and the corresponding output colors. Let's look at the patterns:

1. When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", the color that follows is green (see first and third examples).
2. When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", the color that follows is red (see the second and fourth examples).
3. The output color for ""bluf"" is unaffected by words that follow it, as seen in the first three examples where there's no word after ""bluf"" but still a color is assigned.
4. When multiple words are present, the sequence of colors matches the sequence of words before ""bluf"", without interference from words that come after ""bluf"" (see the fifth example, ""dax walm wif bluf"" leads to ""green green green red red"").

Based on these observations, it seems like ""bluf"" itself does not have a color output associated with it but rather causes the previously mentioned items to generate their corresponding color a second time in the sequence. Therefore, ""bluf"" could be understood as a rule to ""repeat the color outputs of the preceding words."" 

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color outputs of the preceding words.",1.0,157,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> switch the upcoming color pattern.

The outputs appear to be based on a color pattern that changes when the word ""bluf"" is encountered. Before ""bluf"" appears, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". After ""bluf,"" the color assignments switch: ""dax"" becomes ""red"" and ""wif"" becomes ""green,"" with any additional words like ""lug"" being assigned ""blue."" The pattern reset does not carry over to subsequent sentences; it only applies within the same sentence.",1.0,157,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the output seems to have a color associated with each word, and the order of the words affects the sequence of the colors. The word ""bluf"" is always associated with red when it is placed after other words. The color does not change regardless of its position among other words.

So, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> red

Meaning that the word ""bluf"" always corresponds to the color red.",1.0,157,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the examples provided:

- When an item comes before ""bluf,"" the corresponding output color is ""green"" if the item is ""dax"" and ""red"" if the item is ""wif.""
- When an item comes after ""bluf,"" the color is ""red"" if the item is ""dax"" and ""red"" if the item is ""wif.""
- If no item comes after ""bluf,"" no color is assigned.

Considering the patterns, it seems that the word ""bluf"" serves as a turning point where the color of ""dax"" changes from green before ""bluf"" to red after ""bluf,"" whereas ""wif"" always corresponds to red regardless of its position relative to ""bluf."" The word ""lug"" yields the color blue, which does not directly affect the rule for ""bluf"" but is additional information about color assignment.

Rule: ""bluf"" changes the output color for ""dax"" from green to red if ""dax"" is after ""bluf,"" but does not affect the color assignment for ""wif,"" which is always red.",0.9,157,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine how it is used in the different examples and the corresponding outputs.

Here are the noticeable patterns:

1. When ""zup walm"" occurs, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" by itself in another example (""wif walm dax zup"") also leads to ""yellow,"" but when combined with ""walm,"" the output for ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

2. A similar pattern occurs with ""lug wif walm,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" seems to cause the repetition of the word ""red"" three times instead of once.

3. With ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" is translated to ""green,"" and with ""walm"" following it, the output is ""green"" repeated three times again.

4. ""Lug walm wif lug"" outputs ""blue blue blue red blue."" ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" (""blue"") and proceeds to repeat it twice more, and ""wif"" after ""walm"" corresponds to ""red.""

The repeating pattern indicates that ""walm"" causes the color word before it to be repeated three times in the output. Therefore, ""walm"" works as a repeater for the preceding color descriptor.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color word directly preceding it to be repeated three times in the output.",1.0,157,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each instance where the word appears and the output it produces:

- In the first example, ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow."" Zup is likely to correspond to yellow.
- In the second example, ""lug wif walm"" produces ""blue red red red."" This suggests that ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""wif"" to red, while the output for ""walm"" has three of the colors that follow it. 
- In the third example, ""wif walm dax zup"" outputs ""red red red green yellow."" If we take ""wif"" as red and ""zup"" as yellow with ""dax"" being green, we see that ""walm"" is followed by three repeated instances of the color of the word immediately after ""walm.""
- The fourth example contains ""lug walm wif lug"" generating ""blue blue blue red blue,"" confirming further that ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" prompts three repeated colors corresponding to the next word.
- Finally, ""dax walm"" gives ""green green green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" means green and ""walm"" generates three greens, consistent with the previous pattern.

Based on the pattern observed in the outputs, it appears that ""walm"" acts as a command that outputs the next word's corresponding color three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the following word three times.",1.0,157,walm
"Analyzing the patterns:

- When ""zup"" is present, ""yellow"" is included in the output.
- When ""lug"" is present, ""blue"" appears in the output.
- When ""wif"" is present, ""red"" shows up in the output.
- When ""dax"" is present, ""green"" is used in the output.

When ""walm"" is present in the input, the corresponding output has three of the same color that would otherwise be associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" This repetition of color does not occur with words not followed by ""walm.""

Here's how ""walm"" interacts with the preceding word:

- After ""zup,"" we get ""yellow yellow yellow"" (three yellows).
- After ""lug,"" we get ""blue blue blue"" (three blues).
- After ""wif,"" we get ""red red red"" (three reds).
- After ""dax,"" we get ""green green green"" (three greens).
- ""walm"" itself, without a preceding color word, is not associated with an output color (no independent examples were provided).

Given this information, ""walm"" seems to triple the color associated with the word that comes directly before it.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeats the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,157,walm
"Given the examples provided, let's try to deduce the meaning of ""walm"":

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

From the given input-output pairs, we observe the following:
- When the word ""walm"" is used, the color that comes out in the output is repeated three times.
- The color that is repeated corresponds to the color of the word that is immediately before ""walm"".

Given these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times. Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" can be established as a repeater of the preceding color word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the preceding color three times.",1.0,157,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the pattern in the outputs corresponding to the presence of ""walm"" in the inputs. 

- In the first input, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word right before it three times.
- In the second input, ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds with ""red."" Following the pattern identified earlier, ""walm"" is repeating ""red"" three times, as ""wif"" is right before it.
- In the third input, ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow."" ""Dax"" corresponds with ""green"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" The ""walm"" here repeated ""red"" three times after ""wif.""
- In the fourth input, ""lug walm wif lug"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue."" Again, ""walm"" repeated the color corresponding to ""lug"" three times.
- In the last input, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" ""Walm"" repeated the color for ""dax"" three times.

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it takes the color of the word that is immediately before it and repeats that color three times in the output.

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue."" There is no variation in the output in response to the input containing ""lug,"" regardless of the context in which ""lug"" appears. Therefore, the rule appears to be straightforward:

"Given the provided examples, we can induce the following:

- Every time the word ""wif"" appears, it is followed by the word ""red"" in the output.
- The word ""wif"" does not depend on its position in the input sequence to be associated with ""red"".

From this, we can deduce the rule for the word ""wif"":

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,158,wif
"Observing the examples provided, the word ""wif"" seems to consistently map to the output ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is present in the input, the output contains the color ""red"" in the corresponding position. With this in mind, let's analyze the other words:

In the first example, ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" to ""red"" as well, judging by their respective output.

In the second example, ""dax"" appears to map to ""green"" consistently. ""walm"" seems to be mapping to ""green"" in the output, but since ""wif"" follows it directly, it introduces another ""red"" to the sequence. The last word, ""zup,"" seems to correspond to ""yellow"" in the output.

In the third example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and followed by ""wif,"" it gives us ""red.""

In the fourth example, without a previous word, ""wif"" on its own still results in ""red.""

Finally, the fifth example starts with ""dax,"" giving us ""green,"" followed by ""lug,"" which results in ""blue,"" and then ""wif,"" yielding ""red.""

From these observations, we can deduce:

wif -> red

So the general rule appears to be:

Rule: The term ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.",1.0,158,wif
"Observing the examples provided, it appears the word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red."" Each instance of ""wif"" yields a ""red"" in the output sequence:

- Example 3: ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red""
- Example 4: ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
- Example 5: ""dax lug wif"" -> ""green blue red""

In all cases, ""wif"" is directly followed by ""red"" in the output, regardless of the other words present. Therefore, the rule pertaining to ""wif"" is consistent and correlates with the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,158,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look at the correspondence between the given input and the color-coded output in each example:

1. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red

2. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow

3. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

5. Input: dax lug wif
   Output: green blue red

From these examples, we can observe the following:
- Every instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the output.
- The word preceding ""wif"" does not seem to have an effect on ""wif""'s output (since ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and the absence of a word still yield red for ""wif"").
- The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, ""bluf"" corresponds to red, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, independent of the presence of ""wif.""
- ""wif"" always appears before the word it turns red, supported by the fact that, in all cases, the word following ""wif"" is translated to red.

Based on these observations, the general rule for the nonce word ""wif"" can be stated as:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color red and turns the following word red as well.",1.0,158,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color red in the output. Each example includes ""wif"" and is invariably paired with ""red"" regardless of the surrounding words. Thus, the rule I can induce from these examples is:

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.",1.0,158,zup
"To induce the rule, I will analyze the patterns and the corresponding color assignments. I need to test whether bluf has a static meaning or if it depends on context.

Looking at the examples:

1. ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" -> ""green green red yellow green""
   The color sequence for ""bluf"" is ""red,"" but the word ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" on both sides of ""bluf.""

2. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue""
   The sequence for ""bluf"" here is ""yellow,"" but it follows ""zup,"" which is associated with ""yellow"" as well, and ""wif,"" which is associated with ""red.""

3. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
   In this example, ""bluf"" translates to ""red,"" the same as the color associated with ""wif.""

4. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
   ""Bluf"" now correlates with ""green,"" the same color associated with ""dax.""

5. ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""
   Here ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" the same as the preceding ""zup.""

By analyzing these patterns, it appears that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.",1.0,158,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word that immediately follows it. Here is how it's deduced:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which correlates to the color red, and the output for ""bluf"" is also red.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" which has no color associated with it, but the output for ""bluf"" and ""lug"" are both blue, and ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" which is also blue, indicating duplication.
- The third example is similar; ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red) and precedes ""dax"" (green), with the output for ""bluf"" being red, matching the color of ""wif,"" and ""dax"" follows with green.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green) and the output for ""bluf"" is green, matching ""dax.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" (yellow) precedes and follows ""bluf,"" and the color for ""bluf"" in the output is yellow, duplicating the color associated with ""zup.""

Given these samples, the rule for ""bluf"" is therefore:

bluf -> duplicates the color of the following word.

Rule: When ""bluf"" precedes a word, the color associated with ""bluf"" in the output matches the color of the subsequent word.",1.0,158,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" means to replicate or double the color associated with the subsequent word.",1.0,158,bluf
"Considering the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" is associated with transforming the color of the preceding word to the color associated with the word following ""bluf"". For example, in the first input, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", which is then followed by ""wif"". In the output, the ""dax"" before ""bluf"" turns green (the color originally associated with ""dax"") and the ""dax"" after ""bluf"" turns red (the color associated with ""wif"").

Looking at more examples,

- In the second input, ""lug"" after ""bluf"" turns blue, and hence ""bluf lug"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue"". The triple blue might indicate that ""bluf"" not only changes the color of the preceding word to that of the following word but also repeats it two additional times.

- The third input confirms that ""bluf"" not only changes the color of the preceding word to that of the following word but also repeats that color as many times as there are letters in the following word. ""wif bluf dax"" results in ""red red green green green,"" where ""dax,"" being a 3-letter word, results in ""green"" being repeated three times.

- The fourth input, ""wif dax bluf,"" results in ""red green green,"" where once again the preceding word ""dax"" has its color changed to red and repeated based on the following word ""bluf"". However, since there are no words after ""bluf"" in this sequence, it's not entirely clear how many times the red should be repeated. The given output repeats it once, suggesting that perhaps when ""bluf"" is at the end, it defaults to one repetition.

- The fifth input, ""zup bluf dax,"" has an output of ""yellow yellow green,"" which supports the rule mentioned above. ""zup"" has its original yellow color changed to the color of ""dax"", which is green, and since ""dax"" is a three-letter word, the green is repeated three times.

Compiling these observations into a rule:

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" changes the color of the word preceding it to the color of the word following it and repeats that color as many times as there are letters in the following word. If ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence, it appears to default to one repetition of the new color.",0.8,158,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> green when following wif or dax, otherwise bluf -> yellow",0.8,158,bluf
"Observing the patterns:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""
- The presence of ""walm"" always results in a repetition of the color that precedes it.

Considering that ""walm"" always leads to the repetition of the previous color three times, we can deduce:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the preceding color three times. Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color-indicating word, replace ""walm"" with three instances of the color that precedes it.",1.0,158,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the previous word the number of times equal to the number of letters in that word.

Explanation:

- In the first example, ""lug"" correlates to ""blue."" Since ""lug"" has three letters, ""walm"" means ""blue blue blue.""
  
- In the second example, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" so ""walm"" after ""lug"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" and after ""dax"" it translates to ""green green green.""
  
- The third example is similar to the second, but without the initial ""dax.""

- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is before ""walm,"" and since ""dax"" has three letters, ""walm"" translates to ""green green green.""
  
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" and ""zup"" having three letters means ""walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" When ""dax"" follows another ""zup"", which is followed by another ""dax"" and then ""wif,"" we use the same logic for each word.

Therefore:

   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and following ""bluf,"" the word ""blue"" is repeated once.

2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   - In this case, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf."" It's unclear what ""wif"" corresponds to alone, but ""bluf"" results in ""red red."" Thus, ""wif"" might correspond to the color ""red,"" and ""bluf"" repeats it twice.

3. Input: dax zup lug zup bluf -> Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Following ""bluf,"" the word ""yellow"" is repeated once.

4. Input: lug bluf -> Output: blue blue
   - Similar to the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" repeats it once.

5. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" and ""bluf"" repeats it once.

Rule:
bluf -> The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color word that immediately precedes it. If ""x"" is a color word, then ""x bluf"" would output ""x x.""",0.8,160,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can observe how the output changes based on its presence in the input compared to the other known elements. 

From the first example:
Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green
Here, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green both times it appears, but there's an extra green before ""red"" which corresponds to ""wif"". The presence of ""walm"" is followed by another green before the pattern changes, so it seems ""walm"" may cause a repetition of the color before it.

From the second example:
Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
Here, ""wif"" correlates with red, ""zup"" correlates with yellow, ""lug"" correlates with blue, and ""dax"" correlates with green. After ""zup"" which correlates to yellow, we see ""walm"" and then two additional yellows. This supports the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color before it.

From the third example:
Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red
The first time ""bluf"" appears, it is followed by a green which corresponds to ""dax"". However, the pattern changes after the second ""bluf"", with two reds in a row instead of a green. This is after the ""walm"", suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the color before it, which is red corresponding to ""wif"".

From the fourth example:
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Again, we see ""dax"" which we know correlates with green, followed by ""walm"" and an additional green. This consistently matches the repetitions we've seen before.

From the fifth example:
Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
The pattern is consistent with previous observations where ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow, and then we see two additional yellows.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it to be repeated in the output sequence.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color of the preceding word in the sequence.",1.0,160,walm
"Based on the given examples, we observe how the output colors correlate with the presence of ""walm"" and the surrounding words. Here's the analysis:

In all instances where ""walm"" is present, the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated in the output as a sequence of the color corresponding to that word.

- Example 1: ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" which is three greens for the word ""dax"" which corresponds to a single green in other contexts.
- Example 2: ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" which is three yellows for the word ""zup"" which corresponds to a single yellow in other contexts.
- Example 3: ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"" which is three reds for the word ""wif"" which corresponds to a single red in other contexts.

Hence, we can infer that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to be repeated three times. 

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.",1.0,160,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", let's analyze the relationship between the input and output pattern:

1. Every time ""walm"" appears, the output changes to ""green"" but with an additional ""green"" for each ""dax"" that appears before it.
2. ""walm"" itself is translated as ""green"" but its presence seems to introduce additional ""green"" for each occurrence of ""dax"" before it, not after it.

Based on the output, it seems the rule for ""walm"" involves outputting a sequence of ""green"" that corresponds to every occurrence of ""dax"" before ""walm"" plus one extra green for ""walm"" itself. 

Other words maintain a consistent color mapping:
- ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green""
- ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red""
- ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" consistently maps to ""green,"" similar to ""dax""

Here are the rules applied with the examples:

Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green

- ""dax"" appears once before ""walm"", hence we have two ""green"" before ""wif"" (""green"" for ""dax"" and ""green"" for ""walm"").
- ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
- Another ""dax"" after ""walm"" translates to just one ""green"".

Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

- ""dax"" appears once before ""walm"", hence we have one additional ""green"" prior to the existing ""yellow"" for ""zup"".

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

- ""dax"" appears once before ""walm"", so two ""green"" follow the sequence of ""wif"" (""red"") before ""lug"" (""blue"").

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

- ""dax"" before ""walm"" creates two ""green"".

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

- ""dax"" appears once before ""walm"", so there is one additional ""green"" before two ""yellow"" for ""zup"".

Based on this, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> For each occurrence of ""dax"" prior to ""walm"", output an additional ""green"" followed by a ""green"" for ""walm"" itself.",0.9,160,walm
"Let's analyze the examples given to figure out the rule for ""walm"":

1. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green
   Observation: ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and before ""wif"". ""dax walm"" -> two greens; ""walm wif"" -> green then red.

2. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   Observation: ""walm"" is at the end and follows ""zup"". Post ""zup"" we have a trio of yellows.

3. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   Observation: ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug"". The sequence ""wif walm lug"" returns red red blue.
   
4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Observation: ""walm"" follows ""dax"". ""dax walm"" -> green green.

5. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   Observation: ""walm"" follows ""zup"". ""zup walm"" -> yellow yellow.

From these observations, it appears that ""walm"" serves as a repeater of the color output corresponding to the word that precedes it. Specifically, if ""walm"" follows:

- ""dax"", the output is double green.
- ""wif"", the output is double red.
- ""zup"", the output is triple yellow.
- ""lug"", as seen in the third input, might suggest ""walm"" adds a blue to the output, but we don't have enough examples to confirm this pattern.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color associated with the preceding word a specific number of times, which can be dependent on the word itself.

Rule: walm -> repeated color output based on the preceding word.",0.8,160,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let us look at the outputs corresponding to the inputs where ""walm"" appears.

In the first input, ""walm"" corresponds to three greens in a row followed by a single green after ""dax."" In the second input, ""walm"" corresponds to three yellows in a row following the pattern of the preceding word ""zup."" In the third, ""walm"" results in two reds corresponding to ""wif"" before turning to a blue for ""lug"" and returning to red once ""wif"" appears again. In the fourth input, ""walm"" corresponds to three greens again after ""dax."" And in the fifth, ""walm"" results in three yellows in a row after ""zup.""

From these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,161,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it is possible to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" by looking at the correspondence between the ""Input"" and ""Output."" 

In each case, the appearance of the word ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output:

- In the first example, ""lug dax"" in the input correlates with ""blue green"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""lug dax"" again translates to ""blue green,"" and ""dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green.""
- The third and fourth examples both contain ""dax"" without any other words between it and ""wif"" or ""zup,"" which correspond to ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively—again, ""dax"" correlates with ""green.""
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""lug dax zup"" translates to ""blue green yellow,"" reinforcing the pattern.

There is a consistent pattern where each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output, and ""dax"" specifically corresponds to ""green"" each time it appears. Therefore:

"Based on the examples provided, it is possible to infer that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. Given that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" and the fact that ""dax"" is always followed by ""green"" in the output, it can be deduced that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" 

Moreover, the word ""walm"" seems to also correspond to ""yellow,"" as in the second and fourth examples where it is translated to ""yellow"" in the output.

- In each output sequence, the word ""wif"" is translated as ""red.""
- The word ""wif"" does not appear to modify the words that come after it; instead, it seems to be a standalone term that is consistently translated the same way, regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.

Therefore, based on the examples, the rule appears to be:

It seems that ""wif"" consistently results in the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence. Additionally, other words in the sequence appear to correspond to other colors consistently. For instance, ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" again with ""red.""

Based on the examples given, we can propose the following rule:

Rule: wif -> ""red""

This means that whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, it is replaced or translated to the word ""red"" in the output.",1.0,161,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

Each instance of the word ""wif"" in the input corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output.",1.0,161,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" could act as an instruction in this constructed language to change the color associated with the next word.

1. Whenever ""lug"" appears without ""wif,"" it does not produce ""red blue,"" and the same goes for every other word that follows ""wif."" This suggests that ""lug"" itself does not mean ""red blue.""

2. Similarly, ""dax"" leads to the output ""green"" when it follows ""wif,"" but ""dax"" by itself outside this context does not give the same result.

3. The word ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" when it follows ""wif,"" but in the last two examples, it appears without ""wif"" and produces ""green.""

4. The sequence ""zup bluf wif walm"" reveals that ""wif"" impacts the word immediately following it; ""walm"" produces ""red red,"" unlike ""zup"" and ""bluf,"" which lead to ""yellow"" and ""green,"" respectively, when occurring without ""wif.""

5. When ""wif"" is repeated, as in ""wif walm,"" the result is ""red red red,"" indicating that ""wif"" seems to duplicate the color assigned to the immediately following word.

The common factor in all examples is that ""wif"" appears to prepend the color ""red"" to the output associated with the next word. The other colors generated (""blue,"" ""green,"" ""yellow"") are associated with other words (""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf""), rather than with ""wif"" itself.

Rule: wif -> ""prepend 'red' to the color associated with the following word.""",0.9,161,wif

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,161,zup
"Based on the given examples, the following patterns are observed:

- Whenever the word ""bluf"" is present, the word ""red"" immediately follows in the output.
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green.""
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the word ""blue.""
- The word ""walm"" corresponds to the word ""green,"" but when following ""dax,"" it still means ""green"", implying that ""walm"" maintains its meaning regardless of context.
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red.""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow.""

However, it should be noted that ""bluf"" always appears after ""wif"" and before ""dax"" in these examples. Without an example where ""bluf"" stands alone or is paired with different surrounding words, we can't be entirely sure of its independent meaning.

Given that ""bluf"" always results in an additional ""red"" in the output and it directly follows ""wif,"" it suggests that ""bluf"" also means ""red"" or acts as a reinforcement of the color ""red"" when next to ""wif.""

Rule: bluf -> red (when following ""wif"").",1.0,161,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the given examples and their corresponding outputs:

2.
Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug 
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

3. 
Input: lug bluf 
Output: blue blue

4. 
Input: lug bluf 
Output: blue blue

5. 
Input: wif bluf dax walm 
Output: red red green green green

Observations:
- In examples 1 and 5, ""bluf"" is placed between ""wif"" and ""dax,"" with the output colors being ""red red green."" In example 5, the word ""walm"" added after ""dax"" corresponds to additional ""green"" in the output. This suggests that ""wif"" is linked to ""red,"" ""dax"" is linked to ""green,"" and ""walm"" is also linked to ""green.""
- In example 3 and 4, ""lug bluf"" always results in ""blue blue,"" which implies that both ""lug"" and ""bluf"" correspond to the color ""blue.""
- In example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug,"" and the output sequence contains ""yellow"" followed by two consecutive ""blue."" Since ""lug"" has already been associated with ""blue"" in other examples, and there is an additional ""blue"" following ""yellow,"" this supports the inference that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Rule:
bluf -> blue",1.0,161,bluf
Rule: bluf -> blue,1.0,161,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Here are the assertions from the examples given:

- In the first example (wif bluf dax), ""bluf"" is followed by ""red"" in the output.
- In all instances, regardless of the other words surrounding it (""wif"", ""dax"", ""lug"", ""zup"", ""walm""), ""bluf"" always results in ""red"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> red

But it's also important to note that in the fifth example, the output for ""bluf dax walm"" is ""red green green green"", indicating that ""bluf"" might influence not only its own color output but also that of the subsequent words, making them repeat the output color of ""bluf"". However, the examples provided are not sufficient to deduce a comprehensive rule about the context-dependent effects of ""bluf"", so the simplest rule given the information is that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".",0.0,161,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,0.0,161,bluf
Rule: walm -> repetition of the previous color until a different color word is mentioned.,1.0,161,walm
Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the previous word.,1.0,161,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" has a transformational effect on the color word that follows it. Specifically, it appears to cause the next color word to repeat according to the color it represents. Let's look at the examples one by one:

1. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   (""zup"" is ""yellow"", followed by ""lug"" which means blue; ""walm"" causes ""lug"" to repeat three times)

2. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   (""dax"" is ""green"", followed by ""wif"" which means red; ""walm"" causes ""wif"" to repeat three times)

3. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
   (""lug"" is ""blue"", followed by ""wif"" which means red; ""walm"" causes ""lug"" to repeat three times)

4. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   (""lug"" is ""blue"", followed by ""wif"" which is red; ""walm"" causes ""wif"" to repeat three times)

5. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   (""lug"" is ""blue"", ""zup"" is ""yellow""; ""walm"" causes ""lug"" to repeat three times)

In each case, ""walm"" precedes a color, and then the output repeats that next color's word three times. In the case where ""walm"" is at the end of a string (example 4), it still causes the color just before it to repeat, indicating that its effect is indeed on the color immediately following it.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color word that follows it to be repeated three times in the output sequence.

Walm -> causes the next color word to repeat three times",0.8,161,walm
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the immediately preceding word in the sequence.,0.8,161,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the use of the nonce word 'walm' seems to have an effect on the output color pattern. Specifically, when 'walm' comes after a color word, the output repeats the color just mentioned before 'walm' for a number of times equal to the total number of words that follows 'walm', including 'walm' itself.

Here are the rule deductions based on the given inputs and outputs:

- In the first example, 'zup' which outputs as 'yellow' is followed by 'walm' and then by three other words. According to the output, 'walm' causes the next three colors to be 'yellow', which matches 'zup'.

- In the second example, 'dax' ('green') is followed by 'walm' and then by two other words. The effect of 'walm' here is generating two additional 'green' in the output.

- In the third example, 'lug' ('blue') is followed by 'walm' with only one word after it ('wif'). Correspondingly, there is one 'blue' in the output after 'lug' before the color changes to 'red' ('wif').

- In the fourth example, 'lug' ('blue') is followed by 'wif' ('red') and then 'walm'. Since 'walm' is at the end, it seemingly causes the color before it, 'red', to repeat for the total number of words remaining, which is one ('walm'), hence one 'red' after the initial 'blue' and 'red' from 'lug' and 'wif', respectively.

- The last example suggests that 'zup' ('yellow') followed by ‘walm’ with two words ('lug') afterward results in two 'yellow' in the output before returning to 'blue' which is the color for 'lug'.

Based on these observations, the rule can be summarized as:

Rule: When 'walm' follows a color word, the next colors in the sequence are the same as the color word preceding 'walm', repeating for as many times as there are words including and following 'walm'. If 'walm' is the last word, it repeats the color of the word preceding it once.

Therefore:

walm -> Causes repetition of the color word preceding it for the number of instances equal to the count of the words including and following 'walm'.",0.8,161,walm

- wif dax -> red green
- lug dax -> blue green
- dax zup -> green yellow
- zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green green red

"Based on the examples, the term 'dax' consistently translates to 'green'. Here's the justification:

- Every time 'dax' appears in the input, 'green' appears in the output.

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

The outputs for each input suggest a color associated with each word, except for the word ""walm."" Notice that whenever the word ""walm"" appears, the output color matches the color of the word just before ""walm."" For example:

1. The word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which translates to green; therefore, ""walm"" results in green.
2. The word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which translates to blue; thus, ""walm"" results in blue.

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word 'walm' is adding a repetition of the color of the word immediately preceding it. Let's analyze the examples:

- In the first example, ""dax walm wif"" outputs ""green green green red."" `Dax` corresponds to green, and `walm` appears right after it, adding two more greens before `wif`, which is red.
- In the second example, ""wif lug walm"" outputs ""red blue blue blue."" `Lug` corresponds to blue, and `walm` comes after it, repeating blue twice more.
- In the third example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" outputs ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue."" `Lug` corresponds to blue again, and `walm` follows, repeating blue twice more.
- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" outputs ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" The word before `walm` is `zup`, which corresponds to yellow, and `walm` repeats yellow twice more before the final `lug`, which is blue.

4. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
5. ""lug walm"" -> Output: blue blue blue

From these examples, it seems that when ""walm"" is used, the color immediately before ""walm"" is repeated in the output. Specifically, the output for ""walm"" matches the output for the word right before it, increasing the count of that color's output. We can see this in the following breakdown:

1. ""dax"" outputs green once, but after ""walm,"" green is output three times.
2. ""lug"" outputs blue once, but after ""walm,"" blue is output three times.
3. ""lug"" outputs blue once, but after ""walm,"" blue is output three times.
4. ""zup"" outputs yellow once, but after ""walm"" and ""lug,"" yellow is output three times, followed by blue once from the preceding ""lug.""
5. ""lug"" outputs blue once, but after ""walm,"" blue is output twice.

We might also notice that the number of color repetitions corresponds to the number of letters in the word that precedes ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,163,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Every instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,163,wif
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we can analyze the provided examples and identify any patterns correlating the input with the output:

1. The outputs are colors (green, red, blue, yellow).
2. In every input that contains ""wif,"" the output begins with red.

Let's break it down:

- Input example 1 starts with ""dax,"" which corresponds to green in the output; it ends with ""dax,"" which also corresponds to green. However, with ""wif"" present in the input, the color red is produced as part of the output sequence.
- Input example 2 contains multiple words including ""wif,"" ""walm,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug."" Each of them seems to correspond to a color in the output, with ""wif"" consistently corresponding to red.
- Input example 3 only has ""wif,"" and the output is simply red.
- Input example 4 has ""wif"" surrounded by other words and ""wif"" still corresponds to red in the output.
- Input example 5 has ""wif"" in the middle of other words and still, the part of the sequence corresponding to ""wif"" is red.

Given this consistency across examples, we can deduce a rule for the meaning of ""wif."" The rule appears to be that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,163,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" has a consistent meaning across different contexts, as it always translates to the same word in the output. The other words like ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and ""bluf"" also appear to have consistent translations based on their appearances in the input and corresponding output. Here are the observed patterns:

- ""zup"" always results in ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" results in ""blue"" when it appears after ""zup.""
- ""dax"" results in ""green"" when it appears after ""lug.""
- ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup.""
- ""wif"" results in ""red"" when it follows ""zup"" or ""lug"" or appears alone after ""zup.""
- ""bluf"" results in ""red"" when it appears after ""wif.""

From these observations, we can create a direct rule for ""zup"":

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"" (regardless of its position or the presence of other words)

For the other words, the rules seem to be:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> yellow when following zup, otherwise the rule is not clear
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red when following wif, otherwise the rule is not clear

The rules for ""walm"" and ""bluf"" are based on limited context, and more examples would be needed to fully understand any additional rules that may apply to these words in different contexts. However, for the purpose of this task, the most important rule derived is for ""zup.""",1.0,163,zup
"zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow. Other words, such as ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and ""bluf,"" correspond to other specific colors. In sequences, each word is translated independently to its respective color.",1.0,163,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word zup consistently translates to the color yellow, regardless of context within the given examples.",1.0,163,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following rules for zup and the other nonce words:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- Each occurrence of ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- When ""dax"" appears after ""lug,"" it translates to ""green.""
- The word ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- The word ""walm"" is a bit more ambiguous, but considering the context where it's used, it seems to cause the subsequent ""lug"" to repeat the color of the word before ""walm."" In the given example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" (which we know means ""yellow""), and followed by ""lug"" (which we know means ""blue""), yet the output is ""yellow yellow."" Hence, ""walm"" could be indicative of repetition for the color before it, even though this isn't perfectly clear without further examples.

Rule:
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax (following lug) -> green
- wif -> red
- walm -> causes repetition of the preceding color, based on the single given example",0.9,163,zup
"Rule: Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""

When a color word is repeated in the input, this repetition is reflected in the output sequence of colors as well. 

Thus, the rule can be stated as:
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red (based on the pattern wherein ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" may also represent ""red"")

Additionally, ""walm"" seems to serve as a repeater of the preceding color or word, because ""zup walm lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue.""

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that precedes it in the sequence. More specifically, ""bluf"" takes on the meaning of the most recent color word mentioned before it. Here's the analysis of the examples:

- ""dax lug"" corresponds to ""green blue""

Example 2:
- ""lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red red"" (bluf takes the meaning of ""wif"" which is ""red"")

Example 3:
- ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red"" (bluf takes the meaning of ""wif"" which is ""red"")
- ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green"" (walm likely means green since ""dax"" is followed by three ""green"")

Example 4:
- ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow"" (bluf takes the meaning of ""zup"" which is ""yellow"")
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Example 5:
- ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green"" (bluf takes the meaning of ""dax"" which is ""green"")

- dax wif walm -> green red red red (wif corresponds to red, walm repeats red thrice)

Rule: walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,163,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding walm the number of times ""walm"" occurs in sequence.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""lug walm zup"", lug translates to blue, and we repeat blue for each walm, followed by the color for zup (yellow).
- In the second example, ""dax wif walm"", dax translates to green, wif to red, and walm causes red to repeat (because wif is red) for as many times as walm appears, which is once in this case.
- In the third example, ""dax walm"", dax is green and there’s one walm following, so green is repeated three times, since walm translates to repeating the color thrice.
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm wif"", zup is yellow and is followed by one walm, which means repeating yellow three times, then followed by wif, which is red.
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm zup lug walm"", the pattern is blue (for lug) followed by walm which repeats blue three times, then yellow (for zup), then blue for the next lug, followed by walm which repeats blue another three times.

Hence, walm causes the immediate preceding color to repeat three times, and any subsequent walm without an intervening color causes the sequence to continue.",1.0,163,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" translates to the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, repeated three times. If ""walm"" is the first word or follows a new word that hasn't been associated with a color, then the color following ""walm"" is used as its translation. Here's the breakdown of the examples given:

- ""lug walm zup"": ""lug"" corresponds to blue, followed by ""walm"", so the output is ""blue blue blue"", and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""dax wif walm"": ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" has not been given a color, but looking at the output, it corresponds to red, followed by ""walm"", which repeats the ""wif"" color as ""red red red"".
- ""dax walm"": Since ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""walm"" repeats the color as ""green green green"".
- ""zup walm wif"": ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""walm"" repeats this as ""yellow yellow yellow"" followed by ""wif"" which corresponds to the single red.
- ""lug walm zup lug walm"": ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""walm"" repeats this as ""blue blue blue"", followed by ""zup"" which is yellow, then ""lug"" again which is blue, followed by ""walm"" which repeats the blue as ""blue blue blue"".

- ""lug walm zup"" outputs ""blue blue blue yellow,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and then ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""blue"" twice before moving to ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""dax wif walm"" translates to ""green red red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the ""red"" associated with ""wif"".
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the ""green"" from ""dax"" twice.
- ""zup walm wif"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" with ""walm"" repeating the ""yellow"" from ""zup"".
- ""lug walm zup lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue,"" showing repetition of ""blue"" both times ""walm"" appears.

- In this example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" We observe that after ""wif,"" the color does not repeat three times. This means ""walm"" must only affect the word that directly precedes it.

When ""walm"" occurs after these words, the previously mentioned color is repeated thrice.

- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- bluf is not in the inputs, but appears in the output of the last example as a repeated red, suggesting it might be an error or not relevant for determining 'walm'.

The word ""walm"" doesn't have a fixed color associated with it. Instead, the color after ""walm"" seems to repeat the color immediately before ""walm."" Here's how this works in each case:

1. In ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" is associated with blue, and the output after ""walm"" is blue repeated.
2. In ""zup walm dax lug,"" ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and the output after ""walm"" is three yellows (repetition of ""zup's"" color).
3. In ""lug walm zup lug walm,"" ""lug"" is blue, so ""walm"" results in two additional blues. Then ""zup"" is yellow, and the next ""lug"" is blue, so ""walm"" results in two additional blues.
4. ""zup wif walm"" shows ""wif"" associated with red and ""walm"" follows with red repeated twice.
5. Finally, in ""zup walm lug wif,"" after ""zup"" (yellow) comes ""walm,"" resulting in two additional yellows, followed by ""lug"" (blue), and ""wif"" (red) repeated once.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" is:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Using these associations, we can try to understand what ""wif"" translates to in terms of color:

- In the first example, between two instances of ""dax"" (which is green), ""wif"" translates to red.
- In the second example, following two occurrences of colors which have been translated to yellow (from ""zup"" and ""bluf""), ""wif"" also translates to red.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""wif"" is directly translated to red irrespective of the preceding word (""zup"" which is yellow).
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" again translates to red, even when the sequence of words before it is more complex (""zup lug zup"" -> yellow blue yellow).

Considering the direct correspondence in all examples provided, the rule for ""wif"" is consistent:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,165,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the term ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" 

In the five given examples:
- When ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- When ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""
- The appearance of ""wif"" always results in ""red.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" translates directly to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,165,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" is consistently translated to the color ""red"". To confirm the pattern, looking at the position of ""wif"" within the sequences does not seem to matter, as it always results in ""red"" regardless of its position.

Thus, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,165,wif
"Considering the examples given, it appears that each unique word maps to a unique color:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow (identical to zup, so this may be an error)
- lug -> blue

Given this pattern, we need to determine what 'wif' means. In the context of these examples, 'wif' consistently maps to the color red, regardless of its position within the sequence. Therefore, we can deduce that 'wif' corresponds to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,165,wif
"zup -> meaning. Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"". 

This conclusion is based on the consistent presence of ""yellow"" in the output whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, regardless of its position.",1.0,165,zup
"From the given examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Hence, we can induce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output.",1.0,165,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup"", let's examine the different contexts in which it appears and its corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax zup - Output: green yellow
2. Input: zup lug dax lug - Output: yellow blue green blue
3. Input: lug zup lug - Output: blue yellow blue
4. Input: wif dax zup walm - Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

In the inputs, notice that ""zup"" is always followed by one or more color outputs.

1. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and the output following ""zup"" is ""yellow"".
2. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green."" ""zup"" precedes ""lug"" and is followed by ""yellow.""
3. ""lug"" is again preceded and followed by ""zup,"" producing ""yellow"" both times.
4. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" is ""green."" The word ""zup"" precedes two instances of ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" seems to repeat the ""yellow"" color.

From these observations, it seems that ""zup"" leads to a consistent output of ""yellow,"" regardless of the context it is in. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,165,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that each word is associated with a specific color. The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"". To verify this, we can look at the examples where ""zup"" is the only changing element within a repeated sequence and it always corresponds to ""yellow"".

Here are the rules for the other words as derived from the examples, which can support the identification of the meaning of ""zup"":

- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"".
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color that comes before it. In the last example, it follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"", and so it also outputs ""yellow"".

Thus we can infer the following:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Each specific word is associated with a specific color. ""Zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow"".",1.0,165,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the context it appears in across the different examples:

1. dax zup -> green yellow
2. zup lug dax lug -> yellow blue green blue
3. lug zup lug -> blue yellow blue
4. lug zup lug -> blue yellow blue
5. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow

Let's analyze the contexts where ""zup"" appears:

- In the first example, ""zup"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""yellow"" (preceded by ""green"" which corresponds to ""dax"").
- In the second example, ""zup"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output is ""yellow blue"" (with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"").
- In the third and fourth examples, ""zup"" is in between two ""lug""s, and the output is ""yellow"" sandwiched between ""blue"" (which corresponds to ""lug"").
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" follows ""dax"" again and precedes ""walm,"" with ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup"". It's also worth noting that ""walm"" produced three ""yellow"" outputs after ""zup.""

From these examples, we can induce that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow"" regardless of what precedes or follows it. Therefore, we can rule out that ""zup"" is context-dependent and instead infer that it stands for a specific color regardless of its position in the input string.

zup -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,165,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" let's look at the correspondence between the inputs and outputs in the examples provided. 

- In the first example, ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" maps to ""yellow red red yellow blue."" The words ""zup"" and ""lug"" at the beginning and end of the sequence correspond to ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" respectively. The presence of ""bluf"" in the third position in the input is matched with the second ""red"" in the output, while ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red.""

- In the second example, ""dax bluf"" maps to ""green green."" ""dax"" can be presumed to mean ""green"" since it's the same in both input and output. The presence of ""bluf"" correlates with the second ""green.""

- In the third example, ""zup bluf"" maps to ""yellow yellow."" Since ""zup"" has been previously determined to mean ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" in this instance also corresponds to ""yellow.""

- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf dax lug"" maps to ""yellow yellow green blue."" Using the meanings we've deduced earlier, ""zup,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""yellow,"" ""green,"" and ""blue,"" respectively. Since ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow yellow,"" we can assume ""bluf,"" in this case, means ""yellow"" or indicates a repetition of the color mentioned before it.

- In the fifth example, ""dax lug wif bluf"" maps to ""green blue red red."" Given that ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif"" correspond to ""green,"" ""blue,"" and ""red,"" respectively, ""bluf"" again seems to correlate with a repetition of the color mentioned just before it, ""red.""

Given the patterns observed, the rule for ""bluf"" could be: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule:

bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" means to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before it in the sequence.",1.0,165,bluf
"bluf -> yellow when preceded by ""zup""
bluf -> green when preceded by ""dax""
bluf -> red when preceded by ""wif""

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the word immediately preceding it. If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" means ""yellow."" If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" means ""green."" If ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" means ""red.""",1.0,165,bluf
"bluf -> red when preceded by wif, green when preceded by dax, yellow when preceded by zup. Rule: The color that bluf represents changes depending on the word that comes before it.",1.0,165,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", we need to observe patterns of associated colors in the various examples provided. If we analyze each input against its output, we can try to identify the rule that dictates what color is represented by ""bluf"" and any other word that precedes or follows it.

Looking at the examples: 

- When ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" by itself, the output is ""yellow yellow."" This indicates that ""bluf"" likely represents the same color as the word that precedes it, in this case, ""yellow.""

- When ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"" by itself, the output is again a repetition of the color that precedes it, ""green green.""

- So far, the pattern suggests that ""bluf"" makes the preceding color repeat.

- In the example where ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""dax lug,"" the output is ""yellow yellow green blue,"" which further supports the rule that ""bluf"" makes the preceding color repeat and then the list continues normally.

- In the example where ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax lug wif,"" the output color for ""bluf"" is ""red"" which is not a repetition of the preceding color (""blue""). However, it seems to have no impact on the color output of ""lug,"" as ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue"" in other examples.

Given these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" causes the preceding color word to be repeated in the output, except when it directly follows certain word combinations that break the pattern. The breaking of this pattern in the last example may suggest there are additional rules or context needed which are not provided in the given examples.

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the preceding color word to repeat in the output sequence, except in certain unexplained cases that break this pattern.",0.8,165,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the outputs when the input includes ""bluf"" versus when it does not. It seems like ""bluf"" directly corresponds with a color, as indicated when ""bluf"" is included in the input, a specific color is repeated in the output. Looking at the examples:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" (""zup bluf""), the output is ""yellow yellow."" Hence, in this context, ""bluf"" corresponds to the word ""yellow.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" (""dax bluf""), the output is ""green green."" Therefore, in this context, ""bluf"" corresponds to the word ""green.""

Furthermore, it doesn't seem like ""bluf"" corresponds to a fixed color, but rather, it repeats or doubles the color word that precedes it. The context - what word precedes ""bluf"" - influences the meaning of ""bluf.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be deduced as follows:

Bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" repeats the color word of the preceding word. 

Rule: If the input word before ""bluf"" corresponds to a color in the output, then ""bluf"" causes that color to be repeated in the output immediately after it.",0.8,165,bluf
"Examining the given examples and the associated outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"". Let's analyze the patterns.

1. ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green""
2. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
3. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
4. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" -> ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red""

From these examples, we can observe that every time ""walm"" occurs, it repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it:

1. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue""
2. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red""
3. When ""walm"" is at the end of a sequence ""zup walm"" it repeats the color of the previous word, in this case ""yellow yellow"".

Therefore, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to repeat.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated.",1.0,165,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs associated with each input:

1. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
2. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
3. wif walm -> red red red
4. wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
5. lug walm zup lug zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

Looking at inputs 2 and 3 (""zup wif walm"" and ""wif walm""), we see that the presence of ""walm"" results in repeating the color associated with the word immediately before it. For example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" repeating the color red that corresponds to ""wif.""

Now, let's apply this observation to the other inputs:

1. ""lug walm dax"" should then repeat the color associated with ""lug"" (blue), which is correct in the output.
2. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" should repeat the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow), which corresponds to the repeated yellows in the output.
3. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" should repeat the color for ""lug"" (blue), which is confirmed.

Based on these observations, we can conclude that ""walm"" when following a word, causes the output color associated with that word to be repeated in the sequence. If no word comes before ""walm,"" it's not possible to determine the behavior from the given examples.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,165,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first look for patterns in the examples provided. We can start by analyzing the outputs and compare them with the given inputs. The goal is to find what output is consistently associated with the word ""walm"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.

Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""lug walm dax"" outputs ""blue blue blue green."" Since ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"" and ""dax"" by ""green"" in other examples, we can infer that ""walm"" corresponds to the repeated ""blue.""

- In the second example, ""zup wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow red red red."" Here, ""zup"" consistently associates with ""yellow"" and ""wif"" with ""red"" in other examples. Thus, ""walm"" likely results in the repeated ""red.""

- The third example, ""wif walm,"" simplifies the situation with the output of ""red red red."" Since ""wif"" is known to associate with ""red,"" it strengthens the idea that ""walm"" also correlates with ""red.""

- In the fourth example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm,"" we see ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" Here, we notice the colors we already know associated with each word except for ""walm,"" which seems to be the cause of the last three ""yellow.""

- In the final example, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" the sequence ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"" appears. Again, known associations occur except for ""walm,"" which precedes a sequence of ""blue.""

Comparatively analyzing these outputs, we see that ""walm"" is not associated with a single color, but rather it seems to cause a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. In every appearance of ""walm,"" the color before it is repeated one or more times.

Therefore, we can propose the following rule:

walm -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: If ""X"" is the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" then the output of ""walm"" will be one or more repetitions of ""X.""",1.0,165,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should examine the outputs in each occurrence of ""walm,"" ensuring we also observe the context provided by the surrounding words.

1. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
2. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
3. wif walm -> red red red
4. wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
5. lug walm zup lug zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

From these examples, we can notice:

- When ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" the output sequence always starts with ""blue blue blue"" (Examples 1 and 5).
- When ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" regardless of what precedes ""wif,"" the output sequence is a repetition of ""red"" (Examples 2 and 3).
- Example 4 is complex, but if we look for the “walm” and its output, we notice ""walm"" is followed by three ""yellow"" signals in the output, preceded by ""zup."" The word before ""walm,"" ""zup,"" yields one yellow before the sequence is influenced by ""walm.""
- In all instances, the word ""walm"" seemed to cause a repetition of three of the same color in the output.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to revolve around causing the next three outputs to be the same color as the output that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

So the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> The next three outputs will repeat the color of the output associated with the word that comes directly before ""walm"".",1.0,165,walm
"walm -> red

Rule: The word ""walm"" corresponds to the color red in the output sequence. Wherever ""walm"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.",0.0,165,walm
"lug -> blue

"lug -> blue

Rule: Lug consistently corresponds to the color blue in all given examples.",1.0,166,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue.",1.0,166,lug
"lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,166,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,166,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a color. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. 

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,166,dax
"Based on the examples provided, where the word ""dax"" appears in various positions and combinations with other non-English words, the rule for what ""dax"" means in terms of color can be deduced. Here's the reasoning:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- It does not matter if ""dax"" is at the beginning, middle, or end of the sequence.
- It does not matter what other words are around ""dax""; it always translates to ""green.""

Thus, the rule for the meaning of the word ""dax"" in these examples is consistent and can be reported as follows:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,166,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the following rule can be deduced:

- 'lug' corresponds with 'blue'
- 'dax' corresponds with 'green'
- 'bluf' corresponds with 'green'
- 'zup' corresponds with 'yellow'
- 'wif' corresponds with 'red'

Given that 'dax' consistently corresponds with the output 'green,' regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words, the meaning of 'dax' can be deduced as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,166,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the provided examples.",1.0,166,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the given examples.",1.0,166,dax
"Based on the given examples, every time the word ""wif"" appears, the output includes the color ""red."" So it can be concluded that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,166,wif

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,166,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""",1.0,166,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Hence, the meaning of ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,166,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

Each instance of ""wif"" in the input results in ""red"" in the corresponding position in the output.",1.0,166,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we can look for patterns in the examples provided:

1. When ""zup"" appears alone (Example 2), the output is ""yellow."" This suggests that ""zup"" on its own translates to ""yellow.""

2. Whenever ""zup"" appears before another word (Examples 1, 3, and 5), it precedes ""yellow"" in the output. This supports the idea that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

3. In Example 4, ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow,"" which suggests ""lug"" probably translates to ""blue"" and ""zup"" again to ""yellow.""

4. The example where ""zup"" is repeated (Example 5), ""zup lug zup lug wif,"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow blue red,"" which again confirms that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and also implies that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

Based on the consistent pattern across all examples, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> yellow",1.0,166,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following relations:

1. ""zup"" on its own translates to ""yellow.""
2. ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red.""
3. ""dax"" after a ""wif"" translates to ""green"" but followed by another ""wif"" returns to ""red.""
4. ""lug"" appears to translate to ""blue.""
5. ""walm"" after ""wif"" leads to a sequence of three ""red.""

From the given data, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position. Therefore, the rule we can infer for ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,166,zup
"zup -> yellow. Rule: When the nonce word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,166,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following correlations:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow""

From these correlations, we can deduce that each nonce word is a stand-in for a color or a sequence of colors, not dependent on surrounding context (except perhaps in quantity with a word like ""walm""). Thus:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,166,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that each word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input string.

"Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" In sequences where ""bluf"" appears, it's translated to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position or the other words present.",1.0,166,bluf
"Observing the patterns in the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to a specific color output based on a particular rule. Let's try to deduce it:

In examples 1, 3, and 4, the word ""bluf"" directly follows a color word (lug, wif, lug, respectively). Each time it follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" the output is ""blue"" again. This might suggest ""bluf"" means ""blue"" when following ""lug."" However, when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" the output is ""blue"" again, indicating that the meaning of ""bluf"" doesn't change with the preceding word.

Further, in example 2, ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""dax"" (green) and ""wif"" (red), but the output remains ""green,"" possibly indicating that when ""bluf"" is between two colors, it adopts the color on the left (in this case, green). However, in example 3, ""bluf"" yields ""blue"" even when it's between ""wif"" (red) and ""zup"" (yellow), suggesting that it retains its meaning regardless of adjacency.

In example 5, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" (red) but followed by nothing, and the output is ""red,"" which could at first seem to suggest that ""bluf"" takes on the color on its left if there's no color word on the right, but this interpretation fails to account for example 2.

However, across all examples, regardless of what words precede or follow ""bluf,"" the output is always ""blue"" for ""bluf,"" suggesting that the meaning of ""bluf"" is independent of context.

Therefore, the rule can be inferred as:
bluf -> blue. 

Rule: ""bluf"" means ""blue"" regardless of the context in which it appears.",1.0,166,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color immediately preceding it in the input sequence. Here's the breakdown of the example inputs and outputs:

1. dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green
   ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red.""

2. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
   ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green.""

3. wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green
   ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue,"" and then follows ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow.""

4. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red
   ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue.""

5. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
   ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red.""

Considering the above information, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> the color that corresponds to the word immediately before ""bluf"" in the input sequence.",0.8,166,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- Whenever the word ""bluf"" is mentioned in the input, the color ""blue"" or ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
- The word ""bluf"" seems to follow a rule where its meaning alternates between ""blue"" and ""red"" depending on its position or frequency within a sequence.

Analyzing the examples:

Example 1: The first ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"", while in the same sequence, the second ""bluf"" does not appear.
Example 2: The ""bluf"" in this example corresponds to ""green"", which does not follow the pattern from Example 1.
Example 3: The ""bluf"" is twice in this sequence and both correspond to ""blue"".
Example 4: ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"".
Example 5: ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"", following ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"".

One possible rule could be: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is output for ""lug,"" except when it directly follows ""wif,"" in which case it corresponds to whatever color ""wif"" represents.

However, Example 2 breaks the pattern since ""bluf"" is there translated to ""green,"" which does not correspond to ""lug"" (blue) or ""wif"" (red). Considering all examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" is not consistent with a single color or a simple alternation without considering additional context not given in the examples.

To determine a firm rule, we would need more data points or a consistency in the provided examples. With the inconsistency in Example 2, we can't deduce an accurate and consistent rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" from the given examples.

Therefore, based on the given examples, the best I can determine without additional context is:

Rule: ""bluf"" does not have a consistent meaning across the provided examples. More examples or context is needed to determine the rule for ""bluf"".",0.2,166,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,0.0,166,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to represent repetition of the color word that comes before it. Here's the analysis for each example:

1. Input: lug walm → Output: blue blue blue (The word ""lug"" is translated to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" leads to repeating ""blue"" two more times for a total of three.)
2. Input: lug walm dax → Output: blue blue blue green (After the three ""blue,"" the new word ""dax"" translates to ""green."")
3. Input: zup walm → Output: yellow yellow yellow (Here, ""zup"" seems to translate to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated two more times.)
4. Input: zup dax walm → Output: yellow green green green (The ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times.)
5. Input: zup bluf wif walm → Output: yellow yellow red red red (Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" translates to another ""yellow,"" then ""wif"" translates as ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated twice more.)

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it to be repeated two more times after its initial mention. When ""walm"" follows a color word, it indicates a total of three appearances of that color in the output.

Rule: walm -> The output of walm is to repeat the color word immediately preceding it two additional times, resulting in that color word being said a total of three times.",1.0,166,walm
"From the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns for the colors corresponding to the words:

1. ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
2. ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
3. ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
4. ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

Now, let's look at the occurrences of ""walm"" in the examples:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" which indicates that ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in two additional blues—three total, as ""lug"" itself translates to one blue.
- In the third example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in two additional yellows—three total, as ""zup"" itself translates to one yellow.
- In the second example, when ""dax"" is added to ""lug walm,"" we get an additional ""green"" at the end: ""blue blue blue green."" ""Dax"" is the direct translator to green, but ""walm"" itself does not seem to affect it.
- In the fourth example, ""zup dax walm"" results in ""yellow green green green."" Here, ""dax"" appears before ""walm,"" which indicates that ""walm"" is causing one additional green but does not affect ""zup"" which remains yellow.
- In the fifth example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow red red red."" ""Bluf"" translates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" is causing additional reds, but ""zup"" is still yellow. We also notice that ""wif"" is not present in either input or output, suggesting it may be a null operator or irrelevant in this context.

Based on the information above, we can induce the following rule:

walm -> Repeat the color translation of the word immediately preceding ""walm"" two additional times; essentially, repeat the last color three times total.

Rule: If a color word is followed by ""walm,"" then the output is three instances of that color.",1.0,166,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" generates a sequence of colors repeating three times, and the specific color generated is determined by the word that appears immediately before ""walm."" Here is how ""walm"" appears to function in these contexts:

- ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue,"" so when ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the color blue is repeated three times.
- ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so when ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the color yellow is repeated three times.

Looking at the examples that include ""dax"" and ""bluf wif,"" these seem to affect the sequences differently. ""Dax"" adds a color to the sequence while ""bluf wif"" adds two colors followed by three repetitions of another color. ""Dax"" appears to result in the color green, and ""bluf wif"" results in a sequence of two repeat yellows followed by three consecutive reds.

From this, we can conclude:

walm -> meaning: When following another word, generates a sequence of three repeated colors based on a rule linked to the preceding word (e.g., ""lug"" leads to blue, ""zup"" leads to yellow).

Rule: The word immediately before ""walm"" determines the color that will be repeated three times. ""Dax"" represents a single additional color (green), and a combination of words like ""bluf wif"" can lead to a slightly different sequence, suggesting those words modify the repeat pattern or the colors involved.",0.9,166,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it.

To elaborate on the observed pattern:

1. ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue"": Here, ""lug"" might be associated with the color blue, and ""walm"" causes the color blue to be repeated three times.
2. ""lug walm dax"" generates ""blue blue blue green"": Following the same logic, ""dax"" appears to be associated with the color green, and it is added once to the triple repetition of blue.
3. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"": Here, ""zup"" might be associated with the color yellow, and again, ""walm"" repeats that color three times.
4. ""zup dax walm"" leads to ""yellow green green green"": In this sequence, ""yellow"" from ""zup"" appears once, followed by green, which appears three times due to the position of ""walm"" after ""dax"" (which is associated with green).
5. ""zup bluf wif walm"" converts to ""yellow yellow red red red"": As ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" is another yellow, ""wif"" is associated with red, and ""walm"" repeats the last color mentioned three times.

From the pattern we can insinuate the rule:

Rule: If ""walm"" follows a color-indicating word, it repeats the output associated with that word three times.

So, we can define walm as:

walm -> meaning: Causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.",0.8,166,walm
"walm -> repeated color associated with the preceding word. Rule:

Based on the examples provided:
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- The addition of other words (""dax"" and ""bluf wif"") before ""walm"" changes the number of repetitions and possibly adds new colors.

Therefore, walm seems to indicate that the color associated with the preceding word should be repeated a set number of times, which is the total count of words that have come before walm, not including the word associated with the color itself. The presence of other words in the sequence before ""walm"" impacts the number of color repetitions or may introduce additional colors, but walm consistently causes the repetition of the color linked to the word immediately preceding it.",0.8,166,walm

- In ""zup wif bluf,"" ""wif"" is red so the ""bluf"" following it is also red.
- In ""zup bluf lug dax lug,"" ""zup"" is associated with yellow. Thus, the ""bluf"" after ""zup"" is yellow. ""Lug"" following ""bluf"" does not change the pattern so it remains blue based on a different rule.
- In ""wif bluf dax,"" ""wif"" is associated with red, so ""bluf"" following ""wif"" is also red. ""Dax"" stands on its own as green.",1.0,167,bluf
"From the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" changes meaning based on the word that precedes it. Let's analyze the examples provided:

1. ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red"".
2. ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green"".
3. ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow"".
4. ""lug dax lug"" without ""bluf"" leads to ""blue green blue"".

From these observations, we can infer the following rule:

When the word ""bluf"" appears after another word, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated. Here's the breakdown:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" (inferred from the ""lug dax lug"" example where ""bluf"" is not present).

Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> the preceding word's corresponding color is repeated.",1.0,167,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.,1.0,167,bluf
"Observing the given examples, we can see that every time the nonce word ""bluf"" is used, it causes the word that immediately follows ""bluf"" to repeat its designated color, as well as repeats the color designated to the word ""bluf"" itself. 

Here are the observed patterns with ""bluf"":

- In ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"", ""wif"" is associated with red, and ""zup"" is associated with yellow. When ""bluf"" follows these words, the color for each repeats (""wif"" -> red, ""bluf"" -> red, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""bluf"" -> yellow, then ""wif"" -> red).

- In ""dax bluf"", ""dax"" is associated with green, and it is followed by ""bluf"" which repeats the color green.

- In ""zup wif bluf"", ""zup"" is associated with yellow, ""wif"" is associated with red, and ""bluf"" repeats the color red from ""wif"".

- In ""zup bluf lug dax lug"", ""zup"" is associated with yellow, followed by ""bluf"" which repeats yellow. It appears that ""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""dax"" with green; however, they are not directly influenced by ""bluf"" since they do not follow it immediately.

- In ""wif bluf dax"", ""wif"" is associated with red, followed by ""bluf"" which also gives red, and then ""dax"" gives green.

From these examples, we can deduce:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the following word to be repeated once, as well as repeating its own associated color.

Thus:

bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" causes the next word to repeat its color and also repeats its own color.",0.9,167,bluf
"Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" three times.",1.0,167,walm
"walm -> repeat the last color mentioned

Rule: The word 'walm' results in the repetition of the last mentioned color for the remaining number of words following 'walm'. For instance, if the last color mentioned before 'walm' was 'red', then 'walm' means 'repeat red' for as many words as follow 'walm'. If 'walm' appears mid-sentence, the last mentioned color is repeated for each word following 'walm'. If 'walm' is the last word or there are no words after it, it repeats the last mentioned color once.",1.0,167,walm
"From the given examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" generates a repetition of the color associated with the word just before it. The number of repetitions seems to be three, except when ""walm"" is at the end, where the repetitions continue until the output ends. Here are the associations from the examples:

- ""dax"" is associated with green.
- ""lug"" is associated with blue.
- ""wif"" is associated with red.
- ""zup"" is associated with yellow.
- ""bluf"" seems to be associated with the color before it, in this case, green.

The examples illustrate:

1. ""dax lug walm"": ""lug"" is blue, followed by three more ""blue"" from ""walm"".
2. ""wif walm zup"": ""wif"" is red, followed by three ""red"" from ""walm"", and then ""zup"" is yellow.
3. ""wif walm"": ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" continues the ""red"" color until the output ends.
4. ""lug walm wif"": ""lug"" is blue, followed by three ""blue"" from ""walm"", ending with ""wif"" which is red.
5. ""wif bluf dax walm"": ""wif"" is red, ""bluf"" is green because it takes the color of ""wif"", ""dax"" is green, and ""walm"" repeats the ""green"" thrice more.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is:

**Rule:** Walm -> Replicates the color of the preceding word three times, or continues the color if it's the concluding word in the sequence.",0.9,167,walm
"To deduce the meaning or the rule concerning the nonce word ""walm,"" let's start by analyzing the provided examples:

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

2. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow

3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

4. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

Observing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, let's identify patterns and instances of ""walm"":

- It seems that ""walm"" produces multiple outputs of the preceding color word. Examples 1, 3, and 5 show ""walm"" repeating the color associated with the preceding word (green, red, green respectively).

- The number of repeated color outputs corresponding to ""walm"" can vary. For instance, we have three repetitions after ""wif"" (red) in example 3, and we have three repetitions after ""dax"" (green) in example 5.

- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" but is followed by another word ""zup,"" which results in three reds (repeating ""wif"") and then a yellow (presumably the color corresponding to ""zup"").

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it, several times (possibly three times).

Rule: walm -> It causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it multiple times (potentially three times based on examples 3, 4, and 5).",0.8,167,walm
"Based on the examples given, we can infer that the nonce word ""walm"" leads to the output of a color word being repeated multiple times. The number of repetitions and the specific color produced seems to depend on the preceding color word. The color words can be matched as follows:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow

Now, by examining the pattern in the context of the provided examples, we notice:

- Example 1: ""dax lug walm"" -> dax corresponds to green, lug corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" resulted in blue being repeated three more times.
- Example 2: ""wif walm zup"" -> wif is red, and ""walm"" resulted in red being repeated two more times before the next color zup (yellow) is mentioned.
- Example 3: ""wif walm"" -> wif is red, and ""walm"" resulted in red being repeated two more times.
- Example 4: ""lug walm wif"" -> lug is blue, and ""walm"" resulted in blue being repeated two more times before the next color wif (red) is mentioned.
- Example 5: ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> wif is red, bluf doesn’t seem to correspond to anything and is perhaps ignored, dax is green, and ""walm"" resulted in green being repeated two more times.

Given these observations, a consistent rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the previous color word a certain number of times. ""Walm"" seems to trigger a repetition of the last valid color word said right before it. The count of repetitions varies in the examples, making the exact quantity potentially conditional on additional context not provided. However, the general rule is that it at least doubles the occurrence of the preceding color word.

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can analyze the occurrences of the word in the given input and the corresponding output.

- In the first example, the appearance of ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is between ""zup"" and ""lug"" and translates to ""red"" in that position as well.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" again follows ""zup"" but precedes ""lug"" and still corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is placed after ""wif"" and corresponds to ""red.""

From the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when following ""wif"" and corresponds to ""yellow"" when following ""zup."" However, this requires an additional distinction: in the second example, where ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" yields ""yellow red red yellow blue,"" although ""bluf"" is following a ""wif,"" it corresponds to ""red,"" not ""yellow."" This suggests that ""bluf"" might correspond to ""red"" consistently, and the yellow in the other examples might come from ""zup.""

Analyzing the other words in comparison to the colors, ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue"" consistently. However, ""lug"" yields both blue and yellow outcomes when it follows ""zup,"" indicating ""zup"" could mean yellow.

If we assign ""lug"" as ""blue,"" ""wif"" as ""red,"" and ""zup"" as ""yellow,"" the outputs become consistent with the translations. ""dax"" seems to correspond to the color not represented by the previous colors, which appears to be ""green.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be independent of context; ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red"" in the given data set.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples and their outputs step by step.

1. In the first example, ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow,"" we can't conclude much about ""walm"" yet without comparing it to the other examples.

2. In the second example, ""wif zup walm dax zup"" translates to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow,"" we observe that ""wif"" always translates to red and ""zup"" always translates to yellow. ""Dax"" probably translates to green since it's the last word before the sequence ends with green. Therefore, ""walm"" here translates to yellow.

3. In the third example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" translates to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"". We can now see that ""lug"" translates to blue, and at the end ""walm"" seems to translate to yellow again since it's surrounded by ""zup(s)"" which translates to yellow.

4. The fourth example, ""zup lug walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue red red red"". ""Walm"" appears twice, once it corresponds to blue, and the second time it corresponds to red. This suggests that ""walm"" takes the color of the word preceding it.

5. In the fifth example, ""lug zup walm lug"" matches ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". Again, ""walm"" takes the color yellow, which is the color of the word before it (in this case ""zup"").

Based on these observations, we can deduce a rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" takes the color of the word that directly precedes it.

So, walm -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,168,walm
"Reviewing the given examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

2. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

3. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

4. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

5. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

By comparing the inputs to the outputs, a pattern regarding ""walm"" can be discerned:

- In examples 1 and 4, we find instances where ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red,"" and in example 4, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red""; the presence of ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" generates red outputs.
- In example 2, ""wif zup walm"" leads to ""red yellow yellow,"" suggesting that the presence of ""walm"" immediately after ""zup"" gives a yellow output.
- In examples 3 and 5, ""walm"" appears at the end or just before a repeated word and corresponds to the repetition of the last color before it (yellow in both cases).

Based on the given information, ""walm"" seems to repeat the last color output that occurred before it. However, when it follows ""wif,"" it produces a red output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last mentioned color, unless it directly follows ""wif,"" then it's red.",0.8,168,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", we need to examine the patterns between the input and output, taking into account the positions and occurrences of ""walm"" and how they correlate with the output.

In the given examples:

1. When ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" the output is red.
2. When ""walm"" is the last word, the output ends with yellow.
3. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is blue.
4. When ""walm"" appears alone after one instance of ""lug,"" the output is blue.
5. ""Walm"" doesn't seem to have a fixed color associated with it and is instead influenced by its position and preceding words in the sequence.

Given these observations, it seems that ""walm"" affects the output color based on specific conditions rather than having a fixed meaning. Let's attempt to deduce the rule:

- If ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" it outputs red.
- If ""walm"" appears at the end, the last color in the output is yellow.
- If ""walm"" follows ""zup"" or ""lug,"" it outputs blue.
- When ""walm"" is repeated (""wif walm""), it seems to maintain the color associated with its condition (red after ""dax"", blue after ""lug"" or ""zup"").

From these observations, one possible rule could be that ""walm"" signifies a change in color that is contingent on the word that precedes it and possibly its position within the sequence.

Rule: walm -> The meaning of ""walm"" changes based on the word(s) that precede it and its position in the input. It outputs red when following ""dax,"" blue when coming after ""zup"" or ""lug,"" and the output ends with yellow when ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence.",0.8,168,walm
"Analyzing the given examples, one can attempt to infer a rule by examining the position of ""walm"" and the corresponding output colors. Here's the observation for each input where ""walm"" appears:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - After ""walm,"" ""dax"" leads to ""red,"" and ""zup"" leads to a ""green"" followed by a ""yellow"".

2. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   - After ""walm,"" ""dax"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""zup"" leads to a ""green"" followed by a ""yellow"".

3. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""Walm"" is the final word, followed by three ""yellow"".

4. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   - After the first ""walm,"" ""wif"" leads to ""blue"" and the second ""walm"" leads to three ""red"".

5. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - After ""walm,"" ""lug"" leads to ""yellow"" and another ""blue"".

By looking at the outputs after the word ""walm"", it seems that the word following ""walm"" is reflected in the color output, but not immediately; there is one or more intermediary color before the expected one based on the next word:

- ""dax"" is commonly associated with ""green,"" but when preceded by ""walm,"" ""dax"" leads to ""red"" or ""yellow."" 
- ""zup"" is associated with both ""yellow"" and ""green.""
- ""wif"" is consistently ""red.""
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue.""

However, a clear, consistent rule for ""walm"" is not immediately apparent from these examples alone. One possible rule could be that ""walm"" influences the color output of the word(s) following it, by perhaps delaying the color association or by changing the expected color based on the next word's typical output.

If we consider ""walm"" as a kind of color filter or a modifier, we might theorize that ""walm"" makes the next word produce ""yellow"" color one or more times (since ""yellow"" occurs in every output after ""walm""), and then the regular color pattern follows.

A hypothesis could be:
- ""walm"" causes the next word to output ""yellow,"" and after the yellow(s), normal color associations return.

The rule is uncertain, as there is not enough data to accurately conclude the function of ""walm."" However, this hypothesis seems most consistent with the provided data.

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the presence of other words before ""dax"" adds additional colors to the output in the following manner:

- ""wif"" before ""dax"" adds ""red.""
- ""lug"" before ""wif dax"" adds ""blue"" in addition to ""red.""

In this example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
Output: red red yellow red blue green

In this final example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

Since ""bluf"" produces different colors in different contexts, it cannot directly correspond to a single color. However, it appears that ""bluf"" takes the color output by the word that precedes it. In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output for ""dax"" is ""green,"" so ""bluf"" results in a green output. The same pattern follows for all other examples; ""bluf"" mirrors the color of the word before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word in the sequence.",1.0,169,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can see a pattern regarding the correspondence between the input words and the output colors. Focusing on the occurrences of the word ""bluf"" and the colors that follow it in the output, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule for ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""green"" in the output.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""red"" in the output.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""red"" again.

When examining other words, such as ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup,"" we can see they have consistent mappings to ""green,"" ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. However, ""bluf"" does not seem to map to a consistent color itself. Instead, it appears that ""bluf"" may be a rule or operation that causes a repetition or duplication of the color represented by the word that follows it in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be a duplicator or repeater for the color output of the next word:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color output of the following word.",0.8,169,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, each word seems to be associated with a color as an output. Here's the correlation:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red

Therefore, looking at the pattern when the word ""bluf"" appears, it seems to correspond to a color change from the previous color mentioned. However, when ""bluf"" is the first color-related word, it defaults to blue. Analyzing the examples:

1. In ""dax bluf lug,"" the pattern is green (from ""dax""), changing to the next color, which is blue (from ""bluf""), and then blue again (from ""lug"").
2. In ""zup dax bluf,"" the pattern is yellow (from ""zup""), changing to the next color, which is green (from ""dax""), and then green again (from ""bluf"").
3. In ""zup lug zup bluf lug,"" the pattern is yellow (from ""zup""), blue (from ""lug""), yellow again, and now ""bluf"" should represent the next color after yellow, but since there's no context for what comes after yellow, it defaults to yellow, and then the pattern repeats with blue.
4. In ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf,"" the pattern is yellow, green, yellow, green, red, and then ""bluf"" should represent the next color after red, but it results in red again.
5. With ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax,"" red is followed by ""bluf,"" which gives red again, then yellow, red, blue, and green.

From these examples, it's difficult to establish a clear rule since ""bluf"" sometimes repeats the previous color, and other times it represents the color blue, which might be its inherent color when context doesn't influence it.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is inconsistent based on the given examples, suggesting two possibilities when ""bluf"" appears:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is not the first color-related word in a sequence, it repeats the output color of the word before it. When ""bluf"" is the first color-related word, it defaults to blue. However, without more consistent data, we cannot form a definitive rule.",0.5,169,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> yellow

Explanation:
Comparing the inputs with their respective outputs, we can see that whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, the corresponding output is ""yellow.""

"Based on the examples given, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to mean repeating the color of the previous word thrice. Here's how that rule applies in each example:

Input: dax wif walm -> Output: green red red red
- ""walm"" means three reds following the color red, which is given for ""wif"".

Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue
- ""walm"" indicates three blues following the color blue, which corresponds to ""lug"".

Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green
- ""walm"" means three reds after ""wif"", and then ""dax"" changes the sequence by adding a green.

Input: dax walm zup -> Output: green green green yellow
- Here, ""walm"" translates into three greens after the color for ""dax"", which is green, followed by a yellow for ""zup"".

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
- ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" which is blue, three times, and then the sequence continues with green for ""dax"", red for ""wif"", followed by a change with ""bluf"" and back to ""dax"".

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning is the repetition of the color represented by the previous word three times.",1.0,169,walm
"walm -> meaning.

By examining the given examples, we can infer the following pattern:

- When the word 'walm' comes after 'dax', the output is a repetition of 'green'.
- When the word 'walm' comes after 'wif', the output is a repetition of 'red'.
- When the word 'walm' comes after 'lug', the output is a repetition of 'blue'.
- The number of repeated colors corresponds to the position of 'walm' in the input sequence.

Based on the given examples, the term 'walm' seems to indicate that the color associated with the word immediately preceding it should be repeated as many times as the position of 'walm' in the sentence. For example, if 'walm' is the second word in the input, the preceding color is repeated twice.

Rule: 'walm' causes the color associated with the word right before it to be repeated in the output the same number of times as the position of 'walm' in the input sequence.",1.0,169,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following correlations between the input and output:

- Each occurrence of ""walm"" corresponds to a series of the same color.
- The color that repeats is not random; it depends on the word that appears immediately before ""walm"":
  - After ""dax,"" the color is green.
  - After ""wif,"" the color is red.
  - After ""lug,"" the color is blue.
- The number of times the color repeats corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned.
- The color that corresponds to ""walm"" does not affect the color output of the other words. For example, ""dax"" always results in green, and ""wif"" always results in red, regardless of the presence and position of ""walm.""

Given the pattern observed in the examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

**Rule:** When preceded by a word, ""walm"" causes the output color corresponding to that word to be repeated for as many times as ""walm"" is mentioned in a sequence. If ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the repeated color is green; if ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the color is red; if ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the color is blue.

Hence, we can state:
walm -> Causes the output color of the preceding word to repeat.",1.0,169,walm
"walm -> repeat the color of the previous word.

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color of the word directly preceding it to be repeated for the same number of times ""walm"" implies. If ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color green, then the output is multiple greens. If ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, then the output is multiple reds. The number of colors ""walm"" repeats seems to be three, as seen in the second example ""lug walm"" with the output being ""blue blue blue.""",1.0,169,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the repeated pattern is that the word ""walm"" results in a series of red when preceded or followed by ""wif"", blue when near ""lug"", and green when near ""dax"". Additionally, it seems the color repeats for as many times as the word ""walm"" is in sequence. The word ""zup"" seems to produce yellow but does not affect the repetition of the color produced by ""walm"". 

The rule appears to be that ""walm"" adopts the color of the word immediately adjacent to it, and repeats that color multiple times corresponding to the number of times ""walm"" appears.

So, ""walm"" -> meaning. Meaning: ""walm"" generates a repetition of the color associated with the adjacent keyword, repeating as many times as ""walm"" appears in sequence.

Rule: If ""walm"" is next to ""dax"", it outputs green repeated as many times as ""walm"" appears. If next to ""wif"", it outputs red repeated as many times as ""walm"" appears.

Furthermore, the context shows that other nonce words may have their own color associations—like ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""—and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

The rule, inferred from the examples, appears to be a direct mapping from nonce words to color names. Therefore:

"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rules for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" and other words:

1. ""wif"" by itself is translated to ""red"".
2. When ""wif"" is in a sequence with other words, it translates to ""red"" and the words immediately following ""wif"" adopt a color based on a pattern.

From the examples:
- ""dax"" after ""wif"" is translated to ""green"".
- ""zup"" after ""wif"" is translated to ""yellow"".
- ""bluf"" after ""wif"" is unchanged and appears to translate to ""yellow""; however, ""bluf"" without ""wif"" preceding it translates to ""blue"".
- ""lug"" appears to always translate to ""blue"", whether it follows ""wif"" or not.
- When ""wif"" directly follows another ""wif"", it appears to be an exception to the rule and ""wif"" translates to ""red"" while the second ""wif"" translates to ""red"" also, instead of adopting a color based on the pattern.

Also, note that the last word in a sequence tends to be the same color as its translation regardless of whether ""wif"" precedes it or not (as seen with ""lug"" and ""bluf"").

Given these observations, we can induce the following rule related to ""wif"":

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red"". When ""wif"" is followed by another word, ""wif"" still translates to ""red"", but the following word colors are influenced by their position in relation to ""wif"". ""dax"" after ""wif"" is ""green"", ""zup"" after ""wif"" is ""yellow"", ""bluf"" without ""wif"" before it is ""blue"", but if ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", ""bluf"" is ""yellow"". ""lug"" is consistently ""blue"" regardless of its position relative to ""wif"". If ""wif"" directly follows another ""wif"", they both translate to ""red"", breaking the usual pattern for words following ""wif"".

So, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> ""red"". The color translation of a word following ""wif"" is influenced by the word's identity and its position following ""wif"", with the exception that a ""wif"" following another ""wif"" is also ""red"".",0.9,170,wif
"Using the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" The other words appear to follow a pattern correlating with different colors:

- ""walm"" -> red

Based on the pattern, the rules for these words seem to be consistent, with each word directly translating to a specific color irrespective of position in the sequence. However, there is a potential anomaly with ""walm,"" as it translates to ""red,"" which is the same as ""wif."" It's possible that ""walm"" may also mean ""red,"" or there could be additional contextual rules that are not clear from the examples provided.

For the purpose of this task, and based solely on the examples you've given, we can deduce:

- ""wif"" -> red
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""bluf"" -> blue
- ""walm"" -> not explicitly given, but seems to follow the rule where it is repeated thrice, which suggests ""walm"" might translate to ""blue blue blue"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be: 

Rule: ""bluf"" -> blue",1.0,170,bluf
"To deduce what bluf stands for, let's compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs systematically.

1. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif

2. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue
   - There is no sequence before bluf, but it repeats the color of lug, which is blue.

3. Input: lug dax bluf

Observing all the patterns, it seems that the word 'bluf' repeats the color of the previous sequence. When there's only 'lug bluf,' it repeats the color blue because there's nothing before lug. Putting all these observations together, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",1.0,170,bluf

- Example 4: wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
- Example 5: lug dax bluf wif dax -> blue green green red green

1. ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green."" 
2. ""lug bluf"" leads to ""blue blue.""
3. ""lug dax bluf"" leads to ""blue green green,"" where it takes ""dax"" (green) and repeats it, ignoring ""lug"" which came before ""dax.""
4. ""wif zup bluf"" leads to ""red yellow yellow,"" meaning ""bluf"" repeats ""zup"" (yellow).
5. ""lug dax bluf"" leads to ""blue green green,"" meaning ""bluf"" again repeats ""dax"" (green) that came right before it.

From the patterns, ""bluf"" seems to function as a duplicator for the immediately preceding color term.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color mentioned directly before it.",1.0,170,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we will analyze the patterns surrounding its use in the given examples. 

In the first example, ""bluf"" is placed between ""dax"" and ""wif,"" and it results in ""green red."" However, in this case, the word ""wif"" is translated as ""green,"" which is inconsistent with other examples where ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

In the second example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue."" Here, ""bluf"" directly follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" and results in the output being the same color ""blue.""

In the third example, ""lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue green green."" Based on this, ""bluf"" seems to translate to the same color as the word preceding it, which in this case is ""dax"" that translates to ""green.""

In the fourth example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue."" Again, when looking at ""bluf,"" the word that precedes it is ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" and the output color for ""bluf"" is again ""yellow."" 

In the last example, ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" translates to ""blue green green red green."" Similar to the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in the color ""green"" which is the same as the color translation for ""dax.""

Based on the examples, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it. If there is no previous color word, then the default color output for ""bluf"" is ""blue,"" as shown in the second example where ""bluf"" is the second word and translates to ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the preceding color word; if no preceding color word, then ""blue.""",0.8,170,bluf
Rule: bluf -> green.,0.0,170,bluf
Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word multiple times. The number of repetitions appears to equal the number of letters in the preceding word.,1.0,170,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to correspond to a repetition of the color associated with the previous word. To confirm this rule, observe the following patterns:

- Input: ""dax lug walm"" -> Output: ""green blue blue blue"". Here, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to the color blue. After ""walm,"" the word ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- Input: ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" -> Output: ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"". In this example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to the color red. After ""walm,"" the word ""red"" is repeated three times, followed by ""lug,"" which means blue.
- Input: ""wif walm dax zup"" -> Output: ""red red red green yellow"". Here, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with the color red. After ""walm,"" the word ""red"" is repeated three times.
- Input: ""dax walm"" -> Output: ""green green green"". In this case, ""dax"" comes before ""walm"" and corresponds to green. After ""walm,"" the word ""green"" is repeated three times.
- Input: ""zup lug walm"" -> Output: ""yellow blue blue blue"". ""Lug"" precedes ""walm"" and correlates with the color blue. The word ""blue"" is repeated three times after ""walm.""

Given these observations, ""walm"" causes the associated color of the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Causes the associated color of the prior word to be repeated three times.",1.0,170,walm
"Rule: walm -> the color preceding ""walm"" repeated three times. 

For instance, in ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" refers to the color blue, so ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""",1.0,170,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here's how:

- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and is followed by ""walm"", resulting in ""blue blue blue blue"".
- In the second example, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"", and the output is a repetition of ""blue"" three times after the initial ""blue"".
- In the third example, ""wif"" is associated with ""red"" and is followed by ""walm"", leading to ""red red red"".
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is followed by ""walm"", producing ""green green green"". 
- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and is followed by ""walm"", resulting in ""blue blue blue blue"".

Rule: walm -> Represents a repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word, repeating that color three times.",1.0,170,walm
"To induce the rule for the nonce word ""walm"", let's analyze the commonalities between each example:

1. Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue
2. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
3. Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
4. Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
5. Input: zup lug walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue

Looking at the outputs, we can notice that whenever ""walm"" is present in the input, the output consists of a repetition of the color that was outputted directly before ""walm."" More specifically, ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to repeat three times:

1. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""blue"" repeated three times.
2. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.
3. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.
4. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times.
5. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.

Therefore, ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color word that appears just before it in the input.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color to repeat three times.",1.0,170,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.",1.0,171,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in all given examples.",1.0,171,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, the output contains the color ""blue"" in the corresponding position.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,171,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in all of the provided examples.",1.0,171,lug
"lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word 'lug' translates to the color 'blue' in each example provided.",1.0,171,lug
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Each subsequent word corresponds to a different color. ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" probably means yellow, the same as ""zup"". Since ""walm"" corresponds to blue just like ""lug"", it seems that multiple nonce words can correspond to the same color.

Rule: ""dax"" -> Green. Other words map to colors as follows: ""zup"" and ""bluf"" -> Yellow, ""lug"" and ""walm"" -> Blue, ""wif"" -> Red.",1.0,171,dax
"From the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" always correlates with the color ""green"" at the beginning of the output sequence. Let's look at the other words and their corresponding color outputs to determine if there is a pattern:

- ""zup"" consistently correlates with the color ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" consistently correlates with the color ""blue.""
- ""wif"" consistently correlates with the color ""red.""
- ""bluf"" correlates with the color ""yellow"" in the one instance it is provided, which might indicate a rule or context we are not fully privy to.
- ""walm"" correlates with the color ""blue"" in the one instance it is provided, perhaps suggesting that it might have the same output as ""lug,"" or there may be another rule at play.

Based on the consistent appearance of ""green"" at the beginning of the output whenever ""dax"" is at the beginning of the input, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"" within these inputs.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,171,dax
"
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following rule:

dax -> green

This sequencing suggests that each nonce word following ""dax"" translates to a specific color. ""Dax"" itself consistently translates to ""green"" in every example.

Further analyzing the examples:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- bluf -> yellow
- walm -> blue (since it appears in the last example and yields blue as the output alongside ""lug"")

Rule:
- dax = green
- Every other nonce word following ""dax"" has a corresponding color.",1.0,171,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to analyze the patterns and correlations between the input strings and their corresponding output colors.

In every output sequence, ""green"" appears as the first color. The word ""dax"" also appears as the first word in every input string. This consistent placement suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Other words in the input sequences correspond with specific colors in the output. The word ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" When ""zup"" is repeated in the input, it correlates with repeated ""yellow"" in the output except when it's followed by ""bluf,"" which seems to change the color that follows ""zup"" to ""yellow"" as well.

Based on these observations, we can construct the following rule:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" and when it appears in an input, the first color in the output will be ""green."" Each subsequent word in the sequence has its own corresponding color: ""wif"" -> red, ""lug"" -> blue, ""zup"" -> yellow. If ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the color following ""zup"" changes to ""yellow"" instead of being its usual corresponding color. The word ""walm"" seems to correspond to the color ""blue"" based on its only appearance in the given inputs and outputs.",0.9,171,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"". Every input sequence starts with ""dax,"" and every output sequence starts with ""green."" Thus we can deduce the rule:

Rule: dax -> green

The rest of the words seem to correspond to specific colors too, with ""wif"" mapping to ""red,"" ""lug"" mapping to ""blue,"" ""zup"" mapping to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" seems to map to ""yellow"" based on the last example (though it may be a case of repetition, as ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"").

However, the word ""walm"" doesn't appear to have a single consistent color output, as it is followed by blue two times in the last example. This suggests that ""walm"" may change to match the color of the word directly preceding it. The rule for ""walm"" would then be to repeat the color of the preceding word. 

In summary, based on the excerpts given:

Rule: 
dax -> green
wif -> red
lug -> blue
zup -> yellow
bluf -> yellow (assumed based on limited data)
walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word",0.8,171,dax
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.",1.0,171,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""",1.0,171,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,171,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output.",1.0,171,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" No context changes its meaning in the given cases.

Therefore, the rule is: wif -> red.",1.0,171,wif
zup -> yellow. Rule: The nonce word zup is consistently translated to the color yellow in all provided examples.,1.0,171,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the output includes the word ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow",1.0,171,zup
"Based on the examples provided and their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""zup"".

1. When ""zup"" follows ""lug"" (example 1 and 2), the output is ""yellow"".
2. When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" (example 3), the output is ""yellow"".
3. When ""zup"" precedes ""wif"" (example 4), the output is ""yellow"".
4. When ""zup"" follows ""wif"" (example 5), the output is ""yellow"".

From these observations, ""zup"" consistently maps to the output ""yellow"", regardless of its position relative to the other words in the sequence. It doesn't seem to be dependent on the context; ""zup"" has a one-to-one correspondence with ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,171,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: Regardless of position or surrounding words, ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,171,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. 

This is evidenced by:
- Each instance of the word ""zup"" in the input corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""zup"" appears in various positions in the input sentences (at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end), and it always maps to ""yellow"" regardless of its position.

Hence, the rule is:

zup -> yellow",1.0,171,zup
"Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word that directly precedes ""bluf."" If ""bluf"" is the first word, there is no color to repeat, and it appears that ""bluf"" does not generate an output in this particular case.

Evidence to support the rule:

- In ""dax bluf,"" the color associated with ""dax"" is green. Directly after ""bluf,"" we see green repeated.
- In ""wif bluf dax,"" the color for ""wif"" is red and the color for ""dax"" is green. The output after ""bluf"" is red, showing that ""bluf"" causes the color for ""wif"" to repeat before continuing with the sequence.
- In ""lug wif bluf,"" the color for ""lug"" is blue and ""wif"" is red. The output for ""bluf"" in this case is red, which is the color associated with ""wif,"" the word right before ""bluf.""
- In ""lug bluf dax lug,"" the sequence blue-blue-green-blue occurs. ""Bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug"" (which is blue) before moving on to ""dax.""
- In ""lug bluf wif,"" ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the color blue gets repeated before continuing with the color for ""wif,"" which is red.

Thus the rule is confirmed with the provided examples.",1.0,171,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can see a pattern that suggests the meaning of the word ""bluf"" is related to the color that precedes or is associated with the word that follows ""bluf."" Let's analyze the examples:

1. dax bluf -> green green
   In this example, the word ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and when ""bluf"" is used after ""dax,"" the output is ""green green."" This suggests that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word.

2. wif bluf dax -> red red green
   Here, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The word ""bluf"" is sandwiched between them, and it repeats the color of the word before it, which is ""red.""

3. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
   ""Lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and repeats its color, which is ""red.""

4. lug bluf dax lug -> blue blue green blue
   ""Lug"" is ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is again ""blue."" ""Bluf"" follows the first ""lug"" and repeats ""blue.""

5. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red
   ""Lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red."" ""Bluf"" follows ""lug"" and repeats ""blue.""

Rule:
bluf -> repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it.",1.0,171,bluf
"Given the input and output examples, we can deduce the following:

The word ""bluf"" seems to change its meaning based on a word that immediately precedes it. Here's the pattern we can observe:

1. When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""green.""
2. When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""
3. When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue.""

With these observations in mind, the meaning of ""bluf"" appears to depend on the word that comes before it. Specifically, ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the preceding word:

- ""dax"" is associated with ""green,""
- ""wif"" is associated with ""red,""
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule we can infer is:

Rule: bluf takes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Considering the consistency across all given examples, we can write:

bluf -> meaning: Meaning is the color associated with the preceding word.
Rule: If the preceding word is ""dax"", the meaning is ""green""; if it's ""wif"", the meaning is ""red""; if it's ""lug"", the meaning is ""blue"".",1.0,171,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to act as a mirror of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the analysis:

- In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and so does ""bluf.""
- In ""wif bluf dax,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" immediately follows it, taking the same color ""red."" ""Dax"" remains ""green.""
- In ""lug wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" follows, taking the same color ""red.""
- In ""lug bluf dax lug,"" the word ""bluf"" mirrors the color of ""lug,"" which is ""blue."" 
- In ""lug bluf wif,"" ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and mirrors the color ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

"walm -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: When the word 'walm' appears in an input, the output is the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word in the input thrice.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in an input, it results in the output repeating the color that corresponds to the last word before ""walm"" three times.

- ""wif lug dax walm"" has the color green before ""walm,"" resulting in ""green green green"" after the initial ""red blue""
- ""wif dax zup walm"" has yellow before ""walm,"" thus ""yellow yellow yellow"" in the output
- ""dax wif walm"" has red before ""walm,"" hence ""red red red"" in the output",1.0,171,walm

"From analyzing the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Let's examine each case:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   In this case, the word 'dax' precedes the word 'walm', and the output is ""green green green"".

2. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   The word 'walm' follows the sequence 'wif lug dax'. 'Wif' corresponds to 'red', 'lug' to 'blue', and 'dax' to 'green'. The three occurrences of 'green' at the end correspond to 'dax walm', just as in the first example.

3. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   The appearance of 'walm' after 'zup' results in 'yellow' being repeated three times. This suggests that 'walm' might cause a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

4. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   In this case, 'walm' follows 'wif', which corresponds to 'red'. The color 'red' is then repeated three times, just as in the other examples where the color associated with the word right before 'walm' repeats three times.

Considering these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" is likely to cause a repetition of the color associated with the word right before it, specifically repeating that color three times.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to repeat three times.",0.9,171,walm
"From the provided examples, we can notice a pattern where the output colors correspond to the input words. Specifically, the number of colors in the output is directly proportional to the number of words in the input, and each word seems to have a designated color:

- ""dax walm"" consistently outputs ""green green green,"" implying ""dax"" might translate to ""green.""
- ""wif"" seems to translate to ""red"" as it's the only word in common between ""wif lug dax walm"" -> ""red blue green green green"" and ""wif dax zup walm"" -> ""red green yellow yellow yellow,"" and both times it's translated to ""red.""
- ""lug"" yields ""blue,"" ""zup"" yields ""yellow,"" based on their unique positions in the inputs and outputs.

Now, let's determine what ""walm"" represents. Each time ""walm"" is added to the input, there are two or more ""green"" outputs at the end. The repeat occurrence of ""green"" suggests a rule directly linked to ""walm."" Since ""dax"" also corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" produces one more ""green"" than the number of times ""dax"" appears, the rule for ""walm"" appears to involve repeating the color associated with ""dax.""

Based on this pattern, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> replicate the color associated with the word ""dax"" (green) as many times as the word ""dax"" occurs plus one additional time.",0.9,171,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer a mapping of nonce words to colors. Keeping consistent with the outputs given:

- ""wif"" maps to ""red""
- ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""

The position of 'blue' in the output does not seem to depend on the position of 'lug' in the input, but rather, it appears every time 'lug' is present in the input. This implies that 'lug' translates directly to the color 'blue', independent of the context or position in the sequence.

- ""zup lug zup wif dax"" outputs ""yellow blue yellow red green""
- ""lug zup dax lug"" outputs ""blue yellow green blue""
- ""dax lug"" outputs ""green blue""

Looking carefully, we notice that:

- Each time the word ""lug"" appears, the color ""blue"" appears in the output.
- The word ""lug"" does not seem to be affected by its position in the input sequence.
- Other words in the input (such as ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax"") correspond to their own respective colors (""wif"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green"").

- In ""zup bluf,"" the word before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that comes directly before it.

Rule: bluf -> The color corresponding to the word preceding bluf.",1.0,172,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red when preceded by ""wif"", otherwise bluf -> the color word that precedes it.

Evidence:

1. ""dax zup lug bluf"" -> ""green yellow blue blue"". Bluf follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" so bluf takes the color blue.

2. ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red green red red"". Bluf follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" so bluf takes the color red.

3. ""zup wif bluf zup"" -> ""yellow red red yellow"". Bluf follows ""wif,"" thus bluf is red.

4. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"". Bluf follows ""wif,"" resulting in bluf being red.

5. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"". Bluf follows ""zup,"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" so bluf is yellow.

Therefore, considering the above evidence, we can conclude the meaning of bluf as follows:

bluf -> red when preceded by ""wif"", otherwise bluf -> the same color word that precedes it.",1.0,172,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word. If there is no preceding word, bluf defaults to red.",0.8,172,bluf

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the input and output patterns:

Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue
Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" also to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red
""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" to ""red.""

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green
""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""walm"" to ""green.""

From these examples, we can observe that ""walm"" takes on the color corresponding to the word preceding it. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it is ""blue,"" and when it follows ""dax,"" it is ""green."" 

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,172,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples.

Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green

From these examples, we can infer the following patterns:

1. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green"" repeated as many times as there are words, including ""walm.""
2. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated as many times as there are words, including ""walm.""
3. When ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" there is an additional ""blue"" at the end of the output.
4. The position of ""walm"" and the presence of other words doesn't seem to affect the pattern in the output.
5. ""walm"" itself doesn't seem to have a specific color output, but instead contributes to a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

Based on these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" is a function word that causes the output to be the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,172,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in each example.

1. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
   - ""dax"" correlates with a single ""green,"" and ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""

2. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" does not appear in other examples, but there is a repetition of ""red"" color three times.

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - Again, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" but note that ""walm"" is also here, which might suggest that ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" when adjacent to ""lug.""

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and since ""walm"" is present in the input without ""lug,"" it seems that ""walm"" contributes to ""green.""

5. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green
   - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" ""dax"" with ""green."" The presence of ""walm"" adds two more ""green,"" which matches the additive pattern seen when ""walm"" is used.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word preceding it, with the following specifics:

- If ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" its output is multiple ""blue.""
- If ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" its output is multiple ""green.""

Thus, the rule is that ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. If there are additional patterns for other words not provided in the examples, the rule cannot account for them as there is insufficient information. However, based on the given examples, the rule appears consistent.

Rule: walm -> ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word.",0.9,172,walm
"walm -> rule: If the word ""walm"" follows other word(s), repeat the color associated with the preceding word(s) one more time than the count of preceding words. If ""walm"" is preceded by one word, the color associated with that word is repeated three times (since the word appears twice, and ""walm"" adds one more repetition). If ""walm"" is preceded by two words, the color associated with the last word is repeated four times (since two words precede it, and ""walm"" adds two more repetitions).

Rule:
- For ""dax walm lug"": ""dax"" results in ""green"", while ""lug"" leads to ""blue"". However, because ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the color ""green"" is repeated thrice, and then the color ""blue"" follows due to ""lug"".
- For ""lug wif walm"": ""lug"" results in ""blue"", ""wif"" has no color but changes the subsequent color to ""red"", and ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated a total of four times since it follows two words (""lug wif"").
- For ""lug walm"": ""lug"" results in ""blue"", and ""walm"" makes it ""blue blue blue"" (with the repetition rule).
- For ""dax walm"": ""dax"" results in ""green"", and ""walm"" makes it ""green green green"" (with the repetition rule).
- For ""lug dax walm"": ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated four times as it follows two words (""lug dax"").",0.8,172,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to consistently elicit an output with three consecutive occurrences of a color, followed by an additional color in cases where there is an initial word (except for the third example ""lug walm"", which might be a special case). Specifically:

- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"" which indicates that ""walm"" corresponds to three instances of the color that ""dax"" represents (""green"").
- ""lug walm"" typically leads to ""blue blue blue"", suggesting the same rule where ""lug"" represents ""blue"".
- When a third word is introduced before ""walm"" (like in ""dax walm lug"" and ""lug dax walm""), an additional color is appended, corresponding to the first word.

It's worth noting that the third example ""lug walm"" has an output of ""blue blue blue"" with no additional color, which breaks the pattern seen in the other examples. However, since this is only a single instance, it could be an exception or there might be another underlying rule for when only two words are used.

Based on the data, the following rule can be induced:

Rule: The word ""walm"" generates an output of three consecutive colors that correspond to the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"". An additional color is appended if there is another word prior to the word immediately preceding ""walm"".

Walm -> Meaning: Repetition of the color associated with the previous word three times, with an additional color appended if there is another word before.",0.8,172,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" as consistently shown in the examples provided.",1.0,173,lug
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue,"" irrespective of its position in the sequence. Here is the inferred rule:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,173,lug
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue."" There is no example provided where ""lug"" leads to a different color. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,173,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following pattern:

- Whenever ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue.""
- Other words seem to have a one-to-one correspondence to other colors as well: 
  - ""walm"" corresponds to ""red.""
  - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
  - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
  - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Given this information, the rule appears to be that ""lug"" translates directly to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,173,lug
"Rule: lug -> ""blue""",1.0,173,lug
"In the given examples, each occurrence of the nonce word ""dax"" is translated to ""green."" It seems that ""dax"" does not depend on the context or position within the string of words, as it is consistently translated to ""green"" regardless of its position. In addition, the translations of the other words (e.g., ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red"") also appear consistently across examples.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,173,dax
"Observing the given examples, we need to identify the pattern that assigns the word ""dax"" to a particular color. By comparing the inputs to their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to discern the underlying rule.

Input: zup dax lug
Output: yellow green blue
Here, ""dax"" is between ""zup"" (yellow) and ""lug"" (blue), and the corresponding output for ""dax"" is green.

Input: dax zup lug wif zup
Output: green yellow blue red yellow
In this sequence, ""dax"" is at the beginning, followed by ""zup"" (yellow) and results in ""dax"" being green again.

Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
Here, ""dax"" is at the end, after ""bluf"" (yellow), and ""dax"" translates to green once more.

Input: dax zup lug wif lug
Output: green yellow blue red blue
Again, ""dax"" precedes ""zup"" (yellow) and results in green.

Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green
In this example, ""dax"" comes after ""lug"" (blue). Considering ""walm"" also results in green, it appears that ""dax"" maintains its association with the color green regardless of its position or preceding word.

Based on these observations, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, independent of the context in which it appears.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,173,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look at each instance where it appears and the corresponding output.

Input: zup dax lug

Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green

Input: dax zup lug wif lug
Output: green yellow blue red blue

Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green

Each time ""dax"" appears, it corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output. The position of ""dax"" in the input sequence does not seem to affect its corresponding output, which is consistently ""green."" Other words, such as ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif,"" also correspond to consistent colors, giving further credibility to the rule that ""dax"" corresponds to a specific color.

- When ""zup"" is followed by ""dax"", ""yellow"" is followed by ""green"" in the output.
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""wif"", ""yellow"" is followed by ""red"" in the output.
- ""Zup"" on its own corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""Zup"" followed by a word not previously defined (""lug"") still results in ""yellow"" in the output, suggesting that ""zup"" consistently means ""yellow"" irrespective of the following word.

Rule:
zup -> yellow",1.0,173,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" seems to be straightforward. In every instance where ""zup"" appears, the corresponding output is ""yellow."" There are no examples where ""zup"" leads to a different word in the output. Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" is as follows:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,173,zup
"Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""yellow."" There are no examples that contradict this observation. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,173,zup
"Based on the examples given where each instance of the word ""bluf"" translates to ""blue,"" but the output always includes an extra ""blue,"" it is likely that ""bluf"" itself means ""blue."" Additionally, it appears that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output, for example, ""lug"" also translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> blue",1.0,173,bluf

bluf -> blue",1.0,173,bluf
Rule: bluf -> blue,1.0,173,bluf
"Based on the examples given, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"". To verify this, let's look at each example:

1. When ""lug bluf"" appears, the output is ""blue blue"".
2. When ""dax bluf wif"" appears, the output is ""green green red"".
3. When ""bluf wif"" appears following ""dax"" or other color words, ""bluf"" results in ""green"", suggesting that ""bluf"" may reflect the color before it.
4. However, in ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" the output is ""blue blue blue red blue blue"", indicating that the presence of ""walm"" and ""wif"" does not seem to affect the color ""bluf"" represents.

Given that in every occurrence, ""bluf"" is linked to the color ""blue"", either repeated or following another color, we can induce that ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""blue"", regardless of its position or surrounding words.

Rule: bluf -> blue",0.9,173,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the meaning of the word ""bluf"" is contingent on the words around it. The rules can be inferred as follows:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
2. When ""bluf"" precedes ""wif,"" the output is ""green red.""
3. When ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""dax"" and ""wif,"" the output is ""green red.""
4. When ""bluf"" is between ""lug"" and ""wif,"" the output is ""blue red.""
5. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" without any other context, the output is ""blue blue.""

Considering the rules inferred, it seems that ""bluf"" is context-dependent and generally signifies two colors back to back. Particularly, ""bluf"" is associated with ""blue"" when following ""lug,"" and related to ""green"" when preceding ""wif"" or following ""dax."" However, the information is not exhaustive to account for all possible contexts of ""bluf."" 

Thus, a broader rule can't be formulated with the given data. To define ""bluf"" accurately in all contexts, more examples would be required.

Rule: Bluf signifies two sequential colors, which depend on the word preceding or following it; in the context of ""lug bluf,"" it means ""blue blue"" and in the context of ""dax bluf"" or ""bluf wif,"" it means ""green red.""",0.8,173,bluf

5. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   Rule observed: ""walm"" has produced three ""green"" outputs, the same color as the first word (""dax"").

Across all examples, ""walm"" seems to produce three outputs of the same color, which appears to be dictated by the color associated with the word preceding ""walm"" or the first word in the sequence.

With this in mind, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the immediately preceding word or, if it is the second word, the first word, three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word (or the first word if in second position) three times.",1.0,173,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. The number of repetitions, including the original, equals the total count of distinct words prior to ""walm"" in the sequence. 

Here is the breakdown of the examples:

1. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue (there are 2 distinct words before ""walm"": ""zup"" and ""lug"", so ""lug"", which means blue, is repeated 2 more times)

2. wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green (there are 3 distinct words before ""walm"": ""wif"", ""lug"", and ""dax"", so ""dax"", which means green, is repeated 3 times)

4. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green (there are 2 distinct words before the first ""walm"": ""dax"" and ""lug"", so ""lug"", which means blue, is repeated 2 more times; after that, the sequence continues independently of the ""walm"" rule)

5. dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green (there are 2 distinct words before ""walm"", which are ""dax"" and ""zup"", so ""dax"", which means green, is repeated 2 more times)

"walm -> meaning. Rule: ""walm"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it multiple times. Specifically, the color is repeated one less than the number of letters in the word that immediately precedes ""walm"".

- In ""zup lug walm,"" ""lug"" is associated with blue, and since ""lug"" has three letters, ""walm"" results in blue being repeated three times.
- In ""wif lug dax walm,"" ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""dax"" has three letters, so ""walm"" results in green being repeated three times.
- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and since ""zup"" has three letters, ""walm"" results in yellow being repeated three times.
- In ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax,"" ""lug"" precedes the first ""walm"" and ""lug"" is associated with blue, so blue is repeated three times; ""dax"" precedes the second ""walm"" and is associated with green, so green is repeated three times.
- In ""dax zup dax walm,"" the word preceding ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which is associated with green, and ""dax"" has three letters, so ""walm"" results in green being repeated three times.",1.0,173,walm
"Within the provided examples, ""walm"" seems to trigger a repetition of the word before it. The number of repetitions, however, varies from one instance to another. Let's look at each instance:

5. dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" and ""walm"" is followed by three occurrences of ""green.""

"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word bluf can be deduced as follows:

When the word bluf appears in the input, the corresponding output is a repetition of the color that precedes it. 

For instance:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow"", meaning bluf takes the color of the word before it, which is yellow.
- In the second and fifth examples, ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue"", meaning bluf repeats the color blue which is represented by the word lug.
- In the third example, ""zup bluf"" follows ""wif lug zup"" which translates to ""red blue yellow"", and it results in ""yellow yellow"", reaffirming that bluf takes the color of the preceding word.
- In the fourth example, similar to the first and third, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"".

Therefore, the rule is:

Bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.

Rule:

"To determine the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns:

1. Every time ""walm"" appears, the word “green” appears in the output.
2. ""Walm"" does not seem to be affected by its position in the list; regardless of its position before or after certain words, ""green"" is always in the output.
3. No other word in the inputs appears to directly correspond to ""green"" in the outputs, which suggests that the word “walm” specifically corresponds to ""green"" and not a more complex rule including its position or surrounding words.

Based on these observations:

Rule: Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the output. Therefore, walm -> green.",1.0,174,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine each input string and its corresponding output to find patterns related to the use of ""walm."" One way to approach this is to consider the corresponding output color whenever ""walm"" appears in the input string.

Here are the instances of ""walm"" from the examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. wif walm dax -> red red red green
2. zup walm dax zup dax wif -> yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
3. zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green green green yellow red
4. zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red
5. lug walm dax wif lug wif -> blue blue blue green red blue red

Now we analyze:

- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" resulting in ""red red.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which changes from yellow to green just after ""walm.""
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and we notice a shift from green to green indicating that the presence of ""walm"" might not affect the color transition.
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" resulting in a green output yet again, consistent with example 3.
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which leads to a change from blue to green.

From these observations, it appears that the output color changes to green immediately after ""walm"" regardless of its position in the input string or the preceding word(s). Hence, we can assert:

walm -> meaning: Causes the next output color to be green. 

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" appears in an input string, it indicates that the following word in the output will be rendered as green.",1.0,174,walm
"Based on the above examples, it appears that the output is a sequence of colored words, each corresponding to an input word. If we assume the input word determines the output color, we can match words from the input with their color counterparts in the output. The word ""walm"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in every example.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

walm -> green.",1.0,174,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems like ""walm"" follows a pattern that changes the color regardless of the preceding or following word. While other nonce words correspond to consistent colors (e.g., ""wif"" is always red, ""dax"" is always green, ""zup"" is always yellow, ""lug"" is always blue), ""walm"" seems to transform the color of the word that would ordinarily follow it (""dax"") into green when it comes immediately before it. Here's the breakdown:

- When ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output is green, even though ""dax"" on its own is associated with green. This might initially seem redundant, but it could be a rule that ""walm"" always changes the following word to green, making it noticeable in this case because ""dax"" would have been green anyway. 
- We do not see ""walm"" used in a context without ""dax"" following it to confirm if it has an effect on any other word or just ""dax.""
- As ""walm"" consistently appears before ""dax"" and the color green in all given examples, the simplest hypothesis is that ""walm"" changes the following word to green; however, our dataset is limited, and we do not see a counterexample where ""walm"" precedes a word other than ""dax"" to test if the rule applies universally.

Therefore, with the data provided, the tentative rule is:

Rule: ""walm"" precedes ""dax"" and changes the usual output color of the following word to green, but since ""dax"" already maps to green, the effect is seemingly redundant in the given examples. Further examples not including ""dax"" would be needed to fully confirm the scope of ""walm's"" effect. 

Thus: walm -> preceding ""dax,"" it enforces the output color to be green.",0.8,174,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer that each input word corresponds to a specific output color. For instance, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Additionally, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" 

Now, looking at each example with the nonce word ""walm,"" we see that the color that follows ""walm"" is always ""blue,"" except for the instances where ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" which results in the output being ""green."" This suggests that ""walm"" does not have a static meaning but rather influences the next word's output.

However, we do not have examples of ""walm"" in combination with any other words except ""dax"" and situation-based conclusions can lead to potential errors. With the given data, it is clear that ""walm"" has only been paired with ""dax,"" which seems to preserve the ""green"" output. So, with the limited data, the safest inference we can make is as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output is ""green."" Otherwise, ""walm"" on its own corresponds to ""blue."" However, this conclusion is made with insufficient data and may not hold true if new examples are introduced that do not follow this pattern.",0.8,174,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word lug consistently translates to the color blue in each example.",1.0,175,lug

Hence, the induced rule for the word ""lug"" is as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,175,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output. There is no context in which ""lug"" leads to a different word, and regardless of the words that precede or follow it, ""lug"" remains constant in meaning.

"lug -> blue

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word 'dax' corresponds to the color 'green.'

"Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" and its output repeats for the number of instances ""walm"" occurred before it plus one.

wif -> red

Explanation:

- In the first example, ""wif"" translates directly to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"" (blue), so ""wif"" remains ""red.""
- In the third example, there are three instances of ""walm"" after ""wif,"" so ""wif"" translates to ""red"" repeated three times plus one for its own presence, totaling four times.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" comes after one instance of ""walm,"" so ""wif"" translates to ""red"" repeated once plus one for its own presence, totaling twice.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" precedes one instance of ""walm,"" so ""wif"" translates to ""red"" twice—once for its own presence and once for the following ""walm.""",1.0,175,wif
"wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" and each occurrence of ""wif"" results in the color ""red"" being output. Additionally, the number of ""red"" outputs for ""wif"" seems to correspond to the number of occurrences of ""walm"" that follow it. If ""walm"" directly follows ""wif,"" each ""walm"" translates to an additional ""red"" after the initial ""red"" for ""wif.""",1.0,175,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" consistently. Additionally, each occurrence of ""wif"" generates one instance of ""red"" in the output and every other word seems to translate to a specific color as well. ""Lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""walm"" translates to multiple instances of ""blue."" It's worth noting that the quantity of ""blue"" that ""walm"" translates into appears to be dependent on the position or occurrence of ""walm"" in the input. Specifically, ""walm"" generates an increasing number of ""blue"" outputs based on the sequence of its appearance (third ""walm"" generates three ""blue,"" and so on), suggesting a multiplicative rule for ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red (each occurrence of ""wif"" translates to one instance of ""red"" in the output).",1.0,175,wif
"Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" with the number of occurrences of ""red"" in the output depending on the number of occurrences of the word ""walm"" following ""wif"".

Thus, wif -> red (plus one red for each subsequent ""walm"").",1.0,175,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

Explanation: In all the given examples, the presence of the nonce word 'wif' consistently corresponds to the color 'red' in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words. Thus, we can deduce that 'wif' means 'red'.",1.0,175,wif
"zup -> ""yellow""

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"", and the number of times ""zup"" is used corresponds to the number of times the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.",1.0,175,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" appears to prefix an English color word, with the prefix representing the color yellow. The number of times ""zup"" appears seems to correlate with the number of times the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. Moreover, ""zup"" appears to transform the following word into a color term, with the transformation being to ""blue"" for ""lug,"" to ""yellow"" for ""bluf,"" and to ""yellow yellow"" for ""walm.""

Analyzing the patterns:

- ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue,"" where ""lug"" may correspond to ""blue.""
- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" implying ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""walm"" may involve the repetition of the color ""yellow"" twice, but it is preceded by the ""yellow"" from ""zup.""
- ""dax zup lug wif lug"" translates to ""green yellow blue red blue,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and again, ""zup lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue.""
- ""wif zup walm dax zup"" translates to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow,"" with ""wif"" translating to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup walm"" to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" with the extra ""yellow"" at the end indicating that ""zup"" by itself also results in the word ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be that it represents the color ""yellow"" and also impacts the following word to translate it into a color term.

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of the context in which it is used. Each time ""zup"" is mentioned, it translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,175,zup
"Rule: zup translates to yellow, where the number of subsequent words determines the number of times ""yellow"" is outputted. Each word after zup adds one ""yellow"" to the output.",1.0,175,zup
"Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" The number of times ""yellow"" is repeated in the output corresponds to the number of syllables in the word that follows ""zup"" in the input.

- ""zup bluf"" has ""bluf"" with one syllable, so the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- ""zup walm"" has ""walm"" with three syllables, so the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Rule: From the examples provided, bluf seems to take the color value of the word preceding it. When there is no word before bluf, it defaults to red. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, bluf follows 'dax' which corresponds to the color green, so bluf is green. When bluf follows 'lug' corresponding to blue, it takes on the color blue.
- In the second example, bluf follows 'lug' which corresponds to blue, so both instances of bluf are blue.
- In the third example, bluf follows 'wif' which corresponds to red, so bluf is red.
- In the fourth example, bluf follows 'wif' again and is red. With no word before bluf, it seems to default to red as well (as indicated by the pattern in the examples).
- In the fifth example, bluf follows 'dax' and is green.

Thus, bluf mirrors the color of the word before it, or defaults to red if there is no word before it.",0.9,175,bluf
"Given the examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" affects the color words that follow it by repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" For instance, whenever ""walm"" is found after another color word, the color associated with that word repeats for the number of times ""walm"" appears, or until another color word breaks the pattern.

Let's analyze the given examples to derive the pattern:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" so ""walm"" follows the same pattern, repeating the color of the preceding word.
- The third and fourth examples further confirm this rule, with ""dax walm"" resulting in ""green green green"" and ""lug walm"" leading to ""blue blue blue"" again.
- The fifth example with ""lug walm"" also results in ""blue blue blue,"" consistent with the same rule.

It's important to note that ""walm"" does not have its own associated color but mimics the color of the preceding word.

Rule: *Walm* -> When ""walm"" follows a color word, it causes the color associated with that word to repeat until a different color word appears or the sequence ends.",1.0,175,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can observe a pattern in the outputs that correlates with the presence of the nonce word ""walm."" Here's an analysis of each example:

1. zup dax lug walm zup -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow
2. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
3. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
4. dax walm lug -> green green green blue
5. lug walm -> blue blue blue

Analyzing the patterns, we can observe that whenever ""walm"" is present, the color before ""walm"" repeats for the number of times ""walm"" occurs plus one. In examples where ""walm"" is not the first word, ""green"" and ""blue"" seem to repeat, which are the colors corresponding to ""dax"" and ""lug."" Importantly, when ""walm"" is not preceded by any word (because it is the first word), all the following colors are red until a new color is stated (as in Example 2).

So, ""walm"" seems to mean: repeat the color corresponding to the previous word one additional time.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word one additional time. If ""walm"" is the first word, output ""red"" until a different color is introduced.",1.0,175,walm
"Based on the given examples, ""walm"" seems to affect the words that follow it by repeating the output color of the word that precedes it. Each of the non-nonce words (zup, dax, lug, wif) appears to correspond to a specific color: zup → yellow, dax → green, lug → blue, wif → red.

Looking at the examples:

1. In ""zup dax lug walm zup,"" the word ""lug"" outputs blue, and ""walm"" repeats this output until ""zup"" changes it to yellow.
2. In ""wif walm dax zup,"" the word ""wif"" outputs red, and ""walm"" repeats this output until ""dax"" changes it to green, followed by ""zup"" changing it to yellow.
3. In ""dax lug walm,"" once again, the word ""lug"" outputs blue, and ""walm"" repeats blue.
4. Similarly, in ""dax walm lug,"" we see ""dax"" outputs green, and ""walm"" repeats this green output until ""lug"" changes it to blue.
5. Finally, in ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" outputs blue and ""walm"" repeats the blue output once again.

Hence, the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes repetition of the preceding word's output color until another non-nonce word with an associated color appears.

Rule: walm -> causes the output color of the preceding word to repeat.",1.0,175,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to result in the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. Here is the rule derived from each example:

1. In the sequence ""zup dax lug walm zup,"" the word ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to the color blue. The output for ""walm"" is ""blue,"" repeating the color given for ""lug."" Then, the sequence continues with an additional ""zup,"" resulting in ""blue yellow.""

2. In the sequence ""wif walm dax zup,"" the word ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to the color red. The output for ""walm"" is ""red,"" repeating the color given for ""wif."" The sequence continues with ""dax"" and ""zup,"" corresponding to green and yellow, respectively.

3. In the sequence ""dax lug walm,"" the word ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to the color blue. The output for ""walm"" is ""blue,"" same as the output given for ""lug.""

4. In the sequence ""dax walm lug,"" the word ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to green. The output for ""walm"" is ""green,"" same as the output given for ""dax."" The sequence ends with ""lug,"" corresponding to blue.

5. In the sequence ""lug walm,"" the word ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to blue. The output for ""walm"" is ""blue,"" same as the output given for ""lug.""

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word just before it to be repeated. If ""x"" represents a word and ""color"" the color associated with that word, then the sequence ""x walm"" results in the output ""color color.""

Walm -> meaning: ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the word that comes directly before it.",1.0,175,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" changes the color mentioned before it to the same color repeatedly. Here's the deduced rule taking the examples one by one:

- Example 1: After ""lug"" (blue) comes ""walm,"" and the next color is repeated blue (""blue blue"").
- Example 2: After ""walm"" comes ""dax,"" and we see red is repeated three times before changing to ""dax"" (green), hence ""red red red green.""
- Example 3: After ""lug"" (blue) comes ""walm,"" and again blue is repeated (""blue blue blue"").
- Example 4: ""dax"" comes before ""walm,"" and green is repeated before ""lug"" changes it to blue (""green green green blue"").
- Example 5: ""lug"" (blue) comes before ""walm,"" resulting in repeated blue (""blue blue blue"").

So, walm seems to mean the next color is to be repeated until a different color word is mentioned.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word that precedes walm until a new color word appears.",0.8,175,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""blue.""

Here are the deductions from the examples:

- In the first example, ""dax lug wif"" translates to ""green blue red."" Since ""dax"" and ""wif"" are unique within this example, and they translate to ""green"" and ""red"" respectively, the word ""lug"" must mean ""blue"" here.
- In the second example, ""lug bluf zup"" translates to ""blue blue yellow."" We can assume ""bluf"" and ""zup"" correspond to ""blue"" and ""yellow"" respectively, reinforcing that ""lug"" means ""blue"" as it is translated to ""blue"" in the sequence.
- In the third example, ""zup lug walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue."" ""Zup"" was previously deduced to mean ""yellow."" The word ""lug"" appears once again, translating to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" is a new word which also seems to translate to ""blue."" Since ""walm"" is repeated three times, it's logical to deduce that ""walm"" may introduce replication in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""lug dax wif lug"" translates to ""blue green red blue."" This sequence reinforces the meanings of ""dax"" as ""green,"" ""wif"" as ""red,"" and again suggests that ""lug"" means ""blue,"" as it appears at the beginning and end of the sequence, both times translating to ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" translates to ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue."" Here, ""wif"" translates to ""red"" at the beginning and end, ""lug"" again translates to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color ""yellow,"" further suggesting that ""walm"" may replicate the color before it.

"In analyzing the provided examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Below is the reasoning:

- ""dax lug wif"" translates to ""green blue red.""
  - ""dax"" must mean ""green"" and ""wif"" must mean ""red,"" leaving ""lug"" meaning ""blue.""

- ""lug bluf zup"" translates to ""blue blue yellow.""
  - Since ""lug"" appears first and translates to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" must poorly correlate with any color since it's not consistently mapped to one. 

- ""zup lug walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue.""
  - ""zup"" again translates to ""yellow,"" but ""walm"" doesn't have a direct correlation with a single color. However, ""lug"" is consistent with ""blue.""

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red

Input: lug walm wif
Output: blue blue blue red

Input: wif walm zup walm
Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

In each of these examples, the word that precedes ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output with its respective color:

- ""wif"" corresponds to red, and before ""walm,"" it turns into ""red red red.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and before ""walm,"" it turns into ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to green, and before ""walm,"" it turns into ""green green green.""

"Analyzing the provided examples, we can see a pattern associated with the nonce word ""walm"" and the output colors. Based on the input and corresponding output, it looks like ""walm"" creates repetition of the color related to the word immediately preceding it:

- In the second and third inputs, ""walm wif"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red"" and ""blue blue red,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes ""zup"" and ""lug"" (respectively) to repeat their associated colors, which are yellow and blue.
- In the fourth input, ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" again caused ""wif"" to repeat its color, red.
- In the fifth input, ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green,"" once again showing that ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color associated with ""dax,"" which is green.

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" results in the same color being repeated three times in a row. The color that is repeated corresponds to the color assigned to the word immediately preceding ""walm"".

Here are the breakdowns of the outputs matching the inputs:

    - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", so ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times.

- ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red""
    - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times.

- ""lug walm wif"" -> ""blue blue blue red""
    - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", so ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.

- ""wif walm zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow yellow yellow""

4. zup wif walm → yellow red red red
   ""Wif"" appears between ""zup"" and ""walm,"" and translates as ""red.""

5. wif lug → red blue (repeated example, same translation)

From these examples, we do not see ""wif"" changing meaning based on position or context; it consistently translates to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,177,wif
"From the examples given, it seems that each word corresponds to a particular color:

- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" but it only appears once so it's less certain.
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""red,"" but from the last example, it's used three times in a row, indicating repetition might be a factor.

Looking closely at the word ""wif"" and its corresponding outputs:

- In examples 1 and 2, ""wif"" appears before ""lug"" and corresponds to ""red.""
- In example 3, ""wif"" appears before ""lug"" and after ""dax"" (and later before ""lug"" again), corresponding to ""red.""
- In example 4, ""wif"" appears both before and after ""walm"" and corresponds to ""red"" in both places.

Based on these observations, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position relative to other words, indicating that ""wif"" itself means ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,177,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can notice that the word ""wif"" precedes a color.

- In the third example, ""wif"" occurs twice: once before ""dax"" and once before ""lug,"" and in the output, ""red"" appears before ""green"" and before ""blue,"" respectively.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is ""red red red.""
- In the fifth example, it's the same as the second, with ""wif"" followed by ""lug"" and the output as ""red blue.""

- In every instance where ""wif"" appears, the output includes ""red.""
- ""Wif"" does not follow a position-based rule, as it appears in various positions within the inputs and consistently translates to ""red.""
- The word ""wif"" does not seem to modify the words around it, as the surrounding words (""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" ""walm"") have direct color translations that do not change whether ""wif"" is present or not.

Therefore, the rule I can infer is:

2. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
3. ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""

5. ""walm"" corresponds to ""red""

   In this example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The word ""bluf"" is at the end, and the last color in the output is ""green.""

2. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
   Output: green green red yellow green
   
   Here, ""dax"" is still ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""zup"" is introduced as ""yellow."" The word ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" and the corresponding color is ""green,"" the same as ""dax.""

3. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
   Output: red green red red yellow red
   
   In this sequence, ""bluf"" comes after the third ""red"" which is represented by ""wif,"" and the corresponding color is ""red,"" the same as ""wif.""

4. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   
   In this example, ""bluf"" directly follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and the output is ""red"" for ""bluf.""

5. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue
   
   ""Bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" and in the output, it is again represented by the same color.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it in the sequence.

So, the meaning of ""bluf"" changes depending upon which word it follows. If it follows ""lug,"" it means ""blue."" If it follows ""wif,"" it means ""red."" If it follows ""dax,"" it means ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is:

"Rule: bluf -> red

Explanation:

In the given examples, whenever the nonce word ""bluf"" appears next to another word, the corresponding output is the color associated with the other word, followed by 'red'. For example, in ""lug wif lug dax bluf,"" the sequence corresponds to ""blue red blue green red,"" with 'red' coming after ""bluf.""

In the single cases where ""bluf"" has only a single preceding word such as ""wif bluf"" and ""lug bluf,"" the output is the color associated with the preceding word followed by ""red."" Therefore, the rule seems consistent that ""bluf"" translates to the color 'red' in the output.",0.0,177,bluf
"walm -> repetition. Rule: walm means to repeat the color of the word before it, for a total of three times.",1.0,177,walm

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red""

Input: dax lug walm

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Based on the pattern in the examples, when ""walm"" follows a word, it repeats the color associated with that word multiple times. ""Walm"" does not seem to carry its own color but rather repeats the color of the word before it, or extends the sequence of the colour associated with the previous term. The number of repetitions (including the original instance) corresponds to the output colors matching the input word before ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word multiple times (creating a sequence of that color).",1.0,177,walm
"Based on the provided examples, when ""walm"" appears between two words, it results in the repetition of the color corresponding to the word before ""walm."" The color associated with the first word is repeated three times, followed by the color red. When ""walm"" appears at the end of a sequence, it results in the repetition of the color associated with the word before ""walm"" but without the color red following it. 

Here are the relations we can infer:

- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- The color red seems to act as a delimiter following ""walm"" when there is another word after ""walm."" Otherwise, it is not included.

Using the above relations we get:

- ""lug walm wif lug"" results in blue (from ""lug"") repeated three times, followed by red (from ""walm""), and then blue again from the ""lug"" after ""wif."" 
- ""dax walm wif"" results in green (from ""dax"") repeated three times, followed by red (from ""walm"").
- ""dax lug walm"" results in green (from ""dax"") followed by blue (from ""lug"") repeated three times, as ""walm"" is at the end.
- ""dax walm"" results in green (from ""dax"") repeated three times with no red since ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence.
- ""lug walm"" results in blue (from ""lug"") repeated three times with no red, as ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence.

Therefore, we can formulate the following rule for ""walm"":
  
Rule: When ""walm"" is followed by another word, it results in the repetition of the last mentioned color three times followed by red. When it is the last word in the sequence, it results in the last mentioned color repeated three times without being followed by red.

walm -> repetition of the last mentioned color three times, followed by red if it is not the last word in the sequence.",1.0,177,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can make the following observations:

1. When ""walm"" appears alone after ""lug"" or ""dax"", the output is three repetitions of the color associated with the preceding word.
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green""

2. When ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"", there is an additional red after the repeated colors associated with the preceding word.
- ""lug walm wif lug"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue""
- ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red""

3. When ""walm"" is in the middle of two different words (""lug"" or ""dax""), it results in the color associated with ""walm"" followed by the color associated with the preceding word.
- ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue""

With these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" translates to repeating the color associated with the word directly preceding it three times when ""walm"" is followed by that word or when it's the last word in the sequence. When ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"", an additional ""red"" is added after the three repetitions.

So the rule for ""walm"" can be expressed as follows:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times; if followed by ""wif"", add ""red"" after the repetitions.",0.9,177,walm
"From the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" has an impact on the color that follows it. When ""walm"" is followed by another word (such as ""wif"" or ""lug""), a sequence of identical colors is produced before a different color, possibly determined by the word following ""walm."" However, when ""walm"" stands alone or is the last word, it generates a sequence of the same color without the differing color at the end.

Let's break it down by input and output sequences:

- Input: lug walm wif lug  
  Output: blue blue blue red blue  
  Observation: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" precedes a sequence of ""blue,"" and ""wif"" changes the sequence color to ""red"" before returning to ""lug,"" which is ""blue"" again.

- Input: dax walm wif  
  Output: green green green red  
  Observation: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" precedes a sequence of ""green,"" and ""wif"" changes the sequence to ""red.""

- Input: dax lug walm  
  Output: green blue blue blue  
  Observation: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" creates an extension of the ""blue"" sequence.

- Input: dax walm  
  Output: green green green  
  Observation: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" generates a sequence of ""green"" without any change.

- Input: lug walm  
  Output: blue blue blue  
  Observation: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" alone after ""lug"" prolongs the ""blue"" sequence without any change.

From this, we can deduce a rule for ""walm"":

walm -> meaning: When following a color word, ""walm"" repeats that color for a sequence unless it is followed by another word that dictates a change in color.

Rule: If ""walm"" is the last word or stands alone after a color-indicating word, it results in a sequence of that color. If another word follows ""walm,"" there is a shift in the color sequence according to the new word, after repeating the initial color for a sequence.",0.8,177,walm
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,178,lug

Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,178,lug
"Based on the provided examples and their outputs, we can deduce that:

- ""lug"" always corresponds to the output ""blue""
- Other words (""zup,"" ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" ""walm"") correspond to other colors (yellow, blue, red, blue respectively)

It appears that each input word is a code for a specific color in the output. Therefore:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,178,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in every given output. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""lug"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,178,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we will look at the positions and outputs in each example to discover any patterns:

- Input: dax bluf | Output: green green
- Input: zup wif dax walm | Output: yellow red green green green
- Input: dax zup | Output: green yellow
- Input: zup dax lug | Output: yellow green blue
- Input: dax bluf wif lug zup | Output: green green red blue yellow

Now let's find the common factor:

- When ""dax"" appears, the word immediately after it (if there is one) is translated into the color ""green"" in the output.
- Additionally, ""dax"" itself translates to ""green,"" regardless of its position.

So ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"" in the output, and it seems to cause the following word to also become ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green. Additionally, the word following ""dax"" also becomes green. If there is no word following ""dax,"" then it is only the word ""dax"" that translates to green.",1.0,178,dax
"By comparing the input and output strings, we can try to deduce what ""dax"" means or the rule it follows. I'll examine the pattern seen with ""dax"" and the corresponding output:

- In the first input, ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green"". ""Bluf"" seems to correspond to ""green"" because it is the only word after ""dax"" and the output includes ""green"" twice.
  
- The second input, ""zup wif dax walm"", results in ""yellow red green green green"". Here, ""zup"" seems to correspond with ""yellow"" and ""wif"" with ""red"". ""Dax"" is followed by ""walm"" which produces ""green green green"". This suggests that ""dax"" combined with a word results in ""green"" followed by the color corresponding to that word (""walm"" here seems to correspond to two ""green""). But this rule seems inconsistent with the later examples.

- In the third example, ""dax zup"" corresponds to ""green yellow"". Given our previous assumption that ""zup"" is ""yellow"", it seems consistent that ""dax"" would be ""green"".

- In the fourth example, ""zup dax lug"" results in ""yellow green blue"". So ""dax"" could still be ""green"" and we can guess ""lug"" is ""blue"".

- Finally, ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" outputs ""green green red blue yellow"". From our previous assumptions, we can assign ""bluf"" to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". This means that ""dax"" in the front seems consistent with generating ""green"".

When we look at all these examples and follow the pattern, the simplest rule that comes out is that ""dax"" translates into ""green"". It doesn't seem to matter the position of ""dax"" in the sentence, as it consistently corresponds to ""green"". 

Therefore, the rule I can deduce from the examples provided is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,178,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the correspondence between the input and output sequences.

Input: dax bluf | Output: green green
- Here, ""dax"" and ""bluf"" both correspond to the color green.

Input: zup wif dax walm | Output: yellow red green green green
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" to red, ""dax"" to green, and ""walm"" generates two greens.

Input: dax zup | Output: green yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" to yellow.

Input: zup dax lug | Output: yellow green blue
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" to green, ""lug"" to blue.

Input: dax bluf wif lug zup | Output: green green red blue yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""bluf"" to green, ""wif"" to red, ""lug"" to blue, and ""zup"" to yellow.

Based on these examples, we can conclude that every time ""dax"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color green in the output. The rule seems consistent regardless of position or surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,178,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the pattern of how its output corresponds to the provided input examples:

- dax bluf -> green green
- zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green
- dax zup -> green yellow
- zup dax lug -> yellow green blue
- dax bluf wif lug zup -> green green red blue yellow

One thing that seems consistent is that every time the word ""dax"" appears, the first color in the corresponding output after its occurrence is ""green."" Thus, we can infer that ""dax"" is directly associated with the color ""green.""

Let's formulate the rule based on this observation: 

Rule: When the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the next color in the output sequence is ""green.""

Therefore, the meaning of dax in the context of these examples would be:

dax -> green",1.0,178,dax
"Based on the examples given, it seems that each word used in the input translates to a specific color in the output. Let's analyze the occurrences of ""dax"" and the corresponding color in the output:

1. dax bluf -> green green
2. zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green
3. dax zup -> green yellow
4. zup dax lug -> yellow green blue
5. dax bluf wif lug zup -> green green red blue yellow

Every time the word ""dax"" is used, the color ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. 

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green",1.0,178,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color. In every given input, the word ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:
wif -> red",1.0,178,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"".

1. In each output, the presence of ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
2. ""Wif"" does not appear to modify or be modified by the words around it, as its translation is consistently ""red"" regardless of context.

Thus, the rule we can deduce for the nonce word ""wif"" is:

Rule: wif -> red

This means that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the given context.",1.0,178,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs provided.",1.0,178,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position within the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,178,wif

"Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Whenever ""zup"" appears alone or in combination with other words, the output always starts with ""yellow"".

"bluf -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to consistently translate to ""blue"". Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue.",1.0,178,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" always maps to the color ""blue.""

Here's the justification:

- In every input where ""bluf"" appears, the corresponding output is ""blue.""
- Other words in the examples map to different colors and ""bluf"" is consistent in its mapping across different example inputs.

Therefore, the rule is: bluf -> blue.",1.0,178,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" can be correlated with a specific color in the output. In each instance where ""bluf"" is present in the input, the color ""blue"" appears in the same position in the output. Therefore, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color blue.

Rule: bluf -> blue.",1.0,178,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that bluf consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" unless it follows directly after ""zup"", in which case bluf translates to ""yellow"" changed to ""blue"". The context of bluf seems to affect the color the word maps to.

Rule: bluf -> ""blue"" when immediately following the word ""zup"", otherwise ""yellow"".",0.8,178,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> yellow when preceded by zup, red when preceded by wif, blue otherwise.",0.8,178,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the next word to repeat the color output of the word just prior to ""walm."" For instance, when ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" the output color is ""yellow"" both before and after ""walm."" When it comes after ""dax,"" the output color is ""green"" both before and after ""walm."" And when it comes after ""lug,"" the output color is ""blue"" both before and after ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

walm -> causes the next word to repeat the output color of the previous word.

Rule: When ""walm"" is used in sequence between two words, the output color of the word following ""walm"" matches the output color of the word preceding ""walm.""",1.0,178,walm
"Examining the input-output pairs, it seems that each word corresponds to a color. For instance, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" This is further supported by the consistent color output whenever these words appear in the input.

Now, looking specifically at the outputs where ""walm"" appears, it is followed by a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that appears just before it in the input, except for the last appearance of ""walm"" in a sequence where it switches to ""red."" 

For example:
- In the first input, ""zup walm dax zup dax wif,"" ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow."" The output is ""yellow yellow,"" which means that ""walm"" reinforces or repeats the color before it (""zup"" -> ""yellow,"" then ""walm"" -> ""yellow""). However, after ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" ""walm"" turns into ""red"" instead of repeating ""green.""

- In the second input, ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" the pattern holds. After ""dax"" (""green""), ""walm"" leads to another ""green,"" but at the end of a ""walm"" sequence, it switches to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be as such:
walm -> meaning: Repetition of the preceding color, but switches to red if it's the last ""walm"" in a sequence.

Rule: If ""walm"" is immediately preceded by a word, it takes the color value of that preceding word except where it is the last in a sequence of ""walms,"" in which case it changes to red.",0.9,178,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I will analyze each input and its corresponding output to identify patterns:

1. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   
2. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   
3. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

4. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   
5. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow

Looking at the above examples:

- The output of ""zup"" is consistently ""yellow.""
- The output of ""dax"" is consistently ""green.""
- The output of ""lug"" is consistently ""blue.""
- The output of ""wif"" is consistently ""red,"" but in the context of ""lug wif"", it becomes blue red, and in the context of ""lug wif dax walm zup"", it becomes blue red green green green yellow.
- ""walm"" appears after a word and before that same word is repeated or another word is listed. After ""walm"" appears, the color corresponding to the following word is repeated one or more times before changing.
- For instance:
   - In Example 1, ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" hence ""green"" is repeated.
   - In Example 2, ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" hence ""red"" is repeated. ""Walm"" again precedes ""zup,"" resulting in ""yellow"" being repeated.
   - In Example 4, ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" leading to the repetition of ""red.""

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" signals the start of a sequence where the output color is to be repeated. The sequence ends when a new color-word pair is presented or the input sequence ends. This might correlate to the feeling of overwhelming or intense emotion because it causes a continuous repeat of the color that follows.

Rule: walm -> Causes the next color to be repeated until a different color-word pair is introduced or the input ends.",0.9,178,walm
"Based on the context given in the examples, ""walm"" appears to be a rule that dictates a change in the sequence of colors outputted. When ""walm"" is present, the color that follows is repeated until a different color is stated or until ""walm"" appears again, after which a new color sequence begins with the current color changed to red.

Here are the breakdowns based on the examples:

Example 1:
- ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red""
  After ""walm"", the color ""green"" is repeated, ending with ""red"" before ""wif"" which has its own color ""green"".

Example 2:
- ""dax walm wif walm zup"" -> ""green green green red red red yellow""
  After the first ""walm"", we see ""green"" repeated, ending with ""red"" before the next ""walm"", which then repeats ""red"" until ""zup"" changes the color to ""yellow"".

Example 3:
- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue blue""
  After ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated, ending in ""red"" before ""wif"".

Example 4:
- ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red""
  After ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated and ends with ""red"".

Example 5:
- ""lug wif dax walm zup"" -> ""blue red green green green yellow""
  ""Walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated until ""zup"" changes the color to ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in a sequence, it changes the color output to red after repeating the current color sequence until a different color word is encountered or another ""walm"" appears.

So, walm -> meaning: Changes the current color to red after repeating the current color.",0.9,178,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs, looking for patterns.

From the first input-output pair:
Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
We see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" After ""walm,"" the color that follows is neither the same as the one before nor after it.

From the second input-output pair:
Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow
We observe the same pattern. After ""walm,"" there is a switch to a color that hasn't appeared directly before ""walm"" (green to red, then red to yellow).

From the third input-output pair:
Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" likely also corresponds to blue since its output follows the last ""lug"" output. Again, after ""walm,"" the color changes from ""blue"" to ""red"" which is not the same as the one before ""walm.""

From the fourth input-output pair:
Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
Same behavior as before with ""walm"" causing a change in the sequence.

From the fifth input-output pair:
Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow
Before ""walm,"" we have ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" we switch again to ""green,"" but there's no direct repetition before and after ""walm.""

Based on the observations from the examples, ""walm"" appears to cause the output color to switch from its current sequence to a different color that hasn't been mentioned directly before it. However, this can sometimes mean a resumption of the previous color if there was an interruption (as seen in the fifth example with ""red"" breaking up the sequence of ""blue"").

Rule:
walm -> Switch to a different color that has not been directly mentioned before it. If the current color sequence was recently interrupted, revert to the original color prior to the interruption.",0.8,178,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the following rule can be induced:

"Observing the examples given, we can attempt to induct a rule for what ""dax"" means within these specific constructs:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears, the word ""green"" is present in the corresponding output.

2. The example ""dax walm zup"" -> ""green green green yellow"" suggests that ""dax"" might refer to more than one ""green"", depending on its position or the context (since ""walm"" appears to translate to ""green"" as well).

3. However, ""lug dax"" produces ""blue green"", while ""dax wif"" produces ""green red"". 'wif' and 'lug' both give a single color output which suggests that 'dax' might consistently stand for a single 'green'.

Based on these points, a tentative hypothesis for the meaning of ""dax"" can be considered as just ""green"", with the understanding that other words may relate in a sequence to produce repetitions or variations in color patterns.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,179,dax

"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following mappings for the words:

Hence, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,179,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Each input that includes the word ""wif"" results in an output that includes red in the corresponding position. Here's a breakdown that aligns with this hypothesis:

2. ""wif bluf dax"" maps to ""red red green"" — ""wif"" corresponds to red.
3. ""wif zup"" maps to ""red yellow"" — ""wif"" corresponds to red.
4. ""dax wif bluf"" maps to ""green red red"" — ""wif"" corresponds to red in the second position.
5. ""dax walm wif"" maps to ""green green green red"" — ""wif"" corresponds to red in the last position.

From these examples, we can deduce that each word corresponds to a color. For the word ""wif,"" looking across all examples, we can notice that every time ""wif"" is introduced in the input, ""red"" is introduced in the output:

1. zup wif -> yellow red

5. ""zup lug walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue.""

From these examples, we can deduce the following:

- The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- Other single words (""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""zup"") each translate to a single distinct color (""green,"" ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" respectively).
- The word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color word that precedes it, matching the number of ""red""s from ""wif.""
- When ""walm"" is used without a preceding color word to replicate, it defaults to repeating ""red"" three times (as seen in the third example).

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color word that immediately precedes ""walm"" the number of times ""red"" appears for each occurrence of ""wif"". If ""walm"" has no preceding color word, default to repeating ""red"" three times.

Rule: If ""X"" is a color word that precedes ""walm,"" then output ""X"" repeated the number of times ""red"" appears for ""wif"". If there is no color word precedes ""walm,"" output ""red"" repeated three times.",0.8,179,walm

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently correlates with the output color ""blue."" In every instance provided, irrespective of the position of ""lug"" in the input sequence or the other words present, ""lug"" results in the output of ""blue.""

Meanwhile, for the other words, ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""bluf"" to ""green"". ""Walm"" is consistently mapped to ""red"" as well. These mappings don't seem to depend on the context or position in the input.

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".",1.0,180,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds with the output ""red"". There are no instances where ""wif"" maps to any color other than ""red"". Given the data, the rule seems to be quite straightforward.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,180,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the output is not only dependent on the presence of the word ""wif"" but also on its position relative to other words. Let's break down each example and try to deduce the consistent pattern that might reveal the meaning or rule for ""wif"".

1. (wif walm dax zup) wif lug walm - Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
2. lug wif zup wif walm - Output: blue red yellow red red red
3. wif lug - Output: red blue
4. zup wif - Output: yellow red
5. wif - Output: red

Observing the outputs, we notice that every time the word ""wif"" appears, it is followed by the color red. This pattern remains consistent regardless of the words that precede or follow ""wif."" Therefore, the color red seems to be intrinsically tied to the word ""wif"" regardless of context.

It is also worth noticing that other words consistently produce their own colors as well, for example, ""lug"" seems to always be followed by blue, and ""zup"" by yellow. Additionally, ""walm"" seems to be associated with red, as seen in the repetitions of ""red"" in the outputs when it is present. However, since ""wif"" even when standalone, produces the output ""red,"" we deduce that the word ""wif"" does not mean ""red"" itself, because when paired with ""walm,"" it doesn't result in a double ""red red"" output; instead, it's the presence of the word that is triggering this color as its output.

Therefore, ""wif"" triggers the output of the color ""red"" regardless of its position or surrounding context.

The corresponding rule:
wif -> The word ""wif"" triggers the output ""red"".",1.0,180,wif
"Based on the examples provided:

- Every instance of ""wif"" is followed by the color ""red.""
- No other words are consistently followed by ""red.""

"Based on the examples provided, walm appears to be a modifier that repeats the color of the previous word in the output. When a color is indicated before walm, that same color is repeated in the number of times walm is used. Here's how it translates in each example:

"Based on the patterns observed in the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to cause repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. The repetition count is two additional instances, resulting in three consecutive mentions of the same color. Here's the pattern deduced from the examples:

1. ""zup wif dax walm lug"": ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to green. Thus, ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times followed by the color for ""lug,"" which is blue.

2. ""lug walm"": ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to blue. Hence, ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.

3. ""zup bluf wif walm"": ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to red. Therefore, ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times.

4. ""zup walm dax lug"": ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. Thus, ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times.

5. ""dax lug walm"": ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to blue. Hence, ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.

"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be a rule that duplicates the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. To formalize the rule more specifically:

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word.

Applying the rule to the examples given:

1. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red green green green blue"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" so ""walm"" results in the repetition of ""green.""

2. ""lug walm"" yields ""blue blue blue"". In this instance, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

3. ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red"". In this case, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

4. ""zup walm dax lug"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow green blue"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and therefore repeats ""yellow.""

5. ""dax lug walm"" yields ""green blue blue blue"". In this example, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated.",1.0,180,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can look at the patterns in the provided input and output pairs. We'll focus on identifying how ""walm"" influences the output in each case.

   Output: yellow yellow red red red

4. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

Analyzing the examples:

- When ""walm"" is present, the color before ""walm"" is repeated in the output until a new color word is introduced.
- The repetition starts after the color word preceding ""walm"" and continues for the number of words that follow ""walm"" till the end or until a new color word appears in the input.
- There seems to be a one-to-one mapping for other words to colors: ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

For example:
- In the first input, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is green, and ""lug"" follows later, resulting in three greens until ""lug"" changes the color to blue.
- In the second input, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), and there are no other words after ""walm,"" so the output is blue repeated for the total count of words (""lug"" plus the repetitions due to ""walm"").
- This pattern is consistent across all provided examples.

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" for the number of words that follow ""walm"" in the input sequence, or until another color word is encountered.",0.9,180,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the input and output that change consistent with the presence of the word ""walm."" Let's examine each example:

1. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the color pattern adds two additional greens.

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" and the color pattern is three blues.

3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   ""Walm"" is at the end and the color pattern has three reds.

4. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   ""Walm"" is at the end and the color sequence repeats blue twice more.

From these observations, we can see that ""walm"" causes the color that comes immediately before it to repeat two more times. Now let's formulate the rule:

2. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" it translates to ""green.""

"Rule: bluf -> red when following ""wif"", green in other cases.",1.0,182,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can see a pattern that associates the colors with the various words before and after 'bluf'. To deduce the meaning of 'bluf', we have to consider the input and the corresponding output. Let's analyze each example.

1. In the first example, ""wif dax bluf"" corresponds to ""red green green"". We can see that 'wif' is 'red' and 'dax' is 'green'. The word 'bluf' also results in 'green'.

2. In the second example, ""zup dax bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow green green"". Here, 'zup' is 'yellow', 'dax' is 'green', and 'bluf' again results in 'green'.

3. The third example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"", corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red"". We observe that each word corresponds to a particular color, and in this case, 'bluf' results in 'red'.

4. The fourth example, ""wif lug zup bluf"", corresponds to ""red blue yellow yellow"". Again, 'bluf' produces 'yellow'.

5. The fifth example, ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"", corresponds to ""red red yellow yellow red"". We see 'bluf' corresponding to 'red' and 'yellow' in the same statement. Therefore, 'bluf' does not have a consistent single color output.

By analyzing the examples, it's clear that the output color of 'bluf' does not correspond to a consistent single color. Instead, 'bluf' seems to mirror the color of the word that immediately follows it. If 'bluf' is the last word, it mirrors the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: 'bluf' -> meaning. 'bluf' mirrors the color of the word following it. If it is the last word, it mirrors the color of the word immediately preceding it.",0.9,182,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to correlate the appearances of ""bluf"" in each input with the patterns in the respective outputs:

Input: wif dax bluf  
Output: red green green  

Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and both result in ""green.""

Input: zup dax bluf  
Output: yellow green green  

Similar to the first input, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", resulting in ""green"" again.

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf  
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red  

Here, ""bluf"" comes at the end after ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red."" In this sequence, ""bluf"" seems to be inducing the output of ""red red"" irrespective of 'wif' appearing before it, since ""wif"" by itself corresponds to a single ""red.""

Input: wif lug zup bluf  
Output: red blue yellow yellow  

In this sequence, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" and it corresponds to a double ""yellow."" 

Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif  
Output: red red yellow yellow red  

Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red,"" and also follows ""zup"" resulting in ""yellow."" When it precedes ""zup,"" the result again is ""yellow.""[

Based on the outputs, we can deduce that ""bluf"" triggers a duplication of the color that corresponds to the word that immediately precedes it:

- ""dax bluf"" results in green green.
- ""wif bluf"" results in red red.
- ""zup bluf"" results in yellow yellow.

Therefore, we can establish the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the preceding word.",0.9,182,bluf
"Observing the examples provided, let's focus on instances where ""bluf"" appears and the corresponding output:

1. wif dax bluf -> red green green
2. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
3. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
4. wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow
5. wif bluf zup bluf wif -> red red yellow yellow red

In examples 1 and 2, ""bluf"" appears at the end, and the last color in the output is green, which corresponds to the word ""dax"" that precedes ""bluf."" 

In example 3, ""bluf"" also appears at the end, and the last two colors in the output are red red, which correspond to the word ""wif"" that precedes ""dax,"" before ""bluf.""

In example 4, ""bluf"" again appears at the end, and the last two colors in the output are yellow yellow, which correspond to the word ""zup"" that precedes ""lug,"" before ""bluf.""

In example 5, ""bluf"" appears twice, once in the middle and once at the end. Each ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif."" The output corresponding to ""bluf"" in both cases is red, which corresponds to the word ""wif.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" determines that the last color in the output echos the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""dax"" or the word preceding ""bluf"" itself, if there is no ""dax"" between the two.

However, we see that in every output sequence the last color is always green when ""bluf"" is at the end, and red when ""bluf"" is in the middle, which results in duplication when the preceding color is the same. We can infer that 'bluf' placed at the end of an input sequence indicates a repetition of the color corresponding to the word before ""dax,"" and in the case of a ""bluf"" in a different position, it repeats the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word.

Therefore, a general rule for ""bluf"" is as follows:

**Rule:**
- When ""bluf"" is at the end of an input sequence, the output is a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""dax.""
- When ""bluf"" is in any other position, the output is a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf.""

This interpretation might need further examples for full confirmation, but based on the provided data, this is a plausible rule induction.",0.7,182,bluf
"walm -> rule. Rule: The word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color of the immediately preceding word. For example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" indicating that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the repetition of ""walm"" repeats the color ""red"" twice more. Similarly, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" showing that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" repeats the color ""yellow"" two more times.",1.0,182,walm

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the input-to-output conversion for the examples provided.

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm

   Here, ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". 

2. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   ""Wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and the additional ""red"" in the output indicates ""walm"" maps to ""red.""

3. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   ""Lug"" maps to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and the additional ""yellow"" in the output suggests ""walm"" maps to ""yellow"" in this case.

4. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   ""Zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and the additional ""yellow"" suggests ""walm"" maps to ""yellow"" here as well.

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   ""Wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and again the additional ""red"" suggests ""walm"" maps to ""red.""

From the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" is contextually dependent and repeating the color indicated by the noun before it. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it results in ""red."" When it follows ""zup,"" it results in ""yellow."" There is no example provided for ""walm"" following ""dax"" or ""lug"" to confirm if it would repeat ""green"" or ""blue.""

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Based on this rule:
walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to repeat.",0.9,182,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the consistent patterns associated with it in the examples given:

1. When ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", the output is multiple reds.
2. When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", the number of yellows in the output increases.
3. When ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"", the next color is blue, and when followed by ""dax"", the next color is green.

Now let's check the consistency:

- ""wif walm"" consistently results in ""red red"" at the beginning of the output, so ""wif"" likely corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" does something else that includes the color red.
- ""zup walm"" consistently results in two yellows in a row, indicating that ""zup"" likely corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" likely includes yellow too in some way.
- ""walm"" followed by another word affects the next color in the sequence, turning it yellow if the next word is ""lug"" and green if it's ""dax.""

Based on this, we can hypothesize that ""walm"" may play a role in repeating the color of the word before it, while also influencing the color of the word following it. However, the exact rule for ""walm"" is not entirely clear due to insufficient data on how it interacts with different preceding words or its position in the sequence.

"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we examine the output associated with each instance of ""dax"" in the provided examples. It appears that ""dax"" always corresponds to the output ""green.""

Here are the observations:

1. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" regardless of their order as seen in the first and fourth examples.
2. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green"" (second and fifth examples).
3. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green"" (third example, which also confirms that ""dax"" is ""green"" when it is the second word).
4. ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" as in the second example, and ""dax"" is ""green"" when it follows ""bluf.""

- In the second example, ""dax"" is preceded and followed by ""bluf,"" which is associated with ""blue,"" but ""dax"" itself corresponds to ""green.""

Input: wif zup bluf lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue

From the examples, we can observe that the presence of the word ""bluf"" always results in the word ""red"" in the output. ""Bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""red,"" irrespective of its position in the input string or the other words around it.

"Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word. 

Explanation: In each example, ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word that comes before ""walm"" to be repeated an additional number of times. 

For instance:
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"", meaning ""walm"" causes ""green"" (which corresponds to ""dax"") to be repeated two more times.
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"", meaning ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" (which corresponds to ""zup"") to be repeated two more times. 

Each time ""walm"" appears, the rule of repeating the color corresponding to the previous word is applied.",1.0,183,walm
"From the given examples, we can induce the following:

- In every example where the nonce word ""walm"" appears, it is translated to ""green.""

Therefore, based on the given data:

walm -> green

Rule: The word ""walm"" translates to the color ""green"" in the output.",1.0,183,walm
"walm -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the color green, independent of its position in the sequence.",1.0,183,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the outputs corresponding to its presence in the input:

1. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" 
2. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" 
3. ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
4. ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red.""
5. ""dax walm wif zup"" corresponds to ""green green green red yellow.""

Breaking down the examples, we can observe the following:
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is three greens.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is three yellows.
- The presence of other words like ""wif"" or ""bluf"" changes the output colors after the ""walm"" pattern.

It seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it three times. For ""dax,"" which translates to green, ""walm"" produces three greens. For ""zup,"" which translates to yellow, ""walm"" produces three yellows.

Hence, the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",0.9,183,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the outputs for each input:

1. ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green."" 
2. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow.""
3. ""zup walm"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow.""
4. ""dax walm wif"" becomes ""green green green red.""
5. ""dax walm wif zup"" turns into ""green green green red yellow.""

Analyzing each example, the word prior to ""walm"" (either ""dax"" or ""zup"") seems to determine the color repeated before a new color is introduced. Additionally, ""walm"" does not change the output color itself but causes a repetition of the color tied to the word before it.

The last two examples show that when ""wif"" is introduced after ""walm,"" a new color ""red"" is included in the output. In the last example, after both ""wif"" and ""walm"" have been used and ""zup"" comes next, the color ""yellow"" appears, adhering to its association with ""zup.""

From these observations, we can infer the following rule:

- When ""wif"" follows ""lug,"" the output color sequence includes ""red.""
- When ""wif"" follows ""zup,"" the output color sequence includes ""red.""
- When ""wif"" stands alone before a word, it outputs ""red"" before the color associated with the following word.

Therefore, it seems that ""wif"" adds a ""red"" before the color associated with the word that follows it. If ""wif"" is the first word followed by another word, the output will start with ""red"" and then the color corresponding to the next word.

Here are the patterns observed:
- lug wif -> blue red
- zup wif -> yellow red
- walm -> red
- bluf -> red
- dax -> green

It seems that ""wif"" is acting as a modifier that adds the color red, but its interaction with additional words can result in a different color. However, with the given dataset, the only other word that follows ""wif"" is ""dax"", which results in green. This does not give us a lot of information about how ""wif"" interacts with other words beyond ""dax"", but for this dataset, it appears the rule is:

- ""lug"" always leads to ""blue"", and this color is not influenced by ""wif"".
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" when not immediately following ""wif"".
- ""dax"" translates to ""green"" when not immediately following ""wif"".
- ""wif"" always introduces ""red"".
- When ""wif"" is followed by another word, it seems to insert ""red"" and then directly translate the following word:
  - In example 1, ""wif zup"" produces ""red yellow"" and ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red"".
  - In example 2, ""wif bluf"" produces ""red red"" indicating that ""bluf"" could be interpreted as ""red"".
  - In example 3, ""wif dax"" produces ""red green"".
  - In example 4, ""wif dax"" produces ""red green"", ""wif walm"" produces ""red green green"".

- ""walm"" by itself produces ""green green green"", but when following a ""wif"", it mirrors the result of the word after ""wif"", except the first ""red"". For example, ""wif dax walm"" gives ""red green green green"" where the ""green green green"" mirrors ""dax"".

Therefore, it seems that ""wif"" could mean ""red and then translate the following word with some alternation rule if the following word is 'walm'"". However, ""wif"" without a following word simply translates to ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red (and then translates the following word applying an alternation rule if the following word is 'walm').",0.9,184,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" appears to function as a modifier that repeats the color associated with the word that follows it. Here are the associations we can derive from the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

- ""lug"" correlates to the color ""blue""
- ""zup"" correlates to the color ""yellow""
- ""dax"" correlates to the color ""green""
- ""walm"" correlates to the color ""red""
- ""bluf"" correlates to ""red""

Now, examining the outputs:

1. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" translates to ""blue red yellow red red red,"" where ""wif"" after ""lug"" leads to one occurrence of ""red,"" and ""wif"" after ""zup"" and ""walm"" results in two occurrences of ""red"" for each.

2. ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red,"" implying that ""wif"" after ""bluf"" results in one additional ""red.""

3. ""lug wif dax"" translates to ""blue red green,"" which indicates that ""wif"" after ""lug"" results in ""red,"" and there is no repetition after ""dax.""

4. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red green green green blue,"" showing that ""wif"" after ""dax"" results in two instances of ""green.""

5. ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green,"" where ""wif"" alone leads to ""red.""

Considering these insights, it seems that ""wif"" by itself introduces ""red,"" and when it precedes another word, it causes the color associated with that word to be repeated once or twice. The discrepancy in the number of repetitions seems inconsistent, but there might be a typo in the examples given, as in input 4 where only one ""wif"" precedes ""dax"" but results in two ""green"" in the output. If we assume this was intended to be ""wif wif dax,"" it would mean that each occurrence of ""wif"" adds an additional repetition of the subsequent color.

Rule: ""wif"" introduces ""red"" when it stands alone and causes one (or more, based on a potential typo in the inputs) additional repetition of the color that corresponds to the following word.",0.8,184,wif
"Based on the examples provided, wif seems to function as a word that denotes the following color repeated once more. After wif, the next color word in the sequence is repeated one additional time per occurrence of ""wif.""

Let’s break down the examples:

1. lug wif zup wif walm
   - ""lug"" becomes ""blue""
   - ""wif"" causes ""zup"" to be repeated once, so ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow"") is repeated once, resulting in ""red yellow"".
   - The second ""wif"" causes ""walm,"" which translates to ""green,"" to be repeated twice, given that ""walm"" occurs right after the second ""wif.""
   - However, ""walm"" is translated as ""red red red"", which is three repetitions, not two, possibly indicating some error in the example. We'll see if this irregularity is present in other examples.
   
   Output: blue red yellow red red red

2. lug wif bluf
   - ""lug"" becomes ""blue""
   - ""wif"" causes ""bluf"" to be repeated once, which is ""red"" based on the Output.
   
   Output: blue red red

3. lug wif dax
   - ""lug"" becomes ""blue""
   - ""wif"" causes ""dax"" to be repeated once, which translates to ""green"" based on the Output.
   
   Output: blue red green

4. zup wif dax walm lug
   - ""zup"" becomes ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" causes ""dax"" to be repeated once, which is ""green"".
   - ""walm"" seems to mean ""green,"" looking at this and the previous examples, but for some reason was translated to ""red red red"" in the first example.
   - ""lug"" is consistently ""blue.""

   Output: yellow red green green green blue

5. wif dax
   - ""wif"" causes ""dax"" to be repeated once, which is ""green"".
   
   Output: red green

Looking at all the examples, it looks like the first example may have either a mistake, or there's an additional rule affecting ""walm"" that isn’t clear from the examples provided.

Thus, the preliminary rule deduced is:
wif -> causes the next color word to be repeated once more

But with the uncertainty around ""walm"" in the first example, we may need to add a caveat that there could be exceptions or additional rules not fully encapsulated by the given information.",0.7,184,wif
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,184,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" seems to be translated as ""yellow"" each time it appears. Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,184,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,184,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we see that ""zup"" is always translated to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, it can be deduced that ""zup"" is a term that corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples.",1.0,184,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be associated with the output ""red red"" consistently when it follows the word ""wif"" and with ""green"" when it stands alone or follows other words. Here are the observations from the examples:

Input: wif bluf dax  
Output: red red green  
- ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red red"", ""dax"" gives ""green""

Input: dax bluf  
Output: green green  
- ""dax"" gives ""green"", ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and still gives ""green""

Input: lug dax bluf  
Output: blue green green  
- ""lug"" gives ""blue"", ""dax"" gives ""green"", and ""bluf"" still gives ""green""

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf  
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red  
- ""zup"" gives ""yellow"", ""lug"" gives ""blue"", ""walm"" is unknown but not immediately relevant to ""bluf"", ""dax"" gives ""green"", ""wif bluf"" gives ""red red""

Input: dax lug wif bluf  
Output: green blue red red  
- ""dax"" gives ""green"", ""lug"" gives ""blue"", ""wif bluf"" gives ""red red""

Looking at these patterns, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it translates to ""red"" when it immediately follows the word ""wif"" and to ""green"" in other contexts.

Rule:   
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", it results in ""red red"".
- When ""bluf"" does not follow ""wif"", it results in ""green"".",1.0,184,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the input and corresponding output for each example and look for patterns associated with the appearance of ""bluf.""

1. Input: wif bluf dax | Output: red red green
   In this example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Since ""bluf"" immediately precedes the second ""red,"" it might suggest that ""bluf"" also means ""red.""

2. Input: dax bluf | Output: green green
   In this example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""green."" This might imply that ""bluf"" either copies the color of the word before it or has a fixed meaning of ""green.""

3. Input: lug dax bluf | Output: blue green green
   Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and since ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green"" again, this supports the idea that ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word.

4. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf | Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   In this lengthy example, ""wif"" is again shown to correspond to ""red"" and follows a ""dax,"" which suggests ""green."" Since ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red,"" this continues to support the idea that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word right before it.

5. Input: dax lug wif bluf | Output: green blue red red
   In this case, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and since ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" its output is ""red"" once again.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,184,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe the following:

1. ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green"". The word ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"", which is translated to ""green"". Since ""wif"" is the only other word and is directly translated to ""red"", we are not able to conclude much about ""bluf"" from this example alone.

2. ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"". Here, ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"", and both translate to ""green"". This may suggest that ""bluf"" means ""green"". However, we need more examples to confirm this.

3. ""lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue green green"". ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""bluf"" also to ""green"". This example reinforces the notion that ""bluf"" could mean ""green"".

4. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red"". The word ""bluf"" at the end translates to ""red"". However, because ""wif"" directly precedes ""bluf"" and also translates to ""red"", it could be influencing the translation of ""bluf"" to ""red"" in this example, thereby not contradictory to ""bluf"" meaning ""green"" consistently in other positions.

5. ""dax lug wif bluf"" translates to ""green blue red red"". In this example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", and both translate to ""red"", as it did in the previous example.

Upon reviewing these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" when it follows ""dax"" or when it stands alone (as in the second example). However, when ""wif"" comes before ""bluf,"" both words translate to ""red"". This suggests a context-sensitive rule for the word ""bluf"":

If ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" means ""red"".
Otherwise, ""bluf"" means ""green"".

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> ""green"", unless preceded by ""wif"", in which case bluf -> ""red"".",0.9,184,bluf
"In the given examples, we can see that the output associated with the word ""bluf"" is consistently ""red red."" This output does not change when ""bluf"" is preceded by other words. Here are the associations:

- wif bluf dax -> red red green
- dax bluf -> green green
- lug dax bluf -> blue green green
- zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
- dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red

Across all examples, ""bluf"" directly corresponds to ""red red,"" regardless of its position relative to the other words (beginning, middle, or end of the sequence). Other words are associated with single colors (e.g., ""dax"" with green, ""lug"" with blue), but ""bluf"" consistently translates to a pair of reds.

Based on this pattern, we can induce the following meaning:

Rule: bluf -> ""red red"" (consistently associated with a double output of the color red)",0.8,184,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine its correlation with outputs in each of the examples:

1. wif bluf dax -> red red green
2. dax bluf -> green green
3. lug dax bluf -> blue green green
4. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
5. dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red

Now we look for patterns:

- In the first and the fifth examples, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""dax,"" which translates to ""red red"" with ""green"" at the end each time. 
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is at the end and surrounded by ""wif"" and ""dax,"" with corresponding colors ""red red"" at the end.
- In the second and third examples, ""bluf"" is immediately followed by ""dax,"" which seems to consistently result in ""green"" as a following color. 

A clear pattern emerges when ""bluf"" is present:

- Whenever ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output color is ""green.""
- Whenever ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""

Therefore, we can deduce that ""bluf"" means ""red"" when it is preceded by ""wif,"" and it means ""green"" when it is followed by ""dax."" If we consider the position of ""bluf"" to be central to its meaning, we can state the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" means ""red"" when followed by ""dax"" and it appears after a ""wif."" When ""bluf"" appears directly before ""dax"" without a preceding ""wif,"" it means ""green.""",0.8,184,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

In each Output, the word ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of the color ""red."" Let's examine the occurrences:

1. In the first example, ""dax wif walm lug zup walm,"" the word ""walm"" follows ""wif"" both times, and it results in a sequence of ""red red red,"" followed by another color after ""lug"" and ""zup,"" and then ""walm"" repeats the ""red"" sequence.

2. In the second example, ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" the word ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" and ""wif,"" resulting in a ""green green green"" followed by ""red red red,"" indicating ""walm"" carries over the color before it in a sequence of three.

3. The third and fourth examples reinforce this pattern, each time ""walm"" appears, it extends the sequence of the preceding color by three more instances.

4. In the fifth example, ""zup walm lug,"" ""walm"" again extends the ""yellow"" sequence by repeating it three more times before changing color after ""lug.""

From these observations, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be that it extends the sequence of the preceding color by repeating it three additional times.

Rule: walm -> extends the preceding color by repeating it three more times.",1.0,184,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the provided inputs and their corresponding outputs:

- When ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" the immediately following indicator is ""red,"" and after ""walm"" is a repetition of ""red.""
  - Input: wif walm zup
  - Output: red red red yellow

- When ""walm"" appears after ""zup,"" the immediately following indicator is ""yellow,"" and after ""walm"" is a repetition of ""yellow.""
  - Input: zup walm lug
  - Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

- When ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" the immediately following indicator is ""green,"" and after ""walm"" is a repetition of ""green.""
  - Input: dax walm wif walm zup
  - Output: green green green red red red yellow

- When two ""walm""s appear in a sequence, the color indicated by the word before the first ""walm"" is repeated three times before other rules resume.
  - Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
  - Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

From the above analysis, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it, repeating as many times as the word ""walm"" is mentioned consecutively. If another word is introduced after ""walm,"" then the rules for that new word take over after the repetitions dictated by ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the previous word, with the number of repetitions matching the number of consecutive ""walm"" occurrences.",0.9,184,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color output that immediately follows it. For instance:

Example 1: ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" translates to ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow."" After ""walm"" we see ""lug,"" which translates to red, and red is repeated twice more. Similarly, after ""zup"" which translates to yellow, yellow is repeated twice after the second ""walm.""

Example 2: ""dax walm wif walm zup"" translates to ""green green green red red red yellow."" Each instance of ""walm"" results in the repetition of the immediate following color—in this case, green and red, respectively.

Applying this observed rule to other examples consistently results in the correct output color sequence.

Rule: walm -> causes the immediate following color word's translation to be repeated three times.",0.9,184,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer a rule regarding the nonce word ""walm."" In each example, every occurrence of ""walm"" seems to be associated with a repetition of the color word that immediately follows its first mention. 

Here's the pattern we can observe:

1. In the first example, after ""walm"" is first used, the word ""lug"" follows, which correlates with ""red."" Afterward, each subsequent ""walm"" also correlates with ""red.""

2. In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" and again, the next ""walm"" stays consistent with the color ""red.""

3. In the third example, ""walm"" comes before ""zup,"" and the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times, just as ""walm.""

4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" which correlates to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" without any repetition, indicating the color associated with ""walm"" is ""green.""

5. In the fifth example, ""zup"" follows ""walm,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times, consistent with the usage of ""walm.""

From this pattern, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: walm -> The word following ""walm"" will have its associated color word repeated for the number of times ""walm"" and the subsequent word appear in sequence.

So, in the context of these examples, ""walm"" functions as an instruction for repetition of the color associated with the word that follows it.",0.8,184,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of the color that immediately follows it. To be more specific, ""walm"" seems to cause the repetition of the color that corresponds to the next word in the sequence. For instance:

- In the first example, ""lug"" after ""walm"" translates to ""red blue,"" and then we have another ""walm"" which again causes ""lug"" to be repeated, resulting in ""red red blue.""

- In the second example, ""wif"" after the first ""walm"" is translated to ""red red red,"" and ""zup"" after the second ""walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

- In the third and fourth examples where ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" the color ""yellow"" repeated three times is the result.

- In the fifth example where ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" ""blue"" is the color that is repeated three times.

From these observations, we can create the following rule:

Rule: walm -> causes the next color word to be repeated three times.",0.8,184,walm
"Based on the given examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" appears to be consistent. In both isolated and combined instances with other words, ""lug"" is translated to the same word in the output. Here's the rule deduced from the inputs and outputs:

"lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color blue.",1.0,185,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,185,lug
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce that the word ""lug"" corresponds to a specific output irrespective of its position or repetition within a given input sequence. Here is the observed pattern:

- In every example where ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue"".
- Whether ""lug"" stands alone or is paired with other words, it consistently translates to ""blue"".
- ""lug"" does not seem to affect the translation of other words; for example, other words like ""dax"" consistently translate to ""green"", and ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"", regardless of whether they are combined with ""lug"" or not.

Using the above observations, we can determine:

lug -> meaning. Rule: ""lug"" translates to the word ""blue"".",1.0,185,lug

"Based on the presented examples, the word ""zup"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""yellow."" It follows each mention of a word that evokes a certain color (dax -> green, lug -> blue, walm -> red), and after ""zup"" is used, the previously mentioned color continues unless a new color is introduced (i.e., a new word).

Examples and corresponding colors:

1. dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green (dax is green, followed by zup which is yellow, dax again for green, and walm continues the green as no new color is introduced)

With the provided information, we cannot determine the rule for when ""walm"" becomes ""green"" or ""red,"" but we can decisively say that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,185,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" functions as a word that changes the color output to an alternation of the ""yellow"" color followed by repeating the color associated with the word just before ""zup."" Here's the breakdown according to each example:

1. dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" introduces yellow followed by repeating the color of the word before ""zup,"" which is ""dax"" hence green.

2. lug zup -> blue yellow
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""zup"" introduces yellow, and no word follows to determine any further pattern.
   
3. lug bluf zup lug -> blue blue yellow blue
   - ""lug"" is blue, ""bluf"" is blue, ""zup"" introduces yellow followed by the color of the word before ""zup,"" which is ""bluf"" hence blue.

4. dax lug zup dax -> green blue yellow green
   - ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" introduces yellow followed by the color of the word before ""zup,"" which is ""lug"" but the pattern is then interrupted by ""dax,"" returning to green.

5. dax zup walm wif walm -> green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   - ""dax"" is green, ""zup"" introduces yellow, ""walm"" and ""wif"" do not have their individual colors declared, but it seems to follow a pattern where ""walm"" is a transition to red, and ""wif"" could potentially be a command to repeat the color that currently follows ""walm,"" which is yellow that turns to red.

From the above examples, it seems that ""zup"" is a transitional word that yields yellow and then carries on to repeat the color of the word preceding it. However, this pattern might be disrupted by certain conditions or additional words that have not been fully illustrated in the examples. For example, the last input-output pair suggests there might be more rules at play than directly illustrated by the concept of ""zup.""

The rule appears to be:

zup -> introduces the color yellow followed by either a repetition of the color before ""zup"" or a continuation of yellow dependent on the subsequent words and context not fully demonstrated by the given examples.

Since ""wif"" appears in three examples and each time it is followed by ""red"" in the output, it's safe to assume that ""wif"" also corresponds to the color ""red"". Therefore, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color ""red"".

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,185,bluf
"From the examples provided, each occurrence of ""bluf"" leads to a repeated word in the output. More specifically:

When other words are added after ""wif bluf"":

- ""wif bluf dax"" produces ""red red green"".
- ""wif bluf lug"" produces ""red red blue"".

Given these patterns, it seems like ""bluf"" on its own instructs to duplicate the color corresponding to the preceding word (""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""). Additional words after ""bluf"" produce colors that correspond to those words without altering the duplication instruction that ""bluf"" provides.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

bluf -> Duplicate the color corresponding to the preceding word.",1.0,185,bluf
"bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: When given a word followed by ""bluf,"" the output is the color associated with that word repeated twice. For example, ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" so ""wif bluf"" yields ""red red."" If additional words follow ""bluf,"" such as ""dax"" or ""lug,"" the color associated with those words are appended to the output after the repeated color. ""Dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and ""lug"" is associated with ""blue.""",1.0,185,bluf
"bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Every time ""bluf"" is present in the input, the output always includes ""red"". The additional examples (such as 'dax' resulting in 'green' and 'lug' resulting in 'blue') seem unrelated to the meaning of ""bluf"" itself.",1.0,185,bluf
"walm -> repeat the previous color. Rule: When you see the word 'walm', repeat the color that was just translated before it.",1.0,185,walm
"Based on the examples provided, where the nonce word ""walm"" is used, the word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the previous color word in the sequence. Each color mentioned before ""walm"" is followed by one or more instances of the same color immediately after it. We can see that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, ""dax"" to green, and ""zup"" to yellow. ""Wif"" corresponds to red but is unaffected by ""walm"" since ""walm"" has not appeared before it to indicate repetition.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it indicates that the color word preceding it should be repeated one or more times immediately afterwards.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color word in the sequence.",1.0,185,walm
"Observing the examples provided, it seems that 'walm' refers to repeating the previous word's corresponding color multiple times. Each nonce word translates to a specific color: 'lug' to blue, 'dax' to green, 'zup' to yellow, and 'wif' to red. When 'walm' follows any of these words, the color that word represents is repeated three times.

Here are the observations based on the examples:

1. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"", where 'lug' is blue, and after 'zup walm' (which is ""yellow""), we have three ""yellow"" in a row.

2. ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red"" where 'dax' is green, and after 'dax walm', we have three ""green"".

3. ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue"" where 'lug' is blue, and after 'lug walm', we have three “blue”.

4. ""zup walm wif"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow red"" where 'zup' is yellow, and after 'zup walm', we have three ""yellow"".

5. ""zup walm"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow"" where 'zup' is yellow, and 'walm' leads to three ""yellow"".

Therefore, 'walm' causes the color of the previous word to repeat three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color three times.",1.0,185,walm
"Based on the provided sentence examples, we can observe patterns of color repetition associated with the nonce word ""walm.""

- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which corresponds to the color blue), the sequence is ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which corresponds to the color green), the sequence is ""green green green.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which corresponds to the color yellow), the sequence is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

In each of these sequences, ""walm"" causes the color that precedes it to be repeated two additional times before returning to the original color.

Rule: walm -> The repetition of the preceding color two additional times before returning to the original color.

Based on this rule induction:
- ""lug walm lug"" leads to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue.""
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green.""
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- And regardless of what follows after ""walm"", the sequence resets to the original color of the word that was before ""walm.""",1.0,185,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the previous color. Here's how the rule applies in the given examples:

1. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
   After ""zup"" which is yellow, ""walm"" repeats yellow twice before ""lug"" which is blue.

2. ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red""
   After ""dax"" which is green, ""walm"" repeats green twice before ""wif"" which is red.

3. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
   After ""lug"" which is blue, ""walm"" repeats blue twice.

4. ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red""
   After ""zup"" which is yellow, ""walm"" repeats yellow twice before ""wif"" which is red.

5. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
   After ""zup"" which is yellow, ""walm"" repeats yellow twice.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the previous word two additional times.",1.0,185,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently results in the color ""blue"" in the Output. Regardless of the other words present (like ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup""), ""lug"" always translates to ""blue.""

So according to the examples:

lug -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: ""lug"" means ""blue.""",1.0,186,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the words that come before or after it. Each example that includes ""lug"" produces ""blue"" in the corresponding position of the output.

Therefore, the rule for the word ""lug"" appears to be:

lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the input contains ""lug,"" the output will include the word ""blue"" at the corresponding position.",1.0,186,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in every instance it appears within the given examples.",1.0,186,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is the color ""blue"".",1.0,186,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in the provided examples, regardless of the position of the word in the input string.",1.0,186,lug
"Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples given, whenever the input includes the word 'dax,' the corresponding output is 'green.' There is a consistent one-to-one correspondence between 'dax' and 'green' across all provided examples.",1.0,186,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence. Here's the reasoning:

- The single occurrence of ""dax"" outputs green.
- When ""dax"" appears multiple times, each instance outputs green.
- ""dax"" does not seem to affect the color output of other words; they have their own consistent color output (e.g., ""lug"" always outputs blue, ""zup"" always outputs yellow).

Hence, the rule appears to be straightforward:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color green in the output.",1.0,186,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" directly translates to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,186,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Each example consistently associates the nonce word dax with the output 'green', independent of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,186,dax
"Given the examples, it seems that each instance of ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position within the input sequence. The surrounding words correspond to other colors but do not seem to affect the color associated with ""dax."" Based on these observations, the rule for ""dax"" can be determined as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,186,dax
"Based on the inputs and outputs provided, we can observe the following patterns:

- When ""wif"" is the only input, the output is ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is immediately followed by another word, the output starts with ""red,"" followed by other colors depending on the word that comes after ""wif.""
- The word after ""wif"" seems to determine the color that follows ""red."" For example, ""walm"" results in ""red red red,"" and ""lug"" results in ""red blue.""

From this, we can deduce:

wif -> meaning: The word ""wif"" seems to represent the color ""red.""

Rule: When ""wif"" is present in the input, the output will always start with the color ""red,"" followed by other colors that are determined by the subsequent words in the input string. If ""wif"" is stand-alone, the output is exclusively ""red.""",1.0,186,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". It seems that ""wif"" retains its meaning regardless of the context in these examples, as it always corresponds directly to ""red"" in the output. Other words in the examples correspond to other colors, but ""wif"" is invariant in its meaning.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,186,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we need to analyze the context in which it occurs and the corresponding outputs. Here are the observations:

- When ""wif"" is the only input, the output is ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is combined with other words, it also results in ""red"" as part of the output, regardless of its position in the sequence.
- Other words like ""dax"" and ""zup"" result in different colors—""green"" and ""yellow"" respectively—and the word ""walm"" generates three repetitions of ""red.""
- The word ""lug"" after ""wif"" results in ""blue.""

Based on these observations, it appears that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" However, there could be additional rules governing the other words and their colors, such as the length of the word, the position of the word, or certain letter combinations. Nonetheless, our task is specific to the word ""wif,"" and the data provided indicates a clear pattern.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,186,wif
"Given the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". Each occurrence of ""wif"" in the inputs corresponds to ""red"" in the outputs. There is no contextual variance or dependencies apparent from the examples, which suggests that ""wif"" is a direct substitution for the color ""red"", without any additional rules.

Rule:
wif -> red",1.0,186,wif
"Based on the input-output pairs provided, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. When the input is ""wif"" alone, the output is always ""red"".
   
   Input: wif
   Output: red

2. When ""wif"" is followed by a second word, the output starts with ""red"" and has another color that may be determined by the second word.

   Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

   Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue

3. When ""wif"" is in a sequence with other nonce words like ""dax"" and ""zup,"" it seems to correspond to the same color ""red,"" and the other nonce words correspond to other specific colors.

   Input: dax wif zup dax
   Output: green red yellow green

   This suggests that each nonce word has a unique color associated with it.

4. The repetition of the word following ""wif"" determines the number of times ""red"" is repeated.

   Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

However, with the given examples, it does not provide enough information to determine the exact rule for how the second word influences the number of times ""red"" appears, nor how the other nonce words (like ""dax"" or ""zup"") map to their respective colors (""green"" and ""yellow"").

Taking the above patterns into account, we can form the following rule:

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". When ""wif"" is followed by another word, this second word influences the number of times ""red"" appears or the pattern of additional colors, although with the examples provided, this specific mechanism is not entirely clear. 

Therefore, although the exact rules regarding the second words are unclear with the provided data, we can definitively say:

wif -> red",0.9,186,wif
"Given the examples provided, we can deduce that each word in the input corresponds to a particular color in the output. The word ""zup"" seems to consistently produce the color ""yellow"" irrespective of its position in the sequence. Thus, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,186,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output sequence. When ""zup"" is present in the input, the output is consistently ""yellow"" for the position where ""zup"" appears.

Therefore, the rule deduced from the examples is:

zup -> yellow",1.0,186,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can infer a pattern where each word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""zup"" seems to produce the color ""yellow"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence. Thus, the rule can be given as:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,186,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

The instances of ""zup"" in the input consistently correspond to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""zup"" within the input sequence. The other words in the input, such as ""dax,"" ""wif,"" and ""walm,"" show a corresponding color that doesn't change regardless of the presence of ""zup."" Therefore, the word ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,186,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that each unique word is translated to a unique color, except for the word ""zup."" ""Zup"" seems to correspond to a color based on its position in the sequence or possibly its relation to the preceding or following word.

However, looking closely at the examples, every instance of the word ""zup"" in the input results in the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or surrounding words. Therefore, it seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""

So, the rule is:

zup -> yellow",1.0,186,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" directly translates to the color ""blue."" By inspecting the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can ascertain the following consistent mappings:

- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""bluf"" -> blue

Therefore, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> blue.",1.0,186,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"". Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""bluf"" is encountered in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,186,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output always includes the color ""blue"" in the corresponding position. Here is the induction based on the examples:

Input: lug bluf wif -> Output: blue blue red
Input: dax zup wif bluf lug -> Output: green yellow red red blue
Input: zup wif dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow red green red red
Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> Output: blue green green yellow blue red
Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

Rule:
bluf -> blue",1.0,186,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word translates to a specific color. ""Bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue."" Therefore, the rule can be defined as follows:

Rule: bluf -> blue",1.0,186,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we observe the following transformations from the input to the output:

- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" transforms differently based on the context provided.

Analyzing ""bluf"" specifically in each example:

1. In the first example, ""lug bluf wif"" translates to ""blue blue red,"" where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"".
2. In the second example, ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" translates to ""green yellow red red blue,"" implying ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".
3. In the third example, ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red green red red,"" implying ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".
4. In the fourth example, ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" translates to ""blue green green yellow blue red,"" suggesting ""bluf"" might mean ""green"".
5. In the final example, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue,"" where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"".

Despite the initial inconsistency, it appears that ""bluf"" duplicates the color immediately preceding it. This becomes clear when we notice that in the first, second, and fifth example, the word that precedes ""bluf"" is ""lug"" (blue), and in the fourth example the word that precedes ""bluf"" is ""dax"" (green). 

In the third example, it might seem at first that the rule is violated since ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" even though the preceding word is ""wif"", which also translates to ""red"". However, if we consider that ""bluf"" should actually match the color word preceding ""wif"" (""dax"" which is ""green""), we can see that there is an error/mistake in this sequence, since ""bluf"" should have been translated to ""green"" instead of ""red"" for the rule to hold true.

Therefore, the most likely rule is:

Rule: bluf -> The color word immediately before ""bluf"" is duplicated (assuming no transcription errors in the examples).",0.8,186,bluf
"Based on the examples given, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to the output of three repeated colors. To determine what color ""walm"" stands for, we should look at the examples where ""walm"" is surrounded by known words/colors and see what triplet of colors is in the output when ""walm"" is in the input:

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Explanation: Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and the output is three yellows following ""zup"", ""walm"" in this context causes a repetition of the color mentioned before it.

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green
Explanation: Here, when ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the output is three greens, mirroring the color that ""dax"" stands for. Therefore, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
Explanation: ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and after ""lug walm"", there are three blues in the output sequence. This supports the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color tied to the preceding word.

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
Explanation: ""Dax"" is associated with ""green"", and after ""dax walm"", there are three greens in the output. 

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Explanation: Again, after ""dax"" which stands for ""green"", ""walm"" produces three greens.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to repeat three times.",1.0,186,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with a tripling of the color word that directly follows it. Here are the rules observed:

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" so ""zup,"" which seems to mean ""yellow,"" gets tripled.
- ""dax walm"" (whether followed by other colors or not) results in ""green green green."" Here, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" leading to ""dax,"" which seems to correlate with ""green,"" being repeated three times.
- The pattern holds regardless of what words are placed before or after ""walm"" in the sequence.
- It's worth noting that ""walm"" does not seem to influence the color words that come before it, only the one that follows.

Rule: When ""walm"" is placed after a color-indicating word, the color corresponding to that word is repeated three times in the output.

So, walm -> meaning: causes the following color word to be output three times.",1.0,186,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern of inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
2. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green
3. lug walm zup lug zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
4. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
5. dax walm -> green green green

It seems that ""walm"" might be a repetition operator that repeats the color corresponding to the word that appears just before it. In every instance, the color that is outputted right after ""walm"" is the same color as the word that appears right before ""walm.""

1. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" we see three ""yellow.""
2. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" we see three ""green.""
3. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" we see three ""blue.""
4. In the sequence ""wif bluf dax walm,"" ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is three ""green"" which corresponds to ""dax.""
5. ""dax walm"" again, corresponds to three repetitions of ""green.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before it three times.",1.0,186,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the consistent patterns in the examples:

1. When ""zup walm"" is the input, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" The word ""zup"" appears once, but three ""yellow"" words are in the output, suggesting that ""walm"" might be responsible for the repetition.

2. Looking at the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and we get ""green green green"" after. This implies that ""walm"" might cause the color corresponding to the word before it to repeat three times.

3. In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup lug zup,"" and in the output, ""yellow"" is repeated three times, followed by later individual translations. This is consistent with the idea that ""walm"" causes the preceding word's corresponding color to repeat.

4. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" in the fourth example, we again see ""green"" repeated three times.

5. The fifth example reinforces the pattern: ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" confirming that ""walm"" repeats the prior color.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" takes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it and repeats that color three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",1.0,186,walm
"walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" is used after a word, it indicates that the color corresponding to the prior word should be outputted three times in succession.

Similarly, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.",1.0,186,walm

- zup corresponds to yellow
- wif corresponds to red
- bluf corresponds to blue
- lug corresponds to blue (it repeats the color as seen in ""lug wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue red blue blue"")
- dax corresponds to green

The color representation is consistent for each word across all examples. With this, we can deduce that:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red in the given examples.",1.0,187,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine each pair of inputs and corresponding outputs:

1. ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red.""
2. ""zup wif zup dax"" translates to ""yellow red yellow green.""
3. ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow.""
4. ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue.""
5. ""lug wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue blue.""

In all these instances, the presence of ""wif"" in the input correlates to the word ""red"" in the output. It's also notable that ""red"" is not at the beginning or the end every time; it appears exactly in the place corresponding to the position of ""wif"" in the input. This indicates that ""wif"" translates directly to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

"Based on the examples provided, each word appears to correspond to a specific color:

Therefore, ""wif"" seems to function as a modifier that prefixes its output with the color red.

Rule: wif -> Prefixes the color red to the color corresponding to the next word.",1.0,187,wif
"Based on the examples provided where the word ""wif"" appears, we can induce a rule relating to the translation of nonce words to colors. Each nonce word corresponds to a specific color as follows:

- zup -> yellow

When we look at the input and output sequences, ""wif"" is consistently mapped to the color red. So the translation or meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" in this context is:

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,187,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems like the word 'bluf' correlates to a specific color in the outputs. As we look through the examples, when 'blur' appears in the input, 'blue' is never in the corresponding output. However, observing the first three examples, we do not see any direct consistent color associated with 'bluf'. 

Let's look closely at the context where 'bluf' appears:

1. (dax bluf lug wif) -> (green green blue red)
2. (zup bluf) -> (yellow yellow)
3. (zup bluf) -> (yellow yellow)
4. (zup bluf wif walm) -> (yellow yellow red red red)
5. (zup dax zup dax wif bluf) -> (yellow green yellow green red red)

We can make a few observations:

- In example 1, 'bluf' follows 'dax', which corresponds to 'green'. After 'bluf', 'lug' appears, which corresponds to 'blue'. This might initially suggest that 'bluf' means 'green' when followed by 'blue', but we need more data to confirm.
- In examples 2 and 3, 'bluf' is the only word other than 'zup', and the outputs are identical ('yellow yellow'). There is no immediate clue here as we don't have the color that correlates directly to 'bluf'.
- In example 4, 'bluf' is followed by 'wif' which corresponds to 'red'. Here, 'bluf' cannot mean 'red' because the sequence 'wif walm' already corresponds to 'red red red'.
- In example 5, 'bluf' is at the end of the sequence, which might suggest an independent color. However, the color 'blue' is not present in the output.

Given all these observations, we can hypothesize that 'bluf' means 'red' because:

- Whenever 'bluf' appears, regardless of what precedes or follows it, the word 'red' appears in the output.
- The output color 'blue' never directly correlates to 'bluf', suggesting the word may not represent 'blue'.
- 'Bluf' cannot represent 'green' or 'yellow', as these colors are accounted for by 'dax' and 'zup'.
- In the final input where 'bluf' does not follow or precede any other color word given (‘wif’ is at the end), 'red' appears twice in the output, which aligns with the presence of both 'wif' and 'bluf'.

Thus, our rule is:

bluf -> red",0.8,187,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer a rule that maps the nonce word to a color code. In each example where the word ""bluf"" appears, the corresponding output is consistent and it does not matter the position of ""bluf"" within the input. 

Looking at the examples:

- In the first input, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- In the second and third inputs, ""bluf"" is not changing the output color, it results in ""yellow"" which is the color corresponding to ""zup.""
- In the fourth input, ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is the same as for ""zup,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" doesn't change the color set by ""zup.""
- In the fifth example, it's placed at the end and results in ""red"" which is different from the other inputs. However, one possible explanation could be that the color before ""bluf"" is ""red,"" potentially creating a rule that ""bluf"" repeats or emphasizes the preceding color.

Despite the inconsistency in the last example, the regularity in the first three examples provides a stronger basis for our rule. Given the majority of the data points to ""bluf"" corresponding to ""blue,"" we can deduce the following:

Rule: bluf -> blue

The rule consistency might also suggest that the final example could contain an error, since all previous instances of ""bluf"" map to the color ""blue"" rather than ""red.""",0.8,187,bluf

Rule: If a nonce word appears before ""walm"", the color associated with that nonce word is repeated three times. If the sequence ends with ""wif"", the color sequence ends with ""red"".",1.0,187,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color word that precedes it. Here's the reasoning:

- In the first example, ""lug walm wif lug"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue"". The word ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and translates to ""blue"". ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" and adds two additional ""blue"" before the color changes due to ""wif"".

- Similarly, in the second example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"". ""Dax"" translates to ""green"", and ""walm"" results in two more instances of ""green"".

- In the third example, ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red"". Again, ""dax"" is ""green"", ""walm"" repeats ""green"" twice, and ""wif"" changes the color to red.

- In the fourth example, ""dax walm lug"" translates to ""green green green blue"". ""Dax"" is ""green"", ""walm"" repeats ""green"" twice, and then ""lug"" changes the color to ""blue"".

- The fifth example, ""zup walm wif"", translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red"". Here ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" twice, and then ""wif"" changes the color to ""red"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the previous color word to be repeated two additional times before another color word appears. If no color word follows ""walm"", then no change in color occurs.

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color word two more times.",1.0,187,walm
"Walm -> triplication of the color indicated by the preceding word. Rule: When 'walm' follows another word, the color associated with that word is repeated three times. If 'wif' follows 'walm', 'red' is appended to the sequence.",1.0,187,walm

3. Input: lug
Output: blue

4. Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red

5. Input: wif lug zup bluf
Output: red blue yellow yellow

From examples 1 and 3, it's clear that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" as both inputs have only the word ""lug"" and both outputs are ""blue."" 

Example 2 introduces a new word ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" since ""lug"" already corresponds to ""blue."" 

In example 4, ""wif"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""red."" Both words must result in ""red"" because ""lug"" is consistent with its meaning of ""blue,"" and the two instances of ""red"" in the output suggest that both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" mean ""red.""

Finally, example 5 demonstrates consistency in the translation of these nonce words. ""wif"" before ""lug"" still translates to ""red,"" ""lug"" stays as ""blue,"" ""zup"" keeps its translation as ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" again translates to ""red.""

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let us break down each group of inputs against their respective outputs to extract the possible rules that apply:

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green
- Here, ""wif"" appears twice and precedes the colors red and red.

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red
- ""Wif"" precedes red here again.

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
- ""Wif"" precedes a series of red colors, with one extra red compared to ""bluf.""

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
- ""Wif"" is followed by red, similar to prior patterns.

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- ""Wif"" is followed by a series of red colors, and ""walm"" appears to add more reds.

From these examples, it is observable that the word ""wif"" is always followed by the color red in the output. The word following ""wif"" seems to determine the number of times red appears or possibly affects the color that comes after red, depending on the input. However, there seems to be a consistent rule that ""wif"" translates to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red. 

This means ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the examples provided.",1.0,188,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" is associated with the color red every time it is mentioned. Each occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to an instance of the word ""red"" in the output. Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,188,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine the patterns of inputs and outputs.

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green
- The presence of ""wif"" seems to correspond with the color ""red.""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow.""
- The word ""bluf"" corresponds with ""yellow.""
- The second ""wif"" also corresponds with ""red.""
- The word ""dax"" corresponds with ""green.""

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red
- The word ""dax"" again corresponds with ""green.""
- The ""wif"" corresponds with ""red.""
- The word ""bluf"" corresponds with ""red"" in this case, but it corresponded with ""yellow"" previously, so ""bluf"" might be context-dependent or an inconsistency is present in the examples.

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
- The word ""dax"" corresponds with ""green.""
- ""wif"" corresponds with ""red.""
- The word ""walm"" corresponds with ""red red,"" but it's not clear yet why it is represented by two instances of ""red.""

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
- ""wif"" corresponds with ""red.""
- The word ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue.""

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- ""wif"" corresponds with ""red.""
- The word ""walm"" corresponds with ""red red.""

Considering the above information, we notice that:
1. The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""
2. Some words correspond to more than one color, such as ""bluf"" and ""walm,"" suggesting that the rule might not be a straightforward one-to-one mapping.

Rule:
wif -> Red
- Each occurrence of the word ""wif"" translates directly into the color ""red."" The length of the output related to other words varies, and it may depend on the additional rules not yet identifiable from the provided examples. The inconsistency with the word ""bluf"" could suggest a typo or an exception to the rule, requiring clarification or additional examples to resolve.",0.9,188,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at each example and the corresponding output:

1. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
   Output: red yellow yellow red green
Here, ""wif"" at the beginning produces a ""red,"" and ""wif"" before ""dax"" also produces a ""red.""

2. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red
Here, ""wif"" after ""dax"" produces a ""red.""

3. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
Here, ""wif"" after ""dax"" produces ""red,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" it seems to add an additional ""red.""

4. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
Here, ""wif"" followed by ""lug"" produces ""red.""

5. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
Here, ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" produces ""red red red.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""wif"" generally corresponds to ""red."" However, when ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" it seems to produce multiple ""red"" outputs. Therefore, ""wif"" seems to suggest red, but it may have a function that interacts with the following word to determine the number of times ""red"" is output.

Rule: wif -> ""red"" (with a possible repetition effect when followed by certain words, like ""walm"" which repeats the ""red"" for each letter in ""walm"").",0.9,188,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to a repetition rule for the following color outputs. Here is the underlying pattern observed:

- ""wif"" by itself translates to ""red"".
- When ""wif"" is followed by another word, it repeats the color that corresponds to that word.

From the examples:

- ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow"" since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green"" since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" since ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"" since ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red"".

To state the rule:

wif -> A rule to repeat the color associated with the following word, starting with ""red"" for ""wif"" by itself.

Rule: If ""wif"" is followed by a word, output ""red"" and then the color(s) corresponding to the word that follows ""wif"". If ""wif"" stands alone, output ""red"".",0.8,188,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe a pattern in which each word corresponds to a color, and the position of the word ""zup"" within the sequence always results in the color ""yellow."" Therefore, the meaning of ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,188,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the patterns present in each translated sentence. Let's assign each input word to its corresponding output color and look for patterns.

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow,"" but from the third and last examples, ""zup"" is also associated with ""yellow.""

Now, let's try to find the pattern for when ""zup"" appears:

1. ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green red green yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and both are ""yellow.""
   
2. ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow."" The word does not include ""bluf,"" but ""zup"" still translates to ""yellow.""
   
3. ""dax lug zup"" translates to ""green blue yellow."" ""Zup"" is at the end and turns to ""yellow"" once again.

4. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" ""Zup"" is at the beginning and translates to ""yellow.""

5. ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue."" ""Zup"" appears twice in this sentence: at the beginning and before the last ""lug,"" and in both cases, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

Based on this information, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sentence or the words around it. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,188,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples provided, whenever the nonce word ""zup"" appears, the output is consistently ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words surrounding it. Therefore, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,188,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to discern a pattern associated with the use of the word 'zup'. By comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs, we can see where 'zup' appears and what color is outputted in its place.

Here are the notable patterns:
- 'zup' is followed by 'yellow' in all occurrences.
- No other word consistently corresponds to 'yellow' in these examples.

Given these observations, it seems that 'zup' reliably corresponds to the color 'yellow'. Thus, we can define the rule as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow

This means that whenever the word 'zup' appears in the input, it translates to the color 'yellow' in the output.",1.0,188,zup
"Based on the given input and output examples, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"":

   Output: green blue yellow

4. Input: zup wif walm 
   Output: yellow red red red

5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug

The word ""zup"" seems to translate to ""yellow"" consistently in each example. When ""zup"" appears, it is followed by the color associated with the last word before ""zup"" (except for the first input, where ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" which is ""yellow"" in the output). However, ""zup"" is itself a word that consistently reflects the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,188,zup
"Based on the examples, we can see a pattern where the word 'bluf' always seems to correspond to the output 'green'. There is no immediate evidence that 'bluf' changes meaning depending on the context; it appears to be consistent across all examples. Hence, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> green.",1.0,188,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the correlation between the input and output in each provided example. Let's examine each pair of inputs and outputs:

1. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   - Before and after ""bluf,"" the word ""dax"" is translated to ""green.""
   - ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""dax"" resulting in ""red.""

2. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   - ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" which results in ""green.""

3. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   - Similar to example 2, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" resulting in ""green.""

4. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue
   - ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""wif,"" resulting in ""green.""

5. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: green green yellow yellow green
   - ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""zup"" resulting in ""green.""
   - ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""dax"" resulting in ""yellow.""

Considering these patterns, ""bluf"" is not necessarily representing a consistent single color, as its output changes based on its context, particularly the words that come before and after it. However, when ""bluf"" is immediately preceded by the word ""dax,"" the output is consistently ""green,"" irrespective of the following word. This pattern holds true in all provided cases with one exception: in the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and leads to an output of ""red,"" but this is the only provided case of such a sequence.

Rule: When ""bluf"" is immediately preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green."" Otherwise, the meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the context that is not entirely clear from the given examples.

bluf -> When preceded by ""dax,"" meaning is ""green."" Otherwise, the rule is inconsistent based on the provided data.",0.8,188,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to a specific color output, depending on the context in which it is used. To determine the rule, let’s examine the presence of ""bluf"" and the corresponding outputs in each example:

- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is green (Examples 1, 2, 3, and 5).
- When ""bluf"" stands alone (not immediately preceded by ""dax""), there is no distinct pattern for the output (Example 4 has ""bluf"" preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""wif"", yet both outputs are green).
- The context of the surrounding words affects the output color, as other words such as ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif,"" consistently translate to the same colors (green, blue, and red respectively), but ""bluf"" changes based on what precedes it.

Since ""bluf"" results in green when following ""dax,"" and there's not enough data to deduce its meaning in other contexts, the best induction from these examples is that ""bluf"" means green when directly following the word ""dax."" There is insufficient information to confidently conclude its meaning in other contexts, so we'll restrict our rule to this consistent case.

"Analyzing the input and output sequences:

- In the second and fifth examples, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" as seen consistently across the first three examples.
- Finally, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" which is evident from the third and fourth examples.

Looking at the correspondence, one color is added for each time ""walm"" is mentioned in sequence. Additionally, the color added appears to match the color assigned to the word right after ""walm."" Therefore, it seems like ""walm"" repeats the color of the next word in the sequence thrice.

"Based on the given examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" can be deduced by looking at the pattern of colours the word is associated with in the output.

1. In the first example, ""wif walm"" together results in ""red red red,"" and ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" Therefore, ""walm"" seems to repeat the colour of the word before it three times.

2. In the second example, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" supporting the pattern identified in the first example where ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word thrice.

3. The third example also supports this rule with ""zup walm"" again resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and ""lug walm"" would theoretically result in ""blue blue blue"" if not for the occurrence of ""zup"" right after.

4. The fourth example, ""wif walm,"" also results in ""red red red,"" further supporting the rule.

5. The fifth example, ""lug walm,"" results in ""blue blue blue"" which is consistent with the rule, so here ""walm"" again repeats the color of the word before it three times.

Rule: walm -> ""Repeat the colour associated with the previous word three times.""",1.0,188,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word 'walm' seems to serve as a repeater for the color associated with the preceding word. For instance, when 'wif' precedes 'walm', 'red' is repeated in the output; when 'zup' precedes 'walm', 'yellow' is repeated; and when 'lug' precedes 'walm', 'blue' is repeated. 

To confirm this:

- In the first input ""wif walm zup walm"", 'wif' corresponds to 'red' and it is repeated three times (instead of just once), directly following 'walm'. Similarly, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' and is repeated three times after the second 'walm'.
  
- In the second input ""zup walm lug wif"", 'zup' (yellow) is tripled, and 'lug' and 'wif' are not affected by 'walm' because they follow it, thus each produces a single 'blue' and 'red' respectively.
  
- This pattern continues consistently through the rest of the examples.

This leads to the rule:

Rule: **walm** -> Causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.
",1.0,188,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", we can look at the correlation between the input and the output sequences. By examining the patterns, it seems that ""walm"" affects the color outputs that follow it.

Considering the first example:

- Input: wif walm zup walm
- Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""wif"" correlates with ""red"", and ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"". After the word ""walm"" is introduced, ""zup"" no longer produces a single ""yellow"" but three ""yellow"" outputs.

Looking at the fifth example:

- Input: lug walm wif zup wif
- Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

The word ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"", and again ""wif"" correlates with ""red"", and ""zup"" with ""yellow"". It can be noticed that after ""walm"", ""wif"" still produces ""red"" but is followed by an extra ""yellow"".

After analyzing all examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color that would have been output next to be repeated three times.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,189,zup
Rule: bluf -> two repetitions of the preceding color.,1.0,189,bluf
"Rule: Based on the given examples, it appears that 'bluf' means repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. To break it down:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after 'bluf', we have ""red red"".
- In the second example, 'wif' precedes 'bluf' and is followed by ""red red"". 
- In the third example, 'zup' precedes 'bluf' and is followed by ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, 'dax' precedes 'bluf' and is followed by ""green green"".
- In the fifth example, the pattern is a bit more complex. 'Zup' precedes 'bluf' and is followed by ""yellow"", and at the end, 'lug' precedes 'bluf' (implicitly, as 'bluf' isn't written but its effect is seen) and is followed by ""blue"".

We can deduce the following:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before 'bluf'. If multiple 'bluf' implications are in a sequence, repeat the sequence of colors associated with the word preceding each 'bluf'.",1.0,189,bluf
"Analyzing the examples provided, let's break down the instances where ""bluf"" appears and its corresponding outputs:

1. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
2. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
3. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
4. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
5. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue

From the given data, ""bluf"" seems to correlate with a repeated output color. In each case, the color corresponding to ""bluf"" is the last color before ""bluf,"" and it’s repeated:

1. zup (yellow) wif (red) bluf -> yellow red red
2. lug (blue) walm (blue) wif (red) bluf -> blue blue blue red red
3. wif (red) bluf lug (blue) zup (yellow) -> red red blue yellow
4. zup (yellow) dax (green) bluf -> yellow green green
5. zup (yellow) lug (blue) zup (yellow) bluf lug (blue) -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue

Based on this observation, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> repeat the last color mentioned before bluf.",1.0,189,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.,1.0,189,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Here are the observations that lead to this rule:

1. In the first example, ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and ""red"" is repeated once.

2. In the second example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red red."" Similarly, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" and ""red"" is repeated twice.

3. In the third example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is ""red,"" and ""red"" is repeated once. The pattern holds.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup dax bluf"" translates to ""yellow green green."" ""Bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" and ""green"" is repeated once.

5. In the fifth example, ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue."" ""Bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated once. ""Lug"" which follows ""bluf"" stands for ""blue"" and is not repeated, showing ""bluf"" only affects the word that precedes it.

Combining these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be a function that repeats the color associated with the word right before ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"".",1.0,189,bluf
"Based on the inputs and corresponding outputs provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be influenced by the word that precedes it. Here is the breakdown for each instance where ""walm"" occurs:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow."" The word ""zup"" by itself corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" here seems to act as a repeater of the previous color.

2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and the output is ""blue blue,"" suggesting the same repeater behavior.

3. In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" again, and the output repeats the color ""yellow.""

4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" once more, and the output is ""blue blue,"" consistent with prior observations.

5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" appears twice, first following ""wif"" and producing ""red red,"" then after ""zup"" producing ""yellow yellow yellow.""

From these observations, the inferred rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color of the word that comes before it in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> ""Repeat the color of the preceding word""",1.0,189,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the given examples, focusing on the positions where ""walm"" appears and the corresponding outputs.

- In the first example, when ""walm"" followed ""zup,"" the output was ""yellow yellow.""

- In the second example where ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue.""

- The third instance has ""walm"" after ""zup"" again, and the output repeats ""yellow yellow.""

- The fourth example with ""walm"" following ""lug"" produces ""blue blue"" once more.

- The last example has two instances of ""walm."" First, it follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red."" Then, it follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow.""

It seems that ""walm"" results in the color word preceding it being repeated once.

Rule: walm -> causes the color word before it to be repeated once in the output.",1.0,189,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the commonalities when the word ""walm"" appears and the corresponding color in the output.

1. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
2. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue red yellow red""
3. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""
4. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" -> ""green blue blue blue yellow red""
5. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""

If we analyze the positions where ""walm"" appears and the corresponding colors, a pattern emerges:

- In example 1, ""walm"" comes after two instances of ""yellow"", which come from ""zup"", and the output for ""walm"" is also ""yellow"".
- In example 2, ""walm"" comes after a ""blue"" which is the output for ""lug"", and ""walm"" outputs to ""blue"" as well.
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows a ""yellow"" from ""zup"", and again the output for ""walm"" is ""yellow"".
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows a ""blue"" from ""lug"", and mirrors this output with ""blue"".
- In example 5, ""walm"" appears twice: the first time it follows a ""red"" from ""wif"" and outputs ""red""; the second time it follows a ""yellow"" from ""zup"" and outputs ""yellow"".

From these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" takes on the color of the immediately preceding word. If no word precedes ""walm"" (as seen in no examples given here), we cannot deduce its color.

Rule: walm’s output color repeats the color of the word immediately before it. If ""walm"" is the first word, more context would be needed to determine its output.

walm -> the color of the preceding word.",1.0,189,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the instances where it appears and the corresponding output:

1. zup walm -> yellow yellow
2. lug walm -> blue blue
3. walm wif zup -> blue red yellow
4. walm lug -> yellow blue
5. dax lug walm -> green blue blue
6. wif walm zup -> red red red yellow
7. zup lug zup walm -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
8. walm zup lug zup walm -> red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Looking at these, we can identify a pattern in the outputs corresponding to ""walm"":

- It often repeats the color that came right before it.
- It may also influence the color that comes right after it, depending on the word that follows ""walm.""

To specify the rule, let's break down the instances where ""walm"" is used:

- After ""zup"" (yellow) and before any other color word, ""walm"" results in another yellow: ""zup walm"" -> yellow yellow.
- After ""lug"" (blue) and before any other color word, ""walm"" results in another blue: ""lug walm"" -> blue blue.
- If ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" it seems that the pattern breaks, as observed in ""wif walm zup"" which translates to red red red yellow. But if we consider ""walm"" to mimic the color before it as its primary function, then ""wif walm zup"" would follow the rule since ""wif"" is red and ""walm"" repeats the red before introducing a new color.

Through these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" is a repeat function for colors. It repeats the color word that comes directly before it, regardless of the color word that comes after ""walm"".

So based on the examples given:

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",0.9,189,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that 'walm' corresponds to the color yellow when preceded by 'zup,' and blue when preceded by 'lug.' Additionally, it follows the pattern of repeating the color of the word that comes immediately before it. 

Here is the breakdown:

1. When 'zup' is followed by 'walm,' the output is 'yellow yellow.'
2. When 'lug' is followed by 'walm,' the output is 'blue blue.'
3. Regardless of the word preceding 'walm,' it adopts that word's corresponding color.

Hence, the rule is:

Let's analyze:

1. When ""bluf"" appears after ""lug"" (e.g., ""lug bluf""), the output is ""blue blue.""

From these examples, a rule can be deduced: ""walm"" refers to the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it. If a color word is mentioned before ""walm,"" then ""walm"" means to repeat that color word in the output.

"Rule: The word ""bluf"" results in the color that represents the first word following it. For example:

- In ""wif bluf dax walm"", ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"", so ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". ""Bluf"" is then followed by ""dax"", so the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"" as well.
- In ""lug bluf wif"", ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf"" and corresponds to ""blue"". ""Bluf"" is followed by ""wif"", so the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"".
- In ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". ""Bluf"" is followed by ""wif"", so the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"".
- In ""lug wif bluf lug wif"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". ""Bluf"" is followed by ""lug"", so the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue"".
- In ""zup bluf lug"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". ""Bluf"" is followed by ""lug"", so the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue"".

"Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the corresponding color of the word that immediately precedes it three times. Here's how the rule is applied to each example:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green,"" and when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow,"" and when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".

- When ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif"" are followed by ""walm"" respectively, their corresponding colors are repeated three times in the sequence they appear.

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

The number of times the color is repeated seems to correspond to the number of times the word ""walm"" appears consecutively.

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's consider the examples provided:

- When the input is simply ""dax,"" the output is ""green."" This suggests that ""dax"" translates directly to ""green.""
- When additional words precede ""dax,"" each word seems to correspond to a different color.
- ""lug"" before ""dax"" results in ""blue green,"" which implies that ""lug"" represents ""blue.""
- ""wif"" before ""lug dax"" results in ""red blue green,"" indicating that ""wif"" represents ""red.""

In the last example with all the different words, the sequence of outputs seems consistent with the previous examples, except for ""zup,"" which is a new word that correlates with the new output ""yellow."" This suggests that each word corresponds to a specific color:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow

Rule: Each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. ""Dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of the position in the sequence.

- Every time ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"".
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green"".
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue"".
- The word ""walm"" is interesting, as it appears once and is followed by ""red red red"". Since ""wif"" also corresponds to ""red"", it seems that ""walm"" may be equivalent to ""wif wif wif"" or simply a repetition of ""red"" three times.

- In ""wif bluf dax,"" ""dax"" follows after ""bluf,"" but because ""bluf"" is directly after ""wif,"" it still corresponds to red. The last ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- In ""lug dax bluf wif dax,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" after ""dax"" also corresponds to green, followed by ""wif"" with red and another ""dax"" with green.",1.0,192,bluf

- In ""wif bluf dax,"" it reaffirms that ""bluf"" is repeating the color of the next word, as ""wif"" is red and ""dax"" is green, resulting in ""red red green.""

- Furthermore, in ""lug dax bluf wif dax,"" ""bluf"" is before ""wif"" and the pattern continues with ""green green red,"" supporting that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word after it, regardless of the colors or words before it.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. The rule can be inferred as follows:

- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" which again shows that ""bluf"" leads to a repetition of the color associated with ""wif,"" which is ""red.""
- The third example is a repetition of the second, reaffirming the rule.
- ""wif bluf dax"" results in ""red red green."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and causes ""red"" to be repeated before ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""
- ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" results in ""blue green green red green,"" maintaining the pattern where ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and ""green"" is repeated before the sequence continues.

Rule: bluf -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,192,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" mirrors the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Here is the evidence supporting this deduction:

1. ""dax bluf"" led to ""green green,"" which shows that ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax"" (green).
2. ""wif bluf"" led to ""red red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" here takes the color of ""wif"" (red).
3. Repetition of ""wif bluf"" confirms the same rule.
4. In ""wif bluf dax,"" ""bluf"" still matches ""wif"" with red, and then ""dax"" is green as per the earlier examples.
5. ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" shows that ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""dax"" (green) just after it, while ""lug"" is blue and does not influence ""bluf"" since it does not directly precede it, and ""wif dax"" follows the colors red and green accordingly.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

"To deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" we shall look at how it operates within different sequences and the output it is associated with.

Here is the breakdown of the examples provided:

- In the first example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which means ""walm"" takes the color associated with ""zup"" and repeats it three times.

- The second example, ""wif walm dax zup,"" leads to ""red red red green yellow."" Here again, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the color ""red"" associated with ""wif"" is repeated three times.

- The pattern continues with ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" resulting in ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red,"" where the ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times.

- ""Dax walm wif zup"" outputs ""green green green red yellow,"" with ""walm"" translating the color associated with ""dax,"" green, into three repetitions.

- Finally, ""zup wif lug zup walm"" yields ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow,"" where the final ""walm"" turns the preceding ""zup"" (yellow) into three yellows.

Walm Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it generates three consecutive repetitions of the color associated with the preceding word.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:
walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,192,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer a pattern of how the word ""walm"" affects the output:

- When ""walm"" follows another word, that word's corresponding color is repeated three times before moving on to the next word.
- When ""walm"" comes at the end of an input sequence, the corresponding color is repeated until the end of the output.

To clarify, here are the identified word-color associations:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

Now, applying the pattern to the nonce word ""walm"":

1. Input: ""zup walm"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""walm"" causes ""zup"" (yellow) to repeat three times.

2. Input: ""wif walm dax zup"" -> Output: ""red red red green yellow""
   - ""walm"" causes ""wif"" (red) to repeat three times, then the sequence continues.

3. Input: ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red""
   - ""walm"" causes ""lug"" (blue) to repeat three times, then the sequence continues.

4. Input: ""dax walm wif zup"" -> Output: ""green green green red yellow""
   - ""walm"" causes ""dax"" (green) to repeat three times, then the sequence continues.

5. Input: ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> Output: ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""walm"" comes at the end, causing the preceding word ""zup"" (yellow) to be the only color repeated.

In the second example, ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow"". ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" repeats the color red twice more. ""Dax"" introduces a new color ""green"", and ""zup"" introduces another new color ""yellow"".

"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should examine the relationship between the input and the output, identifying the pattern for the word ""bluf"" as well as the surrounding words that repeat in various examples.

Analyzing the Outputs:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- Whenever ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue.""
- Whenever ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""

Now we examine the correlation with ""bluf"":

1. When ""wif bluf dax lug"" is the input, the output is ""red red green blue."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" but we know ""wif"" already corresponds to ""red.""
2. When ""wif bluf"" is the input, the output is ""red red."" Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" but it is directly following a ""wif,"" which also means ""red.""
3. When ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" is the input, the output is ""blue green green yellow blue red."" Here, ""bluf"" precedes ""zup"" and corresponds to ""green,"" just like ""dax.""

5. When ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" is the input, the output is ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color of the previous word.""",1.0,193,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" induces a rule related to the color outputs. Here is the breakdown for how ""bluf"" may correlate:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax lug,"" which results in ""green blue."" Notably, ""bluf"" precedes the same color output as ""lug,"" which is blue.
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red."" Here, ""bluf"" matches the color output of the preceding word ""wif.""
- The third example showcases that ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup lug wif,"" resulting in ""green yellow blue red."" In this case, ""bluf"" matches the output of the following ""lug,"" which is blue.
- In the fourth example, ""dax bluf"" becomes ""green green."" Similar to the second example, ""bluf"" has the same output color as the preceding ""dax.""
- The fifth example indicates ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf,"" with the output ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow."" ""Bluf,"" in this case, matches the output of the preceding ""zup,"" which is yellow.

From these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it copies the color output of the word immediately before it. If ""bluf"" is at the beginning or there are no previous color indications, it appears to default to yellow, as seen in the fifth example. Hence, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> takes the output color of the preceding word; if no precedent or ambiguous, default to yellow.",0.8,193,bluf
"Reviewing the examples provided where the nonce word ""bluf"" is used, we can look for patterns to determine its meaning or the rule that it follows:

3. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif ---> Output: blue green green yellow blue red
4. Input: zup dax bluf      ---> Output: yellow green green
5. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf ---> Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

By analyzing these inputs and their corresponding outputs, we observe the following pattern regarding the word ""bluf"":

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the word following it (if present) is repeated as its output color. For example, when ""bluf dax"" appears, the output is ""green green.""
- If ""bluf"" is the last word in the input sequence or is not followed by another word, the word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red"" (see example 2).

Given this pattern, we can deduce the following rule for ""bluf"":

**Rule**: When bluf is followed by a word, the color corresponding to that word is repeated. When bluf appears without a following word or is at the end, it corresponds to the color ""red"".

2. ""dax walm zup walm"" -> ""green green green yellow yellow yellow""; ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow"", each followed by ""walm"", which causes the associated color to repeat three times.
3. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red""; ""walm"" after ""zup"" repeats ""yellow"" three times, and there's no ""walm"" after ""dax"" or ""wif"", so only the colors ""green"" and ""red"" are said once.
4. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""; ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"", hence ""blue"" is repeated three times; ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"", resulting in ""red"" repeated three times.
5. ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" -> ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue""; ""wif"" before ""walm"" leads to ""red"" being repeated, and ""lug"" before ""walm"" results in ""blue"" repeated three times.

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,193,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" results in the output of a color repeated three times. The color seems to be determined by the context or the word that precedes ""walm."" Here's the pattern inferred from each input/output pairing:

1. lug walm → blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""blue"" repeated thrice.

2. dax walm → green green green
   zup walm → yellow yellow yellow
   - Here we see ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" leading to ""green"" repeated thrice, and ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" leading to ""yellow"" repeated three times.

3. zup walm → yellow yellow yellow
   dax walm → green green green
   - The same pattern holds with ""zup"" leading to three ""yellow"" and ""dax"" leading to three ""green"".

4. lug walm → blue blue blue
   - This reinforces the pattern seen in the first example where ""lug"" leads to three ""blues"".

5. wif walm → red red red
   lug walm → blue blue blue
   - ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" which results in ""red"" repeated three times, and ""lug"" still leads to three ""blues"".

Given this consistent pattern, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows: 

Rule: walm -> When ""walm"" follows a word, the output is the color associated with that word repeated three times. The colors based on the examples given are ""lug"" -> blue, ""dax"" -> green, ""zup"" -> yellow, and ""wif"" -> red.",1.0,193,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to be responsible for tripling the color output of the word that directly follows it. In each instance, the word following ""walm"" corresponds to a specific color, and this color is output three times. Here is the breakdown:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" thus ""walm"" following ""lug"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" which means ""walm"" following ""dax"" triples the color ""green.""
- Wherever ""walm"" is used, it triples the next color word in the sequence.

So the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the following color word to be output three times. 

Thus:

walm -> Triples the next color word output.",1.0,193,walm

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" correlates consistently with the output ""red."" There seems to be a one-to-one relationship where each instance of ""wif"" produces the word ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present.

"From the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" results in repeating the color word that comes before it, three times. Here are the observations:

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" seems to repeat ""yellow"" two more times.
- ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue"". ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" two more times.
- ""zup dax lug walm zup"" results in ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow"". Each non-""walm"" word corresponds to a color, and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" (the color associated with ""lug"") two more times.

"walm -> repeated color of the word immediately preceding it. Rule:

When ""walm"" follows a word, the output is the color corresponding to that word repeated the same number of times as there are letters in the word preceding ""walm"".

- In ""zup dax lug walm zup,"" ""lug"" again corresponds to blue, and has three letters, so ""blue blue blue"" is output before the final ""yellow"" for the second ""zup.""
- In ""lug walm dax,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""blue blue blue"" (blue repeated three times) precedes ""green"" for ""dax.""

"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond to the repetition of the color indicated by the word that precedes it, three times. Here is the deduction based on the examples:

- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Now, let's look at the pattern:

- Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow (walm repeats the color yellow three times)
- Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue (walm repeats the last color mentioned, blue, three times)
- Input: zup dax lug walm zup -> Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow (walm repeats the last color mentioned, blue, three times)
- Input: lug walm dax -> Output: blue blue blue green (walm repeats the color blue three times, and then dax adds green)
- Input: zup walm wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow red (walm repeats the color yellow three times, and then wif adds red)

From these patterns, we can conclude:

Rule: walm -> replication of the proceeding color word three times.",1.0,194,walm
"Given the examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color that corresponds to the immediately preceding word. Here are the correspondences that can be inferred:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

When ""walm"" follows these color indicators, it repeats the color of the word before it multiple times, specifically one time more than the number of letters in the color word. For instance:

- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"" (word before ""walm"" is ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" then ""walm"" adds two more ""yellow"" for a total of three because ""yellow"" has six letters).
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue blue"" (word before ""walm"" is ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" then ""walm"" adds three more ""blue"" for a total of four because ""blue"" has four letters).

Additionally, ""walm"" seems to reset when a new color word is introduced:

- ""lug walm dax"" leads to ""blue blue blue green"" (first ""walm"" produces three ""blue,"" then ""dax"" changes the output to ""green"").

Similarly, if ""walm"" is followed by another color word, it outputs the repetitions of the previous color and then the single occurrence of the new color:

- ""zup walm wif"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow red"" (first ""walm"" produces three ""yellow,"" then ""wif"" changes the output to ""red"").

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm repeats the color output corresponding to the word directly before it. The number of repetitions equals one plus the number of letters in the color word (i.e., ""yellow"" has six letters, adding two more ""yellow"" for a total of three repeats). When followed by a new color word, ""walm"" stops repeating and then the output shows the new color.

""walm -> meaning"" can hence be written as:

walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word, plus one more for each letter in that color's name, then switch to the new color if there is one that follows.",0.9,194,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the output in relation to their respective inputs:

1. ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow""
2. ""dax lug walm"" produces ""green blue blue blue""
3. ""zup dax lug walm zup"" produces ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow""
4. ""lug walm dax"" produces ""blue blue blue green""
5. ""zup walm wif"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow red""

From the examples provided, it seems that each unique word in the input corresponds to a color in the output and ""walm"" repeats the color of the word just before it a number of times. Here is the pattern:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Now, examining the occurrences of ""walm"":

1. In ""zup walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" so ""walm"" generates a repetition of ""yellow"" three times.
2. In ""dax lug walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" so ""walm"" generates a repetition of ""blue"" four times.
3. In ""zup dax lug walm zup,"" ""walm"" is following ""lug"" again and produces ""blue"" two times more than the last word before walm, here it was ""lug"" which is mentioned twice so four times ""blue"" is the output.
4. In ""lug walm dax,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and therefore repeats ""blue"" three times before the word ""dax"" changes the color to ""green"".
5. Finally, ""zup walm wif"" again has ""walm"" following ""zup,"" repeating the color ""yellow"" three times, before ""wif"" changes the color to ""red"".

Based on the evidence above, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word as many times as the previous word is mentioned in the input before ""walm"" is stated.

So: 

walm -> repeats the color of the previous word in the output as many times as the previous word is mentioned in the input just before ""walm"".",0.8,194,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" let's examine its occurrence and the resulting outputs:

1. Input: wif lug → Output: red blue
2. Input: dax lug bluf wif → Output: green blue blue red
3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug → Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
4. Input: lug dax → Output: blue green
5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup → Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

From these examples, it can be noted:

- Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.
- ""lug"" does not appear to modify adjacent words as the same word pairs do not consistently cause changes in the output colors. For example:
    ""dax lug"" in the second and fourth inputs both lead to ""green blue.""
    ""wif lug"" in the first input leads to ""red blue.""
    
Given this consistent appearance of ""blue"" following ""lug"", we can deduce that ""lug"" translates directly to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,195,lug
"Observing the given inputs and corresponding outputs, it appears that ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" Every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output.

4. lug dax -> blue green
5. zup dax lug walm zup -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow

By consistently replacing ""lug"" with ""blue,"" the output matches the examples given.",1.0,195,lug
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of the word ""lug"" by analyzing the patterns before and after its appearance in the input and the corresponding colors in the output. Let's look at each pair of input and output one by one:

1. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red, and following ""lug,"" we get blue.

2. Input: dax lug bluf wif
   Output: green blue blue red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" appears after ""dax"" and corresponds to blue, ""bluf"" corresponds to blue as well and ""wif"" again corresponds to red.

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   - ""wif"" relates to red, ""zup"" to yellow, ""bluf"" to yellow again, ""lug"" follows and translates to blue, ""walm"" does not have a known corresponding color, ""dax"" relates to green, and ""lug"" after ""dax"" gives us blue again.

4. Input: lug dax
   Output: blue green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""dax"" to green.

5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   - ""zup"" relates to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""lug"" after ""dax"" gives us blue again. ""walm"" corresponds to blue (inferred from previous examples), and ""zup"" at the end corresponds to yellow.

From the above, we can see that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to blue in the output, regardless of its position or the other words present. Therefore, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: wif -> red,1.0,195,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that each nonce word (""lug"", ""bluf"", ""zup"", ""dax"", ""wif"", ""walm"") corresponds to a particular color. The task is to determine what color ""wif"" corresponds to. 

By comparing the examples, we look for patterns. 

- In every instance where ""wif"" is output as ""red"", there is no preceding word that could serve as an obvious indicator for a change (such as ""wif"" becoming ""red"" after a specific word). Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position or neighboring words.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,195,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that each occurrence of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. To confirm this, we can look at the position where ""wif"" appears in the input and see if the word ""red"" appears in the same position in the output:

- In the first example, ""wif"" appears first and corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" appears last and also corresponds to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" appears second and fifth, and those positions correspond to ""red"" in the output, with the final ""walm"" corresponding to repeated ""red"" which deviates from the one-to-one correspondence we see with other words.
- In the fourth example, there is a single ""wif"" between two ""zup""s, and the output consists of ""yellow red yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" appears in the second and last position, each of which corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

Considering the patterns observed, we can deduce that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" but in the third input example, the word ""walm"" breaks this pattern by not having a corresponding unique color; instead, it repeats the previously mentioned color. Therefore, the general rule we can derive for ""wif"" while ignoring the ""walm"" anomaly is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,195,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in every given input-output example.",1.0,195,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to a color, but the color it represents changes in a pattern that depends on the preceding colors. Examining the outputs, where ""wif"" appears, it is followed by ""red"". However, in the third example, it says ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"", which suggests ""wif"" not only translates to ""red"" but possibly influences the following words.

To deduce the rule, let's look closely at the examples:

1. Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green

- ""wif"" is followed by ""red""
- ""lug"" is followed by ""blue""
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue""
- ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow""
- ""dax"" is followed by ""green""

2. Input: dax zup wif
   Output: green yellow red

- ""dax"" is followed by ""green""
- ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow""
- ""wif"" is followed by ""red""

3. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

- ""dax"" is followed by ""green""
- ""wif"" is followed by ""red""
- ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow""
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"" which breaks the simple one-to-one relationship

4. Input: zup wif zup
   Output: yellow red yellow

- ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow""
- ""wif"" is followed by ""red""

5. Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
   Output: blue red red blue red

- ""lug"" is followed by ""blue""
- ""wif"" is followed by ""red""
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""red"", which contradicts example 1

Considering the anomaly in example 5, where ""bluf"" is followed by ""red"" instead of ""blue,"" and example 3, where ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"", we can speculate that ""wif"" could act as a reset or an override mechanism that changes the subsequent color representations into ""red"". However, without a consistent behavior for ""walm,"" it's difficult to validate that within the provided examples.

Nevertheless, focusing on the consistent pattern where ""wif"" results in ""red,"" here is the deduction:

Rule: When ""wif"" appears in an input sequence, it corresponds to the output color ""red"". But there are hints that ""wif"" might affect the color represented by the immediately following word, turning it into ""red"" as well. The rule for ""wif"" combined with other words (like ""walm"") cannot be confidently established without further examples.

For the current data, the safe deduction is:

wif -> red",0.7,195,wif
"zup -> yellow. Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" is present, output ""yellow."" The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of the context.",1.0,195,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of the context it is used in. Every time ""zup"" is an input, the output always starts with the color yellow.

Rule:
zup -> yellow",1.0,195,zup

Whenever zup is mentioned, the output always includes the color yellow regardless of the context or the presence of other words. ",1.0,195,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of ""zup"" in the input directly results in ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of what other words follow or precede it. This consistent correlation suggests that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""",1.0,195,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the outputs associated with each example and identify the patterns.

In the first example, ""wif bluf"" resulted in ""green red red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" could be related to the color red. However, in subsequent examples, ""bluf"" does not always translate to just ""red."" It seems to repeat the color that comes directly before it. 

- In the first input, ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green red red,"" so ""bluf"" translates to the color that ""wif"" corresponds to, which is red.
- In the second input, ""bluf wif"" corresponds to ""yellow red red,"" so once again, ""bluf"" takes on the color before it, yellow, followed by ""wif's"" corresponding color, red.
- In the third input, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" implying ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""dax,"" which is green.
- In the fourth input, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" so ""bluf"" mimics the preceding color, which was yellow.
- In the fifth input, ""dax bluf"" again results in ""green green,"" showing that ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with ""dax.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",1.0,195,bluf
"Analyzing the provided examples:

1. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

3. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow

4. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

5. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green

From these examples, we can infer the following correlations between the input words and output colors:

- zup -> yellow,
- lug -> blue,
- walm -> yellow,
- dax -> green,
- wif -> red.

Given the above correlations, it appears that the word bluf correlates with a repetition of the prior color in the following sequence. To test this pattern, let's see if the rule holds for each example:

1. bluf should result in red, because it follows ""wif"" which gives red. The pattern holds: red red.
2. bluf should result in yellow, because it follows ""zup"" which gives yellow. The pattern holds: yellow yellow.
3. bluf should result in green, as it follows ""dax"" which is green. The pattern holds: green green.
4. bluf should result in yellow, since it follows ""zup"" which is yellow. The pattern holds: yellow yellow.
5. bluf should result in green, since it follows ""dax"" which is green. The pattern holds: green green.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color denoted by the word immediately before bluf.",1.0,195,bluf
"Based on the observed pattern, it seems that ""bluf"" alters the output not directly with a constant color but rather by duplicating the color that would have been produced by the word right before ""bluf.""

For example:
- In the first input ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""green,"" and in the output, we get ""green red red"". The ""red"" is duplicated as a result of ""bluf.""
- In the second input ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and in output, we get ""red red red"". The ""red"" is duplicated following ""bluf.""
- In the third input ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the output shows ""green green yellow,"" with the ""green"" color duplicated.
- Subsequent examples further corroborate this understanding as they show duplicated outputs for the word prior to ""bluf"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" causes the next color in the sequence to become the same as the previous color.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the output color that comes before it.",0.8,195,bluf
"To figure out the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the color patterns in the output and their correspondence with the input words.

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf  
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Input: zup bluf wif walm  
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Input: dax bluf zup  
Output: green green yellow

Input: dax zup bluf  
Output: green yellow yellow

Input: zup dax bluf  
Output: yellow green green

From the patterns above, we can see the following correlations:

- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green.""
- ""wif"" and ""walm"" both seem to relate to ""red.""

Now let's look specifically at ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is at the end, and we get ""red red"" at the end of the output.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and in the output, there is one ""yellow"" followed by ""red red.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and we have ""green"" followed by a ""green"" in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and in the output, ""yellow"" is followed by ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and ""green"" is followed by ""green"" in the output.

From the examples, we can induce that ""bluf"" causes the color that corresponds to the preceding word to ""double"" in the sequence, except in cases where the preceding color is yellow, in which case the output is yellow followed by red red, indicating a possible exception to the doubling rule.

Rule: bluf -> causes the previous color to repeat, with a specific exception when the preceding color is yellow, it leads to ""yellow red red.""",0.8,195,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we observe a correlation between the occurrences of the nonce word ""bluf"" and the repetition of the last color mentioned before it in the output sequence. Here are the observations:

1. In ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""green."" The output then repeats ""red"" twice.
2. In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" The output then repeats ""red"" three times.
3. In ""dax bluf zup,"" ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" The output then repeats ""yellow"" twice.
4. In ""dax zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" The output then repeats ""yellow"" twice.
5. In ""zup dax bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" The output then repeats ""green"" twice.

Combining these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" is an instruction to repeat the color corresponding to the last word before ""bluf,"" and it repeats that color a certain number of times, which correlates with the presence of other words after ""bluf"". In all cases, it repeats the previous color at least once, and then depends on the number of words after ""bluf"":

- If there is one word after ""bluf"" (examples 3 and 4), repeat once.
- If there are no words after ""bluf"" (example 5), repeat once.
- If there are more than one word after ""bluf"" (example 1 and 2), repeat as many times as there are words after it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word in the sequence. The number of repetitions is one plus the number of words following ""bluf"" in the sequence.",0.8,195,bluf
"Analyzing the provided examples, I notice that the word ""walm"" influences the color that follows it rather than corresponding to a color itself. It seems to cause the next color to repeat the color that precedes ""walm."" Here is the pattern I observe:

1. ""zup walm lug"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" ""Walm"" precedes ""lug,"" which then results in ""yellow,"" the same color as ""zup.""
2. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" turns into ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red."" Here, ""walm"" precedes another ""zup,"" resulting in ""blue,"" which is the color for ""lug.""
3. ""zup walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red."" Again, ""walm"" precedes ""lug,"" repeated as ""yellow.""
4. ""wif walm dax zup"" turns into ""red red red green yellow."" ""Walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" and red is repeated.
5. ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red."" After ""walm"" there is no other word, but the pattern of repeating the previous color still holds true.

Rule:
walm -> causes the next color to repeat the color that precedes ""walm."" If there's no color after ""walm,"" it repeats the last mentioned color.",1.0,195,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the output after each occurrence of ""walm"" in context with the input:

- After ""zup walm lug,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" The word ""lug"" follows ""walm"" and the color ""blue"" follows three ""yellow."" We see that ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow"" in all examples.

- After ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" the output is ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red."" Again, we see ""blue"" following the sequence of ""yellow"" after ""walm.""

- After ""zup walm lug wif,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue red."" The pattern of ""yellow yellow yellow"" before ""blue"" is consistent with ""walm"" being present.

- After ""wif walm dax zup,"" the output is ""red red red green yellow."" Despite the change in words following ""walm,"" the pattern of three identical colors followed by a different color appears again.

- After ""lug wif walm,"" the output is ""blue red red red."" This is the first example where we don't see a color following the pattern of three, but it still adheres to the pattern of multiple reds following ""walm.""

From the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the following word to be outputted three times in the color associated with that word before moving on to the next word. However, in the last example, ""lug wif walm,"" we do not see any word after ""walm,"" yet we have ""red red red,"" which fits the ""three times"" pattern but does not correlate to a following word.

Given this apparent discrepancy and the fact that other words' meanings can be deduced based on color repetition, a possible rule for ""walm"" could be that it repeats the color of the following word three times. However, without further examples, we can't rule out that ""walm"" is actually a color by itself that is outputted thrice no matter the context. Therefore, the most consistent rule we can derive from these examples is:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the color of the word immediately following it to output three times. If there is no following word, output the color associated with ""walm"" itself three times (which seems to be red in the given context).",0.8,195,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to influence the color output that follows its use. In every instance of ""walm"" in the input, the color ""red"" is consistently used for all subsequent words until a different word is repeated. Once a word is repeated (e.g., ""lug"" or ""zup""), the sequence of red stops and reverts to the colors that those words are associated with.

However, there is a pattern that can be observed with the word ""walm"":

- After ""walm"" is mentioned, the color ""red"" is produced for the next word regardless of what that word is, as seen in each example.
- This pattern continues (outputting ""red"") until the sequence is interrupted by a repeated word, such as ""lug"" or ""zup"", at which point the output color reverts to the previous pattern associated with those words.

Hence, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" can be identified as:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output to be ""red"" for all following words until a word is repeated, at which point the output color changes to the pattern associated with the repeated word.

walm -> meaning. Red output for following words until a word is repeated.",0.8,195,walm
"Observing each instance of ""walm"" and the corresponding outputs, we can deduce the following:

- Every time ""walm"" appears, it precedes a sequence of colors where the following color is repeated three times and the color matching the word just before ""walm"" is repeated once more after the triplet.

For example:
- In the first input ""zup walm lug"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated three times followed by ""blue,"" which corresponds to ""lug.""
- In the fifth example ""lug wif walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". After ""walm"", ""red"" appears three times, and then ""blue"" appears once more.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" signifies a repetition of the color word that follows it three times, and then an additional instance of the color word that was immediately before it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the following color word thrice and then the preceding color word once.",0.8,195,walm
"In reviewing the examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with the word that follows it taking on the color value of the word that precedes ""walm."" When ""walm"" is present, the word immediately following it is assigned the same color output as the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Here's a breakdown:

- In the first example, ""zup walm lug,"" both ""zup"" and ""lug"" following ""walm"" have the color ""yellow"", which is the color for ""zup.""
- In the second example, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" the words ""lug"" and ""zup"" following ""walm"" both have the same color output as the preceding word ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""zup walm lug wif,"" both ""lug"" after ""walm"" and the subsequent ""wif"" have the color ""yellow,"" which is the color for ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif walm dax zup,"" the ""dax"" following ""walm"" has the same color ""red"" as the preceding ""wif.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug wif walm,"" the ""wif"" following ""walm"" is red, which is the color for both the preceding and following ""wif.""

So, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the following word to replicate the color value of the preceding word. If no word follows ""walm,"" as in the fifth example, it would replicate the color of the preceding word for itself.

Rule: walm -> causes the following word to take on the color value of the preceding word. If no word follows, ""walm"" itself takes on the color value of the preceding word.",0.8,195,walm

- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
- ""lug"" is not found in the input examples, but if we follow the pattern of ""bluf"" leading to ""blue,"" we might infer that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" as well, given that ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" in the output in the third example.

"Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the pattern related to the word ""walm"" and its corresponding output. Upon examination, it appears that ""walm"" is consistently translated to the color ""green."" Additionally, ""walm"" causes the color before it to be repeated for every occurrence of ""walm.""

Let's break down each example to demonstrate this:

- In the first example, ""lug dax walm"" translates to ""blue green green green."" The color before ""walm"" is ""green"" (corresponding to ""dax""), and it's repeated three times, indicating that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the preceding color.
  
- In the second example, ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" translates to ""blue green yellow green green green red."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" and ""green"" is repeated three times again after ""walm,"" consistent with the rule.

- In the third example, ""dax walm zup lug dax"" gives ""green green green yellow blue green."" Once again, ""green"" is repeated twice after ""walm.""

- For the fourth example, ""zup walm lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" so ""yellow"" is repeated after ""walm.""

- Finally, in the last example, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue green red blue red."" Here again, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (""blue""), and ""blue"" is repeated after ""walm.""

Given the evidence from the examples, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" multiple times, depending on the number of occurrences of ""walm"". 

In other words, ""walm"" itself translates to the immediate preceding color and causes that color to repeat.",1.0,196,walm
"Reviewing the provided examples, the term 'walm' seems to be associated with a repetition of the color that immediately follows its first mention. That is, after the word 'walm' appears, the next color word is repeated as many times as 'walm' appeared in the sequence.

"Based on the presented examples, the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it, repeated three times. 

To illustrate:

1. In ""wif bluf dax walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""bluf"" corresponds to red, and ""dax"" corresponds to green. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it produces ""green green green.""
2. In ""dax wif walm lug zup walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" to red, ""lug"" to blue, and ""zup"" to yellow. ""walm"" follows ""wif"" for ""red red red,"" and it follows ""zup"" for ""yellow yellow yellow.""
3. In ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""bluf"" to blue, and ""wif"" to red. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it produces ""red red red.""
4. In ""wif dax lug walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" to green, and ""lug"" to blue. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it produces ""blue blue blue.""
5. In ""dax lug walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""lug"" to blue. Following ""lug,"" ""walm"" produces ""blue blue blue.""

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word that precedes it three times.",1.0,199,walm
"Analyzing each input and its corresponding output, the appearance of ""walm"" in the input correlates with repeated color outputs in the end. More specifically, the number of repetitions of the last color before ""walm"" appears seems to match the number of times ""walm"" is used. Additionally, each word before ""walm"" translates to a specific color.

To confirm this, let's check the instances where ""walm"" is used:

1. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green""
2. ""lug zup walm"" results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow""
3. ""wif walm lug"" results in ""red red red blue""
4. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""
5. ""lug walm lug"" results in ""blue blue blue blue""

From these examples, it's clear that the instances of ""walm"" are repeating the color outputted right before it three times in addition to the first mention (which is translated from the previous word). Thus:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the last color output an additional three times.

Rule: If ""x"" is a word that outputs the color ""y"", ""x walm"" translates to ""y"" being repeated four times in total.",0.9,199,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with the color it precedes being repeated a certain number of times in the output.

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green"". In the output, green is repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" corresponding to ""blue"" and then it follows ""zup,"" not present elsewhere, but the pattern of three repeats continues with ""blue"" being repeated once and ""yellow"" being repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" corresponding to ""red,"" and ""red"" is repeated twice.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" corresponding to ""blue,"" and ""blue"" is repeated twice.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" also follows ""lug,"" corresponding as before to ""blue,"" which is again repeated twice.

The general rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color it follows to be repeated two additional times in the output, except when a new color or item is introduced immediately after ""walm"", in which case, the new color is introduced and then repeated twice. So, ""walm"" acts as a signal to repeat the color an additional two times or introduce a new color sequence of three.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color twice more in the output, or introduce a new color and repeat it twice if the color has changed immediately after ""walm"".",0.8,199,walm
